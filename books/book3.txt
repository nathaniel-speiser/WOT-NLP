PROLOGUE

Fortress of the Light

Pedron Niall’s aged gaze wandered about his private audience chamber, but dark eyes hazed
with thought saw nothing. Tattered wall hangings, once battle banners of the enemies of his youth,
faded into dark wood paneling laid over stone walls, thick even here in the heart of the Fortress of the
Light. The single chair in the room—heavy, high-backed, and almost a throne—was as invisible to
him as the few scattered tables that completed the furnishings. Even the white-cloaked man kneeling
with barely restrained eagerness on the great sunburst set in the wide planks of the floor had vanished
from Niall’s mind for the moment, though few would have dismissed him so lightly.
Jaret Byar had been given time to wash before being brought to Niall, but both his helmet and his
breastplate were dulled from travel and battered from use. Dark, deep-set eyes shone with a feverish,
urgent light in a face that seemed to have had every spare scrap of flesh boiled away. He wore no
sword—none was allowed in Niall’s presence—but he seemed poised on the edge of violence, like a
hound awaiting the loosing of the leash.
Twin fires on long hearths at either end of the room held off the late winter cold. It was a plain,
soldier’s room, really, everything well made but nothing extravagant—except for the sunburst.
Furnishings came to the audience chamber of the Lord Captain Commander of the Children of the
Light with the man who rose to the office; the flaring sun of coin gold had been worn smooth by
generations of petitioners, replaced and worn smooth again. Gold enough to buy any estate in
Amadicia, and the patent of nobility to go with it. For ten years Niall had walked across that gold and
never thought of it twice, any more than he thought of the sunburst embroidered across the chest of his
white tunic. Gold held little interest for Pedron Niall.
Eventually his eyes went back to the table next to him, covered with maps and scattered letters
and reports. Three loosely rolled drawings lay among the jumble. He took one up reluctantly. It did
not matter which; all depicted the same scene, though by different hands.
Niall’s skin was as thin as scraped parchment, drawn tight by age over a body that seemed all
bone and sinew, but there was nothing of frailty about him. No man held Niall’s office before his hair
was white, nor did any man softer than the stones of the Dome of Truth. Still, he was suddenly aware
of the tendon-ridged back of the hand holding the drawing, aware of the need for haste. Time was
growing short. His time was growing short. It had to be enough. He had to make it enough.
He made himself unroll the thick parchment halfway, just enough to see the face that interested
him. The chalks were a little smudged from travel in saddlebags, but the face was clear. A gray-eyed
youth with reddish hair. He looked tall, but it was hard to say for certain. Aside from the hair and the
eyes, he could have been set down in any town without exciting comment.
“This . . . this boy has proclaimed himself the Dragon Reborn?” Niall muttered.
The Dragon. The name made him feel the chills of winter and age. The name borne by Lews
Therin Telamon when he doomed every man who could channel the One Power, then or ever after, to

insanity and death, himself among them. It was more than three thousand years since Aes Sedai pride
and the War of the Shadow had brought an end to the Age of Legends. Three thousand years, but
prophecy and legend helped men remember—the heart of it, at least, if the details were gone. Lews
Therin Kinslayer. The man who had begun the Breaking of the World, when madmen who could tap
the power that drove the universe leveled mountains and sank ancient lands beneath the seas, when
the whole face of the earth had been changed and all who survived fled like beasts before a wildfire.
It had not ended until the last male Aes Sedai lay dead, and a scattered human race could begin trying
to rebuild from the rubble—where even rubble remained. It was burned into memory by the stories
mothers told children. And prophecy said the Dragon would be born again.
Niall had not really meant it for a question, but Byar took it for one. “Yes, my Lord Captain
Commander, he has. It is a worse madness than any false Dragon I’ve ever heard of. Thousands have
declared for him already. Tarabon and Arad Doman are in civil war, as well as at war with each
other. There is fighting all across Almoth Plain and Toman Head, Taraboner against Domani against
Darkfriends crying for the Dragon—or there was fighting until winter chilled most of it. I’ve never
seen it spread so quickly, my Lord Captain Commander. Like throwing a lantern into a hay barn. The
snow may have damped it down, but come spring, the flames will burst out hotter than before.”
Niall cut him off with a raised finger. Twice already Niall had let him tell his story through, his
voice burning with anger and hate. Parts of it Niall knew from other sources, and in some areas he
knew more than Byar, but each time he heard it, it goaded him anew. “Geofram Bornhald and a
thousand of the Children dead. And Aes Sedai did it. You have no doubts, Child Byar?”
“None, my Lord Captain Commander. After a skirmish on the way to Falme, I saw two of the
Tar Valon witches. They cost us more than fifty dead before we stuck them full of arrows.”
“You are sure—sure they were Aes Sedai?”
“The ground erupted under our feet.” Byar’s voice was firm and full of belief. He had little
imagination, did Jaret Byar; death was part of a soldier’s life, however it came. “Lightnings struck
our ranks out of a clear sky. My Lord Captain Commander, what else could they have been?”
Niall nodded grimly. There had been no male Aes Sedai since the Breaking of the World, but the
women who still claimed that title were bad enough. They prated of their Three Oaths: to speak no
word that was not true, to make no weapon for one man to kill another, to use the One Power as a
weapon only against Darkfriends or Shadowspawn. But now they had showed those oaths for the lies
they were. He had always known no one could want the power they wielded except to challenge the
Creator, and that meant to serve the Dark One.
“And you know nothing of those who took Falme and killed half of one of my legions?”
“Lord Captain Bornhald said they called themselves Seanchan, my Lord Captain Commander,”
Byar said stolidly. “He said they were Darkfriends. And his charge broke them, even if they killed
him.” His voice gained intensity. “There were many refugees from the city. Everyone I spoke to
agreed the strangers had broken and fled. Lord Captain Bornhald did that.”
Niall sighed softly. They were almost the same words Byar had used the first two times about
the army that had seemingly come out of nowhere to take Falme. A good soldier, Niall thought, so
Geofram Bornhald always said, but not a man to think for himself.
“My Lord Captain Commander,” Byar said suddenly, “Lord Captain Bornhalddid command me
to stand aside from the battle. I was to watch, and report to you. And tell his son, Lord Dain, how he
died.”
“Yes, yes,” Niall said impatiently. For a moment he studied Byar’s hollow-cheeked face, then
added, “No one doubts your honesty or courage. It is exactly the sort of thing Geofram Bornhald

would do, facing a battle in which he feared his entire command might die.” And not the sort of thing
you have imagination enough to think up.
There was nothing more to learn from the man. “You have done well, Child Byar. You have my
leave to carry word of Geofram Bornhald’s death to his son. Dain Bornhald is with Eamon Valda—
near Tar Valon at last report. You may join them.”
“Thank you, my Lord Captain Commander. Thank you.” Byar rose to his feet and bowed deeply.
Yet as he straightened, he hesitated. “My Lord Captain Commander, we were betrayed.” Hatred gave
his voice a saw-toothed edge.
“By this one Darkfriend you spoke of, Child Byar?” He could not keep an edge out of his own
voice. A year’s planning lay in ruins amid the corpses of a thousand of the Children, and Byar wanted
to talk only of this one man. “This young blacksmith you’ve only seen twice, this Perrin from the Two
Rivers?”
“Yes, my Lord Captain Commander. I do not know how, but I know he is to blame. I know it.”
“I will see what can be done about him, Child Byar.” Byar opened his mouth again, but Niall
raised a thin hand to forestall him. “You may leave me now.” The gaunt-faced man had no choice but
to bow again and leave.
As the door closed behind him, Niall lowered himself into his high-backed chair. What had
brought on Byar’s hatred of this Perrin? There were far too many Darkfriends to waste energy on
hating any particular one. Too many Darkfriends, high and low, hiding behind glib tongues and open
smiles, serving the Dark One. Still, one more name added to the lists would do no harm.
He shifted on the hard chair, trying to find comfort for his old bones. Not for the first time he
thought vaguely that perhaps a cushion would not be too much luxury. And not for the first time, he
pushed the thought away. The world tumbled toward chaos, and he had no time to give in to age.
He let all the signs that foretold disaster swirl through his mind. War gripped Tarabon and Arad
Doman, civil war ripped at Cairhien, and war fever was rising in Tear and Illian, old enemies as they
were. Perhaps these wars meant nothing in themselves—men fought wars—but they usually came one
at a time. And aside from the false Dragon somewhere on Almoth Plain, another tore at Saldaea, and
a third plagued Tear. Three at once. They must all be false Dragons. They must be!
A dozen small things besides, some perhaps only baseless rumors, but taken together with the
rest. . . . Sightings of Aiel reported as far west as Murandy, and Kandor. Only two or three in one
place, but one or a thousand, Aiel had come out of the Waste just once in all the years since the
Breaking. Only in the Aiel War had they ever left that desolate wilderness. The Atha’an Miere, the
Sea Folk, were said to be ignoring trade to seek signs and portents—of what, exactly, they did not say
—sailing with ships half full or even empty. Illian had called the Great Hunt of the Horn for the first
time in almost four hundred years, had sent out the Hunters to seek the fabled Horn of Valere, which
prophecy said would summon dead heroes from the grave to fight in Tarmon Gai’don, the Last Battle
against the Shadow. Rumor said the Ogier, always so reclusive that most common people thought
them only legend, had called meetings between their far-flung stedding.
Most telling of all, to Niall, the Aes Sedai had apparently come into the open. It was said they
had sent some of their sisters to Saldaea to confront the false Dragon Mazrim Taim. Rare as it was in
men, Taim could channel the One Power. That was a thing to fear and despise in itself, and few
thought a man like that could be defeated except with the aid of Aes Sedai. Better to allow Aes Sedai
help than to face the inevitable horrors when he went mad, as such men inevitably did. But Tar Valon
had apparently sent other Aes Sedai to support the other false Dragon at Falme. Nothing else fit the
facts.

The pattern chilled the marrow in his bones. Chaos multiplied; what was unheard of, happening
again and again. The whole world seemed to be milling, stirring near the boil. It was clear to him.
The Last Battle really was coming.
All his plans were destroyed, the plans that would have secured his name among the Children of
the Light for a hundred generations. But turmoil meant opportunity, and he had new plans, with new
objectives. If he could keep the strength and will to carry them out. Light, let me hold on to life long
enough.
A deferential tap on the door brought him out of his dark thoughts. “Come!” he snapped.
A servant in coat and breeches of white-and-gold bowed his way in. Eyes to the floor, he
announced that Jaichim Carridin, Anointed of the Light, Inquisitor of the Hand of the Light, came at
the command of the Lord Captain Commander. Carridin appeared on the man’s heels, not waiting for
Niall to speak. Niall gestured the servant to leave.
Before the door was fully closed again, Carridin dropped to one knee with a flourish of his
snowy cloak. Behind the sunburst on the cloak’s breast lay the scarlet shepherd’s crook of the Hand
of the Light, called the Questioners by many, though seldom to their faces. “As you have commanded
my presence, my Lord Captain Commander,” he said in a strong voice, “so have I returned from
Tarabon.”
Niall examined him for a moment. Carridin was tall, well into his middle years, with a touch of
gray in his hair, yet fit and hard. His dark, deep-set eyes had a knowing look about them, as always.
And he did not blink under the silent study of the Lord Captain Commander. Few men had
consciences so clear or nerves so steady. Carridin knelt there, waiting as calmly as if it were an
everyday matter to be ordered curtly to leave his command and return to Amador without delay, no
reasons given. But then, it was said Jaichim Carridin could outwait a stone.
“Rise, Child Carridin.” As the other man straightened, Niall added, “I have had disturbing news
from Falme.”
Carridin straightened the folds of his cloak as he answered. His voice rode the edge of suitable
respect, almost as if he spoke to an equal rather than to the man he had sworn to obey to the death.
“My Lord Captain Commander refers to the news brought by Child Jaret Byar, late second to Lord
Captain Bornhald.”
The corner of Niall’s left eye fluttered, an old presage of anger. Supposedly only three men
knew Byar was in Amador, and none besides Niall knew from where he came. “Do not be too clever,
Carridin. Your desire to know everything may one day lead you into the hands of your own
Questioners.”
Carridin showed no reaction beyond a slight tightening of his mouth at the name. “My Lord
Captain Commander, the Hand seeks out truth everywhere, to serve the Light.”
To serve the Light. Not to serve the Children of the Light. All the Children served the Light, but
Pedron Niall often wondered if the Questioners really considered themselves part of the Children at
all. “And what truth do you have for me about what occurred in Falme?”
“Darkfriends, my Lord Captain Commander.”
“Darkfriends?” Niall’s chuckle held no amusement. “A few weeks gone I was receiving reports
from you that Geofram Bornhald was a servant of the Dark One because he moved soldiers onto
Toman Head against your orders.” His voice became dangerously soft. “Do you now mean me to
believe that Bornhald, as a Darkfriend, led a thousand of the Children to their deaths fighting other
Darkfriends?”
“Whether or not he was a Darkfriend will never be known,” Carridin said blandly, “since he

died before he could be put to the question. The Shadow’s plots are murky, and often seem mad to
those who walk in the Light. But that those who seized Falme were Darkfriends, I have no doubt.
Darkfriends and Aes Sedai, in support of a false Dragon. It was the One Power that destroyed
Bornhald and his men, of that I am sure, my Lord Captain Commander, just as it destroyed the armies
that Tarabon and Arad Doman sent against the Darkfriends in Falme.”
“And what of the stories that those who took Falme came from across the Aryth Ocean?”
Carridin shook his head. “My Lord Captain Commander, the people are full of rumors. Some
claim they were the armies Artur Hawkwing sent across the ocean a thousand years ago, come back to
claim the land. Why, some even claim to have seen Hawkwing himself in Falme. And half the heroes
of legend besides. The west is boiling from Tarabon to Saldaea, and a hundred new rumors bubble to
the surface every day, each more outrageous than the last. These so-called Seanchan were no more
than another rabble of Darkfriends gathered to support a false Dragon, only this time with open Aes
Sedai support.”
“What proof have you?” Niall made his voice sound as if he doubted the point. “You have
prisoners?”
“No, my Lord Captain Commander. As Child Byar no doubt told you, Bornhald managed to hurt
them badly enough that they dispersed. And certainly no one we’ve questioned would admit to
supporting a false Dragon. As for proof . . . it lies in two parts. If my Lord Captain Commander will
permit me?”
Niall gestured impatiently.
“The first part is negative. Few ships have tried to cross the Aryth Ocean, and most never
returned. Those that did, turned back before they ran out of food and water. Even the Sea Folk will
not cross the Aryth, and they sail wherever there is trade, even to the lands beyond the Aiel Waste.
My Lord Captain Commander, if there are any lands across the ocean, they are too far to reach, the
ocean too wide. To carry an army across it would be as impossible as flying.”
“Perhaps,” Niall said slowly. “It is certainly indicative. What is your second part?”
“My Lord Captain Commander, many of those we questioned spoke of monsters fighting for the
Darkfriends, and held to their claims even under the last degree of the question. What could they be
but Trollocs and other Shadowspawn, in some way brought down from the Blight?” Carridin spread
his hands as if that were conclusive. “Most people think Trollocs are only travelers’ tales and lies,
and most of the rest think they were all killed in the Trolloc Wars. What other name would they put to
a Trolloc but monster?”
“Yes. Yes, you may be right, Child Carridin. May be, I say.” He would not give Carridin the
satisfaction of knowing he agreed. Let him work awhile. “But what of him?” He indicated the rolled
drawings. If he knew Carridin, the Inquisitor had copies in his own chambers. “How dangerous is he?
Can he channel the One Power?”
The Inquisitor merely shrugged. “Perhaps he can channel, perhaps not. Aes Sedai could no doubt
make people believe a cat could channel, if they wanted to. As to how dangerous he is. . . . Any false
Dragon is dangerous until he is put down, and one with Tar Valon openly behind him is ten times
dangerous. But he is less dangerous now than he will be in half a year, unchecked. The captives I
questioned had never seen him, had no idea where he is now. His forces are fragmented. I doubt there
are more than two hundred gathered in any one place. The Taraboners or the Domani, either one,
could sweep them away if they weren’t so busy fighting each other.”
“Even a false Dragon,” Niall said dryly, “is not enough to make them forget four hundred years
of squabbling over possession of Almoth Plain. As if either of them ever had the strength to hold it.”

Carridin’s face did not change, and Niall wondered how he could keep so calm. You will not be calm
much longer, Questioner.
“It is of no import, my Lord Captain Commander. Winter keeps them all in their camps, except
for scattered skirmishes and raids. When the weather warms enough for troops to move. . . . Bornhald
took only half his legion to their deaths on Toman Head. With the other half, I will hunt this false
Dragon to his death. A corpse is not dangerous to anyone.”
“And if you face what it seems Bornhald faced? Aes Sedai channeling the Power to kill?”
“Their witchery doesn’t protect them from arrows, or a knife in the dark. They die as quickly as
anyone else.” Carridin smiled. “I promise you, I will be successful before summer.”
Niall nodded. The man was confident, now. Sure the dangerous questions would already have
come, if they were coming. You should have remembered, Carridin, I was accounted a fine
tactician. “Why,” he said quietly, “did you not take your own forces to Falme? With Darkfriends on
Toman Head, an army of them holding Falme, why did you try to stop Bornhald?”
Carridin blinked, but his voice remained steady. “At first they were only rumors, my Lord
Captain Commander. Rumors so wild, no one could believe. By the time I learned the truth, Bornhald
had joined battle. He was dead, and the Darkfriends scattered. Besides, my task was to bring the
Light to Almoth Plain. I could not disobey my orders to chase after rumors.”
“Your task?” Niall said, his voice rising as he stood. Carridin topped him by a head, but the
Inquisitor stepped back. “Your task? Your task was to seize Almoth Plain! An empty bucket that no
one holds except by words and claims, and all you had to do was fill it. The nation of Almoth would
have lived again, ruled by the Children of the Light, with no need to pay lip service to a fool of a
king. Amadicia and Almoth, a vise gripping Tarabon. In five years we would have held sway there as
much as here in Amadicia. And you made a dog’s dinner of it!”
The smile went at last. “My Lord Captain Commander,” Carridin protested. “How could I
foresee what happened? Yet another false Dragon. Tarabon and Arad Doman finally going to war
after so long merely growling at each other. And Aes Sedai revealing their true selves after three
thousand years of dissembling! Even with that, though, all is not lost. I can find and destroy this false
Dragon before his followers unite. And once the Taraboners and Domani have weakened themselves,
they can be cleared from the plain without—”
“No!” Niall snapped. “Your plans are done with, Carridin. Perhaps I should hand you over to
your own Questioners right now. The High Inquisitor would not object. He is gnashing his teeth to
find someone to blame for what happened. He would never put forward one of his own, but I doubt
he’d quibble if I named you. A few days under the question, and you would confess to anything. Name
yourself Darkfriend, even. You would go under the headsman’s axe inside a week.”
There was sweat beading on Carridin’s forehead. “My Lord Captain Commander. . . .” He
stopped to swallow. “My Lord Captain Commander seems to be saying there is another way. If he
will but speak it, I am sworn to obey.”
Now, Niall thought. Now to toss the dice. Prickles ran across his skin, as if he were in battle and
had suddenly realized that every man for a hundred paces around him was an enemy. Lord Captain
Commanders did not go to the headsman, but more than one had been known to die suddenly and
unexpectedly, swiftly mourned and swiftly replaced by men with less dangerous ideas.
“Child Carridin,” he said firmly, “you will make certain that this false Dragon does not die. And
if any Aes Sedai come to oppose rather than support him, you will make use of your ‘knives in the
dark.’ ”
The Inquisitor’s jaw dropped. Yet he recovered quickly, eyeing Niall in a speculative fashion.

“To kill Aes Sedai is a duty, but. . . . To allow a false Dragon to roam free? That . . . that would be
. . . treason. And blasphemy.”
Niall drew a deep breath. He could sense the unseen knives waiting in the shadows. But he was
committed, now. “It is no treason to do what must be done. And even blasphemy can be tolerated for
a cause.” Those two sentences alone were enough to kill him. “Do you know how to unite people
behind you, Child Carridin? The quickest way? No? Loose a lion—a rabid lion—in the streets. And
when panic grips the people, once it has turned their bowels to water, calmly tell them you will deal
with it. Then you kill it, and order them to hang the carcass up where everyone can see. Before they
have time to think, you give another order, and it will be obeyed. And if you continue to give orders,
they will continue to obey, for you will be the one who saved them, and who better to lead?”
Carridin moved his head uncertainly. “Do you mean to . . . take it all, my Lord Captain
Commander? Not just Almoth Plain, but Tarabon and Arad Doman as well?”
“What I mean is for me to know. It is for you to obey as you are sworn to do. I expect to hear of
messengers on fast horses leaving for the plain by tonight. I am certain you know how to word the
orders so no one suspects what they should not. If you must harry someone, let it be the Taraboners
and Domani. It would not do to have them kill my lion. No, under the Light, we shall force peace
between them.”
“As my Lord Captain Commander commands,” Carridin said smoothly. “I hear and obey.” Too
smoothly.
Niall smiled a cold smile. “In case your oath is not strong enough, know this. If this false Dragon
dies before I command his death, or if he is taken by the Tar Valon witches, you will be found one
morning with a dagger in your heart. And should any . . . accident . . . befall me—even if I should die
of old age—you will not survive me the month.”
“My Lord Captain Commander, I have sworn to obey—”
“So you have.” Niall cut him off. “See that you remember it. Now, go!”
“As my Lord Captain Commander commands.” This time Carridin’s voice was not so steady.
The door closed behind the Inquisitor. Niall rubbed his hands together. He felt cold. The dice
were spinning, with no way of telling what pips would show when they stopped. The Last Battle truly
was coming. Not the Tarmon Gai’don of legend, with the Dark One breaking free to be faced by the
Dragon Reborn. Not that, he was sure. The Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends might have made a hole
in the Dark One’s prison at Shayol Ghul, but Lews Therin Kinslayer and his Hundred Companions
had sealed it up again. The counterstroke had tainted the male half of the True Source forever and
driven them mad, and so begun the Breaking, but one of those ancient Aes Sedai could do what ten of
the Tar Valon witches of today could not. The seals they had made would hold.
Pedron Niall was a man of cold logic, and he had reasoned out how Tarmon Gai’don would be.
Bestial Trolloc hordes rolling south out of the Great Blight as they had in the Trolloc Wars, two
thousand years before, with the Myrddraal—the Halfmen—leading, and perhaps even new human
Dreadlords from among the Darkfriends. Humankind, split into nations squabbling among themselves,
could not stand against that. But he, Pedron Niall, would unite humankind behind the banners of the
Children of the Light. There would be new legends, to tell how Pedron Niall had fought Tarmon
Gai’don, and won.
“First,” he murmured, “loose a rabid lion in the streets.”
“A rabid lion?”
Niall spun on his heel as a bony little man with a huge beak of a nose slipped from behind one of
the hanging banners. There was just a glimpse of a panel swinging shut as the banner fell back against

the wall.
“I showed you that passage, Ordeith,” Niall snapped, “so you could come when I summoned you
without half the fortress knowing, not so you could listen to my private conversation.”
Ordeith made a smooth bow as he crossed the room. “Listen, Great Lord? I would never do such
a thing. I only just arrived and could not avoid hearing your final words. No more than that.” He wore
a half-mocking smile, but it never left his face that Niall had ever seen, even when the fellow had no
reason to know anyone was watching.
A month before, in the dead of winter, the gangly little man had arrived in Amadicia, ragged and
half-frozen, and somehow managed to talk his way through all the layers of guards to Pedron Niall
himself. He seemed to know things about events on Toman Head that were not in Carridin’s
voluminous if obscure reports, or in Byar’s tale, or in any other report or rumor that had come to
Niall. His name was a lie, of course. In the Old Tongue, Ordeith meant “wormwood.” When Niall
challenged him on it, though, all he said was, “Who we were is lost to all men, and life is bitter.” But
he was clever. It had been he who helped Niall see the pattern emerging in events.
Ordeith moved to the table and took up one of the drawings. As he unrolled it enough to reveal
the young man’s face, his smile deepened to nearly a grimace.
Niall was still irritated that the man had come unsummoned. “You find a false Dragon funny,
Ordeith. Or does he frighten you?”
“A false Dragon?” Ordeith said softly. “Yes. Yes, of course, it must be. Who else could it be.”
And he barked a shrill laugh that grated on Niall’s nerves. Sometimes Niall thought Ordeith was at
least half-mad.
But he is clever, mad or not. “What do you mean, Ordeith? You sound as if you know him.”
Ordeith gave a start, as though he had forgotten the Lord Captain Commander was there. “Know
him? Oh, yes, I know him. His name is Rand al’Thor. He comes from the Two Rivers, in the
backcountry of Andor, and he is a Darkfriend so deep in the Shadow it would make your soul cringe
to know the half.”
“The Two Rivers,” Niall mused. “Someone else mentioned another Darkfriend from there,
another youth. Strange to think of Darkfriends coming from a place like that. But truly they are
everywhere.”
“Another, Great Lord?” Ordeith said. “From the Two Rivers? Would that be Matrim Cauthon or
Perrin Aybara? They are of an age with him, and close behind in evil.”
“His name was given as Perrin,” Niall said, frowning. “Three of them, you say? Nothing comes
out of the Two Rivers but wool and tabac. I doubt if there is another place men live that is more
isolated from the rest of the world.”
“In a city, Darkfriends must hide their nature to one extent or another. They must associate with
others, with strangers come from other places and leaving to take word of what they have seen. But in
quiet villages, cut off from the world, where few outsiders ever go. . . . What better places for all to
be Darkfriends?”
“How is it you know the names of three Darkfriends, Ordeith? Three Darkfriends from the far
end of forever. You keep too many secrets, Wormwood, and pull more surprises from your sleeve
than a gleeman.”
“How can any man tell all that he knows, Great Lord,” the little man said smoothly. “It would be
only prattle, until it becomes useful. I will tell you this, Great Lord. This Rand al’Thor, this Dragon,
has deep roots in the Two Rivers.”
“False Dragon!” Niall said sharply, and the other man bowed.

“Of course, Great Lord. I misspoke myself.”
Suddenly Niall became aware of the drawing crumpled and torn in Ordeith’s hands. Even while
the man’s face remained smooth except for that sardonic smile, his hands twitched convulsively
around the parchment.
“Stop that!” Niall commanded. He snatched the drawing away from Ordeith and smoothed it as
best he could. “I do not have so many likenesses of this man that I can allow them to be destroyed.”
Much of the drawing was only a smudge, and a rip ran across the young man’s breast, but
miraculously the face was untouched.
“Forgive me, Great Lord.” Ordeith made a deep bow, his smile never slipping. “I hate
Darkfriends.”
Niall studied the face in chalks. Rand al’Thor, of the Two Rivers. “Perhaps I must make plans
for the Two Rivers. When the snows clear. Perhaps.”
“As the Great Lord wishes,” Ordeith said blandly.
The grimace on Carridin’s face as he strode through the halls of the Fortress made other men
avoid him, though in truth few sought the company of Questioners. Servants, hurrying about their
tasks, tried to fade into the stone walls, and even men with golden knots of rank on their white cloaks
took side corridors when they saw his face.
He flung open the door to his rooms and slammed it behind him, feeling none of the usual
satisfaction at the fine carpets from Tarabon and Tear in lush reds and golds and blues, the beveled
mirrors from Illian, the gold-leaf work on the long, intricately carved table in the middle of the floor.
A master craftsman from Lugard had worked nearly a year on that. This time he barely saw it.
“Sharbon!” For once his body servant did not appear. The man was supposed to be readying the
rooms. “The Light burn you, Sharbon! Where are you?”
A movement caught the corner of his eye, and he turned ready to shrivel Sharbon with his curses.
The curses themselves shriveled as a Myrddraal took another step toward him with the sinuous grace
of a serpent.
It was a man in form, no larger than most, but there the resemblance ended. Dead black clothes
and cloak, hardly seeming to stir as it moved, made its maggot-white skin appear ever paler. And it
had no eyes. That eyeless gaze filled Carridin with fear, as it had filled thousands before.
“Wha. . . .” Carridin stopped to work moisture back into his mouth, to try bringing his voice
back down to its normal register. “What are you doing here?” It still sounded shrill.
The Halfman’s bloodless lips quirked in a smile. “Where there is shadow, there may I go.” Its
voice sounded like a snake rustling through dead leaves. “I like to keep a watch on all those who
serve me.”
“I ser. . . .”
It was no use. With an effort Carridin jerked his eyes away from that smooth expanse of pale,
pasty face and turned his back. A shiver ran down his spine, having his back to a Myrddraal.
Everything was sharp in the mirror on the wall in front of him. Everything but the Halfman. The
Myrddraal was an indistinct blur. Hardly soothing to look at, but better than meeting that stare. A little
strength returned to Carridin’s voice.
“I serve the. . . .” He cut off, suddenly aware of where he was. In the heart of the Fortress of the
Light. The rumor of a whisper of the words he was about to say would have him given to the Hand of
the Light. The lowest of the Children would strike him down on the spot if he heard. He was alone
except for the Myrddraal, and perhaps Sharbon—Where is that cursed man? It would be good to

have someone to share the Halfman’s stare, even if the other would have to be disposed of afterwards
—but still he lowered his voice. “I serve the Great Lord of the Dark, as you do. We both serve.”
“If you wish to see it so.” The Myrddraal laughed, a sound that made Carridin’s bones shiver.
“Still, I will know why you are here instead of on Almoth Plain.”
“I . . . I was commanded here by word of the Lord Captain Commander.”
The Myrddraal grated, “Your Lord Captain Commander’s words are dung! You were
commanded to find the human called Rand al’Thor and kill him. That before all else. Above all else!
Why are you not obeying?”
Carridin took a deep breath. That gaze on his back felt like a knife blade grating along his spine.
“Things . . . have changed. Some matters are not as much in my control as they were.” A harsh,
scraping noise jerked his head around.
The Myrddraal was drawing a hand across the tabletop, and thin tendrils of wood curled away
from its fingernails. “Nothing has changed, human. You forswore your oaths to the Light and swore
new oaths, and those oaths you will obey.”
Carridin started at the gouges marring the polished wood and swallowed hard. “I don’t
understand. Why is it suddenly so important to kill him? I thought the Great Lord of the Dark meant to
use him.”
“You question me? I should take your tongue. It is not your part to question. Or to understand. It
is your part to obey! You will give dogs lessons in obedience. Do you understand that? Heel, dog,
and obey your master.”
Anger wormed its way through the fear, and Carridin’s hand groped at his side, but his sword
was not there. It lay in the next room now, where he had left it on going to attend Pedron Niall.
The Myrddraal moved faster than a striking viper. Carridin opened his mouth to scream as its
hand closed on his wrist in a crushing grip; bones grated together, sending jolts of agony up his arm.
The scream never left his mouth, though, for the Halfman’s other hand gripped his chin and forced his
jaws shut. His heels rose up, and then his toes left the floor. Grunting and gurgling, he dangled in the
Myrddraal’s grasp.
“Hear me, human. You will find this youth and kill him as quickly as possible. Do not think you
can dissemble. There are others of your children who will tell me if you turn aside in your purpose.
But I will give you this to encourage you. If this Rand al’Thor is not dead in a month, I will take one
of your blood. A son, a daughter, a sister, an uncle. You will not know who until the chosen has died
screaming. If he lives another month, I will take another. And then another, and another. And when
there is no one of your blood living except yourself, if he still lives, I will take you to Shayol Ghul
itself.” It smiled. “You will be years in the dying, human. Do you understand me, now?”
Carridin made a sound, half groan, half whimper. He thought his neck was going to break.
With a snarl, the Myrddraal hurled him across the room. Carridin slammed against the far wall
and slid to the rug, stunned. Facedown, he lay fighting for breath.
“Do you understand me, human?”
“I . . . I hear and obey,” Carridin managed into the carpet. There was no answer.
He turned his head, wincing at the pain in his neck. The room was empty except for him.
Halfmen rode shadows like horses, so the legends said, and when they turned sideways, they
disappeared. No wall could keep them out. Carridin wanted to weep. He levered himself up, cursing
the jolt of pain from his wrist.
The door opened, and Sharbon hurried in, a plump man with a basket in his arms. He stopped to
stare at Carridin. “Master, are you all right? Forgive me for not being here, master, but I went to buy

fruits for your—”
With his good hand Carridin struck the basket from Sharbon’s hands, sending withered winter
apples rolling across the carpets, and backhanded the man across the face.
“Forgive me, master,” Sharbon whispered.
“Fetch me paper and pen and ink,” Carridin snarled. “Hurry, fool! I must send orders.” But
which? Which? As Sharbon scurried to obey, Carridin stared at the gouges in the tabletop and
shivered.

CHAPTER

Waiting

The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend.
Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again. In
one Age, called the Third Age by some, an Age yet to come, an Age long past, a wind rose in the
Mountains of Mist. The wind was not the beginning. There are neither beginnings nor endings to the
turning of the Wheel of Time. But it was a beginning.
Down long valleys the wind swept, valleys blue with morning mist hanging in the air, some
forested with evergreens, some bare where grasses and wildflowers would soon spring up. It howled
across half-buried ruins and broken monuments, all as forgotten as those who had built them. It
moaned in the passes, weatherworn cuts between peaks capped with snow that never melted. Thick
clouds clung to the mountaintops so that snow and white billows seemed one.
In the lowlands winter was going or gone, yet here in the heights it held awhile, quilting the
mountainsides with broad, white patches. Only evergreens clung to leaf or needle; all other branches
stood bare, brown or gray against the rock and not yet quickened ground. There was no sound but the
crisp rush of wind over snow and stone. The land seemed to be waiting. Waiting for something to
burst.
Sitting his horse just inside a thicket of leatherleaf and pine, Perrin Aybara shivered and tugged
his fur-lined cloak closer, as close as he could with a longbow in one hand and a great, half-moon axe
at his belt. It was a good axe of cold steel; Perrin had pumped the bellows the day master Luhhan had
made it. The wind jerked at his cloak, pulling the hood back from his shaggy curls, and cut through his
coat; he wiggled his toes in his boots for warmth and shifted on his high-cantled saddle, but his mind
was not really on the cold. Eyeing his five companions, he wondered if they, too, felt it. Not the
waiting they had been sent there for, but something more.
Stepper, his horse, shifted and tossed his head. He had named the dun stallion for his quick feet,
but now Stepper seemed to feel his rider’s irritation and impatience. I am tired of all this waiting,
all this sitting while Moiraine holds us as tight as tongs. Burn the Aes Sedai! When will it end?
He sniffed the wind without thinking. The smell of horse predominated, and of men and men’s
sweat. A rabbit had gone through those trees not long since, fear powering its run, but the fox on its
trail had not killed there. He realized what he was doing, and stopped it. You’d think I would get a
stuffed nose with all this wind. He almost wished he did have one. And I wouldn’t let Moiraine do
anything about it, either.
Something tickled the back of his mind. He refused to acknowledge it. He did not mention his
feeling to his companions.
The other five men sat their saddles, short horsebows at the ready, eyes searching the sky above
as well as the thinly treed slopes below. They seemed unperturbed by the wind flaring their cloaks

out like banners. A two-handed sword hilt stuck up above each man’s shoulder through a slit in his
cloak. The sight of their bare heads, shaven except for topknots, made Perrin feel colder. For them,
this weather was already well into spring. All softness had been hammered out of them at a harder
forge than he had ever known. They were Shienarans, from the Borderlands up along the Great Blight,
where Trolloc raids could come in any night, and even a merchant or a farmer might well have to take
up sword or bow. And these men were no farmers, but soldiers almost from birth.
He sometimes wondered at the way they deferred to him and followed his lead. It was as if they
thought he had some special right, some knowledge hidden from them. Or maybe it’s just my friends ,
he thought wryly. They were not as tall as he, nor as big—years as a blacksmith’s apprentice had
given him arms and shoulders to make two of most men’s—but he had begun shaving every day to
stop their jokes about his youth. Friendly jokes, but still jokes. He would not have them start again
because he spoke of a feeling.
With a start, Perrin reminded himself that he was supposed to be keeping watch, too. Checking
the arrow nocked to his longbow, he peered down the valley running off to the west, widening as it
fell away, the ground streaked with broad, twisted ribbons of snow, remnants of winter. Most of the
scattered trees down there still clawed the sky with stark winter branches, but enough evergreens—
pine and leatherleaf, fir and mountain holly, even a few towering greenwoods—stood on the slopes
and the valley floor to give cover for anyone who knew how to use it. But no one would be there
without a special purpose. The mines were all far to the south or even further north; most people
thought there was ill luck in the Mountains of Mist, and few entered them who could avoid it. Perrin’s
eyes glittered like burnished gold.
The tickling became an itch. No!
He could push the itch aside, but the expectation would not go. As if he teetered on a brink. As if
everything teetered. He wondered whether something unpleasant lay in the mountains around them.
There was a way to know, perhaps. In places like this, where men seldom came, there were almost
always wolves. He crushed the thought before it had a chance to firm. Better to wonder. Better than
that. Their numbers were not many, but they had scouts. If there was anything out there, the outriders
would find it. This is my forge; I’ll tend it, and let them tend theirs.
He could see further than the others, so he was first to spot the rider coming from the direction of
Tarabon. Even to him the rider was only a spot of bright colors on horseback winding its way through
the trees in the distance, now seen, now hidden. A piebald horse, he thought. And not before time! He
opened his mouth to announce her—it would be a woman; each rider before had been—when
Masema suddenly muttered, “Raven!” like a curse.
Perrin jerked his head up. A big black bird was quartering over the treetops no more than a
hundred paces away. Its quarry might have been carrion dead in the snow or some small animal, yet
Perrin could not take the chance. It did not seem to have seen them, but the oncoming rider would
soon be in its sight. Even as he spotted the raven, his bow came up, and he drew—fletchings to cheek,
to ear—and loosed, all in one smooth motion. He was dimly aware of the slap of bowstrings beside
him, but his attention was all on the black bird.
Of a sudden it cartwheeled in a shower of midnight feathers as his arrow found it, and tumbled
from the sky as two more arrows streaked through the place where it had been. Bows half-drawn, the
other Shienarans searched the sky to see if it had a companion.
“Does it have to report,” Perrin asked softly, “or does . . . he . . . see what it sees?” He had not
meant anyone to hear, but Ragan, the youngest of the Shienarans, less than ten years his elder,
answered as he fitted another arrow to his short bow.

“It has to report. To a Halfman, usually.” In the Borderlands there was a bounty on ravens; no
one there ever dared assume any raven was just a bird. “Light, if Heartsbane saw what the ravens
saw, we would all have been dead before we reached the mountains.” Ragan’s voice was easy; it
was a matter of every day to a Shienaran soldier.
Perrin shivered, not from the cold, and in the back of his head something snarled a challenge to
the death. Heartsbane. Different names in different lands—Soulsbane and Heartfang, Lord of the
Grave and Lord of the Twilight—and everywhere Father of Lies and the Dark One, all to avoid
giving him his true name and drawing his attention. The Dark One often used ravens and crows, rats
in the cities. Perrin drew another broadhead arrow from the quiver on his hip that balanced the axe on
the other side.
“That may be as big as a club,” Ragan said admiringly, with a glance at Perrin’s bow, “but it can
shoot. I would hate to see what it could do to a man in armor.” The Shienarans wore only light mail,
now, under their plain coats, but usually they fought in armor, man and horse alike.
“Too long for horseback,” Masema sneered. The triangular scar on his dark cheek twisted his
contemptuous grin even more. “A good breastplate will stop even a pile arrow except at close range,
and if your first shot fails, the man you’re shooting at will carve your guts out.”
“That is just it, Masema.” Ragan relaxed a bit as the sky remained empty. The raven must have
been alone. “With this Two Rivers bow, I’ll wager you don’t have to be so close.” Masema opened
his mouth.
“You two stop flapping your bloody tongues!” Uno snapped. With a long scar down the left side
of his face and that eye gone, his features were hard, even for a Shienaran. He had acquired a painted
eyepatch on their way into the mountains during the autumn; a permanently frowning eye in a fiery red
did nothing to make his stare easier to face. “If you can’t keep your bloody minds on the bloody task
at hand, I’ll see if extra flaming guard duty tonight will bloody settle you.” Ragan and Masema
subsided under his stare. He gave them a last scowl that faded as he turned to Perrin. “Do you see
anything yet?” His tone was a little gruffer than he might have used with a commander put over him by
the King of Shienar, or the Lord of Fal Dara, yet there was something in it of readiness to do
whatever Perrin suggested.
The Shienarans knew how far he could see, but they seemed to take it as a matter of course, that
and the color of his eyes, as well. They did not know everything, not by half, but they accepted him as
he was. As they thought he was. They seemed to accept everything and anything. The world was
changing, they said. Everything spun on the wheels of chance and change. If a man had eyes a color no
man’s eyes had ever been, what did it matter, now?
“She’s coming,” Perrin said. “You should just see her now. There.” He pointed, and Uno
strained forward, his one real eye squinting, then finally nodded doubtfully.
“There’s bloody something moving down there.” Some of the others nodded and murmured, too.
Uno glared at them, and they went back to studying the sky and the mountains.
Suddenly Perrin realized what the bright colors on the distant rider meant. A vivid green skirt
peeking out beneath a bright red cloak. “She’s one of the Traveling People,” he said, startled. No one
else he had ever heard of dressed in such brilliant colors and odd combinations, not by choice.
The women they had sometimes met and guided even deeper into the mountains included every
sort: a beggar woman in rags struggling afoot through a snowstorm; a merchant by herself leading a
string of laden packhorses; a lady in silks and fine furs, with red-tasseled reins on her palfrey and
gold worked on her saddle. The beggar departed with a purse of silver—more than Perrin thought
they could afford to give, until the lady left an even fatter purse of gold. Women from every station in

life, all alone, from Tarabon, and Ghealdan, and even Amadicia. But he had never expected to see
one of the Tuatha’an.
“A bloody Tinker?” Uno exclaimed. The others echoed his surprise.
Ragan’s topknot waved as he shook his head. “A Tinker wouldn’t be mixed in this. Either she’s
not a Tinker, or she is not the one we are supposed to meet.”
“Tinkers,” Masema growled. “Useless cowards.”
Uno’s eye narrowed until it looked like the pritchel hole of an anvil; with the red painted eye on
his patch, it gave him a villainous look. “Cowards, Masema?” he said softly. “If you were a woman,
would you have the flaming nerve to ride up here, alone and bloody unarmed?” There was no doubt
she would be unarmed if she was of the Tuatha’an. Masema kept his mouth shut, but the scar on his
cheek stood out tight and pale.
“Burn me, if I would,” Ragan said. “And burn me if you would either, Masema.” Masema
hitched at his cloak and ostentatiously searched the sky.
Uno snorted. “The Light send that flaming carrion eater was flaming alone,” he muttered.
Slowly the shaggy brown-and-white mare meandered closer, picking a way along the clear
ground between broad snowbanks. Once the brightly clad woman stopped to peer at something on the
ground, then tugged the cowl of her cloak further over her head and heeled her mount forward in a
slow walk. The raven, Perrin thought. Stop looking at that bird and come on, woman. Maybe you’ve
brought the word that finally takes us out of here. If Moiraine means to let us leave before spring.
Burn her! For a moment he was not sure whether he meant the Aes Sedai, or the Tinker woman who
seemed to be taking her own time.
If she kept on as she was, the woman would pass a good thirty paces to one side of the thicket.
With her eyes fixed on where her piebald stepped, she gave no sign that she had seen them among the
trees.
Perrin nudged the stallion’s flanks with his heels, and the dun leaped ahead, sending up sprays of
snow with his hooves. Behind him, Uno quietly gave the command, “Forward!”
Stepper was halfway to her before she seemed to become aware of them, and then she jerked her
mare to a halt with a start. She watched as they formed an arc centered on her. Embroidery of eyewrenching blue, in the pattern called a Tairen maze, made her red cloak even more garish. She was
not young—gray showed thick in her hair where it was not hidden by her cowl—but her face had few
lines, other than the disapproving frown she ran over their weapons. If she was alarmed at meeting
armed men in the heart of mountain wilderness, though, she gave no sign. Her hands rested easily on
the high pommel of her worn but well-kept saddle. And she did not smell afraid.
Stop that! Perrin told himself. He made his voice soft so as not to frighten her. “My name is
Perrin, good mistress. If you need help, I will do what I can. If not, go with the Light. But unless the
Tuatha’an have changed their ways, you are far from your wagons.”
She studied them a moment more before speaking. There was a gentleness in her dark eyes, not
surprising in one of the Traveling People. “I seek an . . . a woman.”
The skip was small, but it was there. She sought not any woman, but an Aes Sedai. “Does she
have a name, good mistress?” Perrin asked. He had done this too many times in the last few months to
need her reply, but iron was spoiled for want of care.
“She is called. . . . Sometimes, she is called Moiraine. My name is Leya.”
Perrin nodded. “We will take you to her, Mistress Leya. We have warm fires, and with luck
something hot to eat.” But he did not lift his reins immediately. “How did you find us?” He had asked
before, each time Moiraine sent him out to wait at a spot she named, for a woman she knew would

come. The answer would be the same as it always was, but he had to ask.
Leya shrugged and answered hesitantly. “I . . . knew that if I came this way, someone would find
me and take me to her. I . . . just . . . knew. I have news for her.”
Perrin did not ask what news. The women gave the information they brought only to Moiraine.
And the Aes Sedai tells us what she chooses. He thought. Aes Sedai never lied, but it was said
that the truth an Aes Sedai told you was not always the truth you thought it was. Too late for qualms,
now. Isn’t it?
“This way, Mistress Leya,” he said, gesturing up the mountain. The Shienarans, with Uno at their
head, fell in behind Perrin and Leya as they began to climb. The Borderlanders still studied the sky as
much as the land, and the last two kept a special watch on their backtrail.
For a time they rode in silence except for the sounds the horses’ hooves made, sometimes
crunching through old snowcrust, sometimes sending rocks clattering as they crossed bare stretches.
Now and again Leya cast glances at Perrin, at his bow, his axe, his face, but she did not speak. He
shifted uncomfortably under the scrutiny, and avoided looking at her. He always tried to give
strangers as little chance to notice his eyes as he could manage.
Finally he said, “I was surprised to see one of the Traveling People, believing as you do.”
“It is possible to oppose evil without doing violence.” Her voice held the simplicity of someone
stating an obvious truth.
Perrin grunted sourly, then immediately muttered an apology. “Would it were as you say,
Mistress Leya.”
“Violence harms the doer as much as the victim,” Leya said placidly. “That is why we flee those
who harm us, to save them from harm to themselves as much for our own safety. If we do violence to
oppose evil, soon we would be no different from what we struggle against. It is with the strength of
our belief that we fight the Shadow.”
Perrin could not help snorting. “Mistress, I hope you never have to face Trollocs with the
strength of your belief. The strength of their swords will cut you down where you stand.”
“It is better to die than to—” she began, but anger made him speak right over her. Anger that she
just would not see. Anger that she really would die rather than harm anyone, no matter how evil.
“If you run, they will hunt you, and kill you, and eat your corpse. Or they might not wait till it is a
corpse. Either way, you are dead, and it’s evil that has won. And there are men just as cruel.
Darkfriends and others. More others than I would have believed even a year ago. Let the Whitecloaks decide you Tinkers don’t walk in the Light and see how many of you the strength of your belief
can keep alive.”
She gave him a penetrating look. “And yet you are not happy with your weapons.”
How did she know that? He shook his head irritably, shaggy hair swaying. “The Creator made
the world,” he muttered, “not I. I must live the best I can in the world the way it is.”
“So sad for one so young,” she said softly. “Why so sad?”
“I should be watching, not talking,” he said curtly. “You won’t thank me if I get you lost.” He
heeled Stepper forward enough to cut off any further conversation, but he could feel her looking at
him. Sad? I’m not sad, just. . . . Light, I don’t know. There ought to be a better way, that’s all. The
itching tickle came again at the back of his head, but absorbed in ignoring Leya’s eyes on his back, he
ignored that, too.
Over the slope of the mountain and down they rode, across a forested valley with a broad stream
running cold along its bottom, knee-deep on the horses. In the distance, the side of a mountain had
been carved into the semblance of two towering forms. A man and a woman, Perrin thought they might

be, though wind and rain had long since made that uncertain. Even Moiraine claimed to be unsure
who they were supposed to be, or when the granite had been cut.
Pricklebacks and small trout darted away from the horses’ hooves, silver flashes in the clear
water. A deer raised its head from browsing, hesitated as the party rode up out of the stream, then
bounded off into the trees, and a large mountain cat, gray striped and spotted with black, seemed to
rise out of the ground, frustrated in its stalk. It eyed the horses a moment, and with a lash of its tail
vanished after the deer. But there was little life visible in the mountains yet. Only a handful of birds
perched on limbs or pecked at the ground where the snow had melted. More would return to the
heights in a few weeks, but not yet. They saw no other ravens.
It was late afternoon by the time Perrin led them between two steep-sloped mountains, snowy
peaks as ever wrapped in cloud, and turned up a smaller stream that splashed downward over gray
stones in a series of tiny waterfalls. A bird called in the trees, and another answered it from ahead.
Perrin smiled. Bluefinch calls. A Borderland bird. No one rode this way without being seen. He
rubbed his nose, and did not look at the tree the first “bird” had called from.
Their path narrowed as they rode up through scrubby leatherleaf and a few gnarled mountain
oaks. The ground level enough to ride beside the stream became barely wider than a man on
horseback, and the stream itself no more than a tall man could step across.
Perrin heard Leya behind him, murmuring to herself. When he looked over his shoulder, she was
casting worried glances up the steep slopes to either side. Scattered trees perched precariously above
them. It appeared impossible they would not fall. The Shienarans rode easily, at last beginning to
relax.
Abruptly a deep, oval bowl between the mountains opened out before them, its sides steep but
not nearly so precipitous as the narrow passage. The stream rose from a small spring at its far end.
Perrin’s sharp eyes picked out a man with the topknot of a Shienaran, up in the limbs of an oak to his
left. Had a redwinged jay called instead of a bluefinch, he would not have been alone, and the way in
would not have been so easy. A handful of men could hold that passage against an army. If an army
came, a handful would have to.
Among the trees around the bowl stood log huts, not readily visible, so that those gathered
around the cook fires at the bottom of the bowl seemed at first to be without shelter. There were
fewer than a dozen in sight. And not many more out of sight, Perrin knew. Most of them looked around
at the sound of horses, and some waved. The bowl seemed filled with the smells of men and horses,
of cooking and burning wood. A long white banner hung limply from a tall pole near them. One form,
at least half again as tall as anyone else, sat on a log engrossed in a book that was small in his huge
hands. That one’s attention never wavered, even when the only other person without a topknot
shouted, “So you found her, did you? I thought you’d be gone the night, this time.” It was a young
woman’s voice, but she wore a boy’s coat and breeches and had her hair cut short.
A burst of wind swirled into the bowl, making cloaks flap and rippling the banner out to its full
length. For a moment the creature on it seemed to ride the wind. A four-legged serpent scaled in gold
and scarlet, golden maned like a lion, and its feet each tipped with five golden claws. A banner of
legend. A banner most men would not know if they saw it, but would fear when they learned its name.
Perrin waved a hand that took it all in as he led the way down into the bowl. “Welcome to the
camp of the Dragon Reborn, Leya.”

CHAPTER

Saidin

Face expressionless, the Tuatha’an woman stared at the banner as it drooped again, then turned
her attention to those around the fire. Especially the one reading, the one half again as tall as Perrin
and twice as big. “You have an Ogier with you. I would not have thought. . . .”She shook her head.
“Where is Moiraine Sedai?” It seemed the Dragon banner might as well not exist as far as she was
concerned.
Perrin gestured toward the rough hut that stood furthest up the slope, at the far end of the bowl.
With walls and sloping roof of unpeeled logs, it was the largest, though not very big at that. Perhaps
just barely large enough to be called a cabin rather than a hut. “That one is hers. Hers and Lan’s. He
is her Warder. When you have had something hot to drink—”
“No. I must speak to Moiraine.”
He was not surprised. All the women who came insisted on speaking to Moiraine immediately,
and alone. The news that Moiraine chose to share with the rest of them did not always seem very
important, but the women held the intensity of a hunter stalking the last rabbit in the world for his
starving family. The half-frozen old beggar woman had refused blankets and a plate of hot stew and
tramped up to Moiraine’s hut, barefoot in still-falling snow.
Leya slid from her saddle and handed the reins up to Perrin. “Will you see that she is fed?” She
patted the piebald mare’s nose. “Piesa is not used to carrying me over such rugged country.”
“Fodder is scarce, still,” Perrin told her, “but she’ll have what we can give her.”
Leya nodded, and went hurrying away up the slope without another word, holding her bright
green skirts up, the blue-embroidered red cloak swaying behind her.
Perrin swung down from his saddle, exchanging a few words with the men who came from the
fires to take the horses. He gave his bow to the one who took Stepper. No, except for one raven, they
had seen nothing but the mountains and the Tuatha’an woman. Yes, the raven was dead. No, she had
told them nothing of what was happening outside the mountains. No, he had no idea whether they
would be leaving soon.
Or ever, he added to himself. Moiraine had kept them there all winter. The Shienarans did not
think she gave the orders, not here, but Perrin knew that Aes Sedai somehow always seemed to get
their way. Especially Moiraine.
Once the horses were led away to the rude log stable, the riders went to warm themselves.
Perrin tossed his cloak back over his shoulders and held his hands out to the flames gratefully. The
big kettle, Baerlon work by the look of it, gave off smells that had been making his mouth water for
some time already. Someone had been lucky hunting today, it seemed, and lumpy roots circled another
fire close by, giving off an aroma faintly like turnips as they roasted. He wrinkled his nose and
concentrated on the stew. More and more he wanted meat above anything else.

The woman in men’s clothes was peering toward Leya, who was just disappearing into
Moiraine’s hut.
“What do you see, Min?” he asked.
She came to stand beside him, her dark eyes troubled. He did not understand why she insisted on
breeches instead of skirts. Perhaps it was because he knew her, but he could not see how anyone
could look at her and see a too-handsome youth instead of a pretty young woman.
“The Tinker woman is going to die,” she said softly, eyeing the others near the fires. None was
close enough to hear.
He was still, thinking of Leya’s gentle face. Ah, Light! Tinkers never harm anyone! He felt cold
despite the warmth of the fire. Burn me, I wish I’d never asked. Even the few Aes Sedai who knew
of it did not understand what Min did. Sometimes she saw images and auras surrounding people, and
sometimes she even knew what they meant.
Masuto came to stir the stew with a long wood spoon. The Shienaran eyed them, then laid a
finger alongside his long nose and grinned widely before he left.
“Blood and ashes!” Min muttered. “He’s probably decided we are sweethearts murmuring to
each other by the fire.”
“Are you sure?” Perrin asked. She raised her eyebrows at him, and he hastily added, “About
Leya.”
“Is that her name? I wish I didn’t know. It always makes it worse, knowing and not being able to.
. . . Perrin, I saw her own face floating over her shoulder, covered in blood, eyes staring. It’s never
any clearer than that.” She shivered and rubbed her hands together briskly. “Light, but I wish I saw
more happy things. All the happy things seem to have gone away.”
He opened his mouth to suggest warning Leya, then closed it again. There was never any doubt
about what Min saw and knew, for good or bad. If she was certain, it happened.
“Blood on her face,” he muttered. “Does that mean she’ll die by violence?” He winced that he
said it so easily. But what can I do? If I tell Leya, if I make her believe somehow, she’ll live her
last days in fear, and it will change nothing.
Min gave a short nod.
If she’s going to die by violence, it could mean an attack on the camp. But there were scouts
out every day, and guards set day and night. And Moiraine had the camp warded, so she said; no
creature of the Dark One would see it unless he walked right into it. He thought of the wolves. No!
The scouts would find anyone or anything trying to approach the camp. “It’s a long way back to her
people,” he said half to himself. “Tinkers wouldn’t have brought their wagons any further than the
foothills. Anything could happen between here and there.”
Min nodded sadly. “And there aren’t enough of us to spare even one guard for her. Even if it
would do any good.”
She had told him; she had tried warning people about bad things when, at six or seven, she had
first realized not everyone could see what she saw. She would not say more, but he had the
impression that her warnings had only made matters worse, when they were believed at all. It took
some doing to believe in Min’s viewings until you had proof.
“When?” he said. The word was cold in his ears, and hard as tool steel. I can’t do anything
about Leya, but maybe I can figure out whether we’re going to be attacked.
As soon as the word was out of his mouth, she threw up her hands. She kept her voice down,
though. “It isn’t like that. I can never tell when something is going to happen. I only know it will, if I
even know what I see means. You don’t understand. The seeing doesn’t come when I want it to, and

neither does knowing. It just happens, and sometimes I know. Something. A little bit. It just happens.”
He tried to get a soothing word in, but she was letting it all out in a flood he could not stem. “I can see
things around a man one day and not the next, or the other way ’round. Most of the time, I don’t see
anything around anyone. Aes Sedai always have images around them, of course, and Warders, though
it’s always harder to say what it means with them than with anyone else.” She gave Perrin a searching
look, half squinting. “A few others always do, too.”
“Don’t tell me what you see when you look at me,” he said harshly, then shrugged his heavy
shoulders. Even as a child he had been bigger than most of the others, and he had quickly learned how
easy it was to hurt people by accident when you were bigger than they. It had made him cautious and
careful, and regretful of his anger when he let it show. “I am sorry, Min. I shouldn’t have snapped at
you. I did not mean to hurt you.”
She gave him a surprised look. “You didn’t hurt me. Blessed few people want to know what I
see. The Light knows, I would not, if it were someone else who could do it.” Even the Aes Sedai had
never heard of anyone else who had her gift. “Gift” was how they saw it, even if she did not.
“It’s just that I wish there were something I could do about Leya. I couldn’t stand it the way you
do, knowing and not able to do anything.”
“Strange,” she said softly, “how you seem to care so much about the Tuatha’an. They are utterly
peaceful, and I always see violence around—”
He turned his head away, and she cut off abruptly.
“Tuatha’an?” came a rumbling voice, like a huge bumblebee. “What about the Tuatha’an?” The
Ogier came to join them at the fire, marking his place in his book with a finger the size of a large
sausage. A thin streamer of tabac smoke rose from the pipe in his other hand. His high-necked coat of
dark brown wool buttoned up to the neck, and flared at the knee over turned-down boot tops. Perrin
stood hardly as high as his chest.
Loial’s face had frightened more than one person, with his nose broad enough almost to be
called a snout and his too-wide mouth. His eyes were the size of saucers, with thick eyebrows that
dangled like mustaches almost to his cheeks, and his ears poked up through long hair in tufted points.
Some who had never seen an Ogier took him for a Trolloc, though Trollocs were as much legend to
most of them as Ogier.
Loial’s wide smile wavered and his eyes blinked as he became aware of having interrupted
them. Perrin wondered how anyone could be frightened of the Ogier for long. Yet some of the old
stories call them fierce, and implacable as enemies. He could not believe it. Ogier were enemies to
no one.
Min told Loial of Leya’s arrival, but not of what she had seen. She was usually closemouthed
about those seeings, especially when they were bad. Instead, she added, “You should know how I
feel, Loial, suddenly caught up by Aes Sedai and these Two Rivers folk.”
Loial made a noncommittal sound, but Min seemed to take it for agreement.
“Yes,” she said emphatically. “There I was, living my life in Baerlon as I liked it, when
suddenly I was grabbed up by the scruff of the neck and jerked off to the Light knows where. Well, I
might as well have been. My life has not been my own since I met Moiraine. And these Two Rivers
farmboys.” She rolled her eyes at Perrin, a wry twist to her mouth. “All I wanted was to live as I
pleased, fall in love with a man I chose. . . .” Her cheeks reddened suddenly, and she cleared her
throat. “I mean to say, what is wrong with wanting to live your life without all this upheaval?”
“Ta’veren,” Loial began. Perrin waved at him to stop, but the Ogier could seldom be slowed,
much less stopped, when one of his enthusiasms had him in its grip. He was accounted extremely

hasty, by the Ogier way of looking at things. Loial pushed his book into a coat pocket and went on,
gesturing with his pipe. “All of us, all of our lives, affect the lives of others, Min. As the Wheel of
Time weaves us into the Pattern, the life-thread of each of us pulls and tugs at the life-threads around
us. Ta’veren are the same, only much, much more so. They tug at the entire Pattern—for a time, at
least—forcing it to shape around them. The closer you are to them, the more you are affected
personally. It’s said that if you were in the same room with Artur Hawkwing, you could feel the
Pattern rearranging itself. I don’t know how true that is, but I’ve read that it was. But it doesn’t only
work one way. Ta’veren themselves are woven to a tighter line than the rest of us, with fewer
choices.”
Perrin grimaced. Bloody few of the ones that matter.
Min tossed her head. “I just wish they didn’t have to be so . . . so bloody ta’veren all the time.
Ta’veren tugging on one side, and Aes Sedai meddling on the other. What chance does a woman
have?”
Loial shrugged. “Very little, I suppose, as long as she stays close to ta’veren.”
“As if I had a choice,” Min growled.
“It was your good fortune—or misfortune, if you see it that way—to fall in with not one, but
three ta’veren. Rand, Mat, and Perrin. I myself count it very good fortune, and would even if they
weren’t my friends. I think I might even. . . .” The Ogier looked at them, suddenly shy, his ears
twitching. “Promise you will not laugh? I think I might write a book about it. I have been taking
notes.”
Min smiled, a friendly smile, and Loial’s ears pricked back up again. “That’s wonderful,” she
told him. “But some of us feel as if we’re being danced about like puppets by these ta’veren.”
“I didn’t ask for it,” Perrin burst out. “I did not ask for it.”
She ignored him. “Is that what happened to you, Loial? Is that why you travel with Moiraine? I
know you Ogier almost never leave your stedding. Did one of these ta’veren tug you along with
him?”
Loial became engrossed in a study of his pipe. “I just wanted to see the groves the Ogier
planted,” he muttered. “Just to see the groves.” He glanced at Perrin as if asking for help, but Perrin
only grinned.
Let’s see how the shoe nails onto your hoof. He did not know all of it, but he did know Loial
had run away. He was ninety years old, but not yet old enough by Ogier standards to leave the
stedding—going Outside, they called it—without the permission of the Elders. Ogier lived a very
long time, as humans saw things. Loial said the Elders would not be best pleased when they put their
hands on him again. He seemed intent on putting that moment off as long as possible.
There was a stir among the Shienarans, men getting to their feet. Rand was coming out of
Moiraine’s hut.
Even at that distance Perrin could make him out clearly, a young man with reddish hair and gray
eyes. He was of an age with Perrin, and would stand half a head taller if they were side by side,
though Rand was more slender, if still broad across the shoulders. Embroidered golden thorns ran up
the sleeves of his high-collared, red coat, and on the breast of his dark cloak stood the same creature
as on the banner, the four-legged serpent with the golden mane. Rand and he had grown up together as
friends. Are we still friends? Can we be? Now?
The Shienarans bowed as one, heads held up but hands to knees. “Lord Dragon,” Uno called,
“we stand ready. Honor to serve.”
Uno, who could hardly say a sentence without a curse, spoke now with the deepest respect. The

others echoed him. “Honor to serve.” Masema, who saw ill in everything, and whose eyes now shone
with utter devotion; Ragan; all of them, awaiting a command if it were Rand’s pleasure to give one.
From the slope Rand stared down at them a moment, then turned and disappeared into the trees.
“He has been arguing with Moiraine again,” Min said quietly. “All day, this time.”
Perrin was not surprised, yet he still felt a small shock. Arguing with an Aes Sedai. All the
childhood tales came back to him. Aes Sedai, who made thrones and nations dance to their hidden
strings. Aes Sedai, whose gift always had a hook in it, whose price was always smaller than you
could believe, yet always turned out to be greater than you could imagine. Aes Sedai, whose anger
could break the ground and summon lightning. Some of the stories were untrue, he knew now. And at
the same time, they did not tell the half.
“I had better go to him,” he said. “After they argue, he always needs someone to talk to.” And
aside from Moiraine and Lan, there were only the three of them—Min, Loial, and him—who did not
stare at Rand as if he stood above kings. And of the three only Perrin knew him from before.
He strode up the slope, pausing only to glance at the closed door of Moiraine’s hut. Leya would
be in there, and Lan. The Warder seldom let himself get far from the Aes Sedai’s side.
Rand’s much smaller hut was a little lower down, well hidden in the trees, away from all the
rest. He had tried living down among the other men, but their constant awe drove him off. He kept to
himself, now. Too much to himself, to Perrin’s thinking. But he knew Rand was not headed to his hut
now.
Perrin hurried on to where one side of the bowl-shaped valley suddenly became sheer cliff, fifty
paces high and smooth except for tough brush clinging tenaciously here and there. He knew exactly
where a crack in the gray rock wall lay, an opening hardly wider than his shoulders. With only a
ribbon of late-afternoon light overhead, it was like walking down a tunnel.
Half a mile the crack ran, abruptly opening out into a narrow vale, less than a mile long, its floor
covered with rocks and boulders, and even the steep slopes were thickly forested with tall leatherleaf
and pine and fir. Long shadows stretched away from the sun sitting on the mountaintops. The walls of
this place were unbroken save for the crack, and as steep as if a giant axe had buried itself in the
mountains. It could be even more easily defended by a few than the bowl, but it had neither stream nor
spring. No one went there. Except Rand, after he argued with Moiraine.
Rand stood not far from the entrance, leaning against the rough trunk of a leatherleaf, staring at
the palms of his hands. Perrin knew that on each there was a heron, branded into the flesh. Rand did
not move when Perrin’s boot scraped on stone.
Suddenly Rand began to recite softly, never looking up from his hands.
“Twice and twice shall he be marked,
twice to live, and twice to die.
Once the heron, to set his path.
Twice the heron, to name him true.
Once the Dragon, for remembrance lost.
Twice the Dragon, for the price he must pay.”
With a shudder he tucked his hands under his arms. “But no Dragons, yet.” He chuckled roughly.
“Not yet.”
For a moment Perrin simply looked at him. A man who could channel the One Power. A man
doomed to go mad from the taint on saidin, the male half of the True Source, and certain to destroy
everything around him in his madness. A man—a thing!—everyone was taught to loathe and fear from

childhood. Only . . . it was hard to stop seeing the boy he had grown up with. How do you just stop
being somebody’s friend? Perrin chose a small boulder with a flat top, and sat, waiting.
After a while Rand turned his head to look at him. “Do you think Mat is all right? He looked so
sick, the last I saw him.”
“He must be all right by now.” He should be in Tar Valon, by now. They’ll Heal him, there.
And Nynaeve and Egwene will keep him out of trouble. Egwene and Nynaeve, Rand and Mat and
Perrin. All five from Emond’s Field in the Two Rivers. Few people had come into the Two Rivers
from outside, except for occasional peddlers, and merchants once a year to buy wool and tabac.
Almost no one had ever left. Until the Wheel chose out its ta’veren, and five simple country folk
could stay where they were no longer. Could be what they had been no longer.
Rand nodded and was silent.
“Lately,” Perrin said, “I find myself wishing I was still a blacksmith. Do you. . . . Do you wish
you were still just a shepherd?”
“Duty,” Rand muttered. “Death is lighter than a feather, duty heavier than a mountain. That’s
what they say in Shienar. ‘The Dark One is stirring. The Last Battle is coming. And the Dragon
Reborn has to face the Dark One in the Last Battle, or the Shadow will cover everything. The Wheel
of Time broken. Every Age remade in the Dark One’s image.’ There’s only me.” He began to laugh
mirthlessly, his shoulders shaking. “I have the duty, because there isn’t anybody else, now is there?”
Perrin shifted uneasily. The laughter had a raw edge that made his skin crawl. “I understand you
were arguing with Moiraine again. The same thing?”
Rand drew a deep, ragged breath. “Don’t we always argue about the same thing? They’re down
there, on Almoth Plain, and the Light alone knows where else. Hundreds of them. Thousands. They
declared for the Dragon Reborn because I raised that banner. Because I let myself be called the
Dragon. Because I could see no other choice. And they’re dying. Fighting, searching, and praying for
the man who is supposed to lead them. Dying. And I sit here safe in the mountains all winter. I . . . I
owe them . . . something.”
“You think I like it?” Perrin swung his head in irritation.
“You take whatever she says to you,” Rand grated. “You never stand up to her.”
“Much good it has done you, standing up to her. You have argued all winter, and we have sat
here like lumps all winter.”
“Because she is right.” Rand laughed again, that chilling laugh. “The Light burn me, she is right.
They are all split up into little groups all over the plain, all across Tarabon and Arad Doman. If I join
any one of them, the Whitecloaks and the Domani army and the Taraboners will be on top of them like
a duck on a beetle.”
Perrin almost laughed himself, in confusion. “If you agree with her, why in the Light do you
argue all the time?”
“Because I have to do something. Or I’ll . . . I’ll—burst like a rotted melon!”
“Do what? If you listen to what she says—”
Rand gave him no chance to say they would sit there forever. “Moiraine says! Moiraine says!”
Rand jerked erect, squeezing his head between his hands. “Moiraine has something to say about
everything! Moiraine says I mustn’t go to the men who are dying in my name. Moiraine says I’ll know
what to do next because the Pattern will force me to it. Moiraine says! But she never says how I’ll
know. Oh, no! She doesn’t know that.” His hands fell to his sides, and he turned toward Perrin, head
tilted and eyes narrowed. “Sometimes I feel as if Moiraine is putting me through my paces like a
fancy Tairen stallion doing his steps. Do you ever feel that?”

Perrin scrubbed a hand through his shaggy hair. “I. . . . Whatever is pushing us, or pulling us, I
know who the enemy is, Rand.”
“Ba’alzamon,” Rand said softly. An ancient name for the Dark One. In the Trolloc tongue, it
meant Heart of the Dark. “And I must face him, Perrin.” His eyes closed in a grimace, half smile, half
pain. “Light help me, half the time I want it to happen now, to be over and done with, and the other
half. . . . How many times can I manage to. . . . Light, it pulls at me so. What if I can’t. . . . What if I.
. . .” The ground trembled.
“Rand?” Perrin said worriedly.
Rand shivered; despite the chill, there was sweat on his face. His eyes were still shut tight. “Oh,
Light,” he groaned, “it pulls so.”
Suddenly the ground heaved beneath Perrin, and the valley echoed with a vast rumble. It seemed
as if the ground was jerked out from under his feet. He fell—or the earth leaped up to meet him. The
valley shook as though a vast hand had reached down from the sky to wrench it out of the land. He
clung to the ground while it tried to bounce him like a ball. Pebbles in front of his eyes leaped and
tumbled, and dust rose in waves.
“Rand!” His bellow was lost in the grumbling roar.
Rand stood with his head thrown back, his eyes still shut tight. He did not seem to feel the
thrashing of the ground that had him now at one angle, now at another. His balance never shifted, no
matter how he was tossed. Perrin could not be certain, being shaken as he was, but he thought Rand
wore a sad smile. The trees flailed about, and the leatherleaf suddenly cracked in two, the greater
part of its trunk crashing down not three paces from Rand. He noticed it no more than he noticed any
of the rest.
Perrin struggled to fill his lungs. “Rand! For the love of the Light, Rand! Stop it!”
As abruptly as it had begun, it was done. A weakened branch cracked off of a stunted oak with a
loud snap. Perrin got to his feet slowly, coughing. Dust hung in the air, sparkling motes in the rays of
the setting sun.
Rand was staring at nothing, now, chest heaving as if he had run ten miles. This had never
happened before, nor anything remotely like it.
“Rand,” Perrin said carefully, “what—?”
Rand still seemed to be looking into a far distance. “It is always there. Calling to me. Pulling at
me. Saidin. The male half of the True Source. Sometimes I can’t stop myself from reaching out for it.”
He made a motion of plucking something out of the air, and transferred his stare to his closed fist. “I
can feel the taint even before I touch it. The Dark One’s taint, like a thin coat of vileness trying to hide
the Light. It turns my stomach, but I cannot help myself. I cannot! Only sometimes, I reach out, and it’s
like trying to catch air.” His empty hand sprang open, and he gave a bitter laugh. “What if that
happens when the Last Battle comes? What if I reach out and catch nothing?”
“Well, you caught something that time,” Perrin said hoarsely. “What were you doing?”
Rand looked around as if seeing things for the first time. The fallen leatherleaf, and the broken
branches. There was, Perrin realized, surprisingly little damage. He had expected gaping rents in the
earth. The wall of trees looked almost whole.
“I did not mean to do this. It was as if I tried to open a tap, and instead pulled the whole tap out
of the barrel. It . . . filled me. I had to send it somewhere before it burned me up, but I . . . I did not
mean this.”
Perrin shook his head. What use to tell him to try not to do it again? He barely knows more
about what he’s doing than I do. He contented himself with, “There are enough who want you dead

—and the rest of us—without you doing the job for them.” Rand did not seem to be listening. “We had
best get on back to the camp. It will be dark soon, and I don’t know about you, but I am hungry.”
“What? Oh. You go on, Perrin. I will be along. I want to be alone again a while.”
Perrin hesitated, then turned reluctantly toward the crack in the valley wall. He stopped when
Rand spoke again.
“Do you have dreams when you sleep? Good dreams?”
“Sometimes,” Perrin said warily. “I don’t remember much of what I dream.” He had learned to
set guards on his dreaming.
“They’re always there, dreams,” Rand said, so softly Perrin barely heard. “Maybe they tell us
things. True things.” He fell silent, brooding.
“Supper’s waiting,” Perrin said, but Rand was deep in his own thoughts. Finally Perrin turned
and left him standing there.

CHAPTER
3

News from the Plain

Darkness shrouded part of the crack, for in one place the tremors had collapsed a part of the
wall against the other side, high up. He stared up at the blackness warily before hurrying underneath,
but the slab of stone seemed to be solidly wedged in place. The itch had returned to the back of his
head, stronger than before. No, burn me! No! It went away.
When he came out above the camp, the bowl was filled with odd shadows from the sinking sun.
Moiraine was standing outside her hut, peering up at the crack. He stopped short. She was a slender,
dark-haired woman no taller than his shoulder, and pretty, with the ageless quality of all Aes Sedai
who had worked with the One Power for a time. He could not put any age at all to her, with her face
too smooth for many years and her dark eyes too wise for youth. Her dress of deep blue silk was
disarrayed and dusty, and wisps stuck out in her usually well-ordered hair. A smudge of dust lay
across her face.
He dropped his eyes. She knew about him—she and Lan alone, of those in the camp—and he did
not like the knowing in her face when she looked into his eyes. Yellow eyes. Someday, perhaps, he
could bring himself to ask her what she knew. An Aes Sedai must know more of it than he did. But
this was not the time. There never seemed to be a time. “He. . . . He didn’t mean. . . . It was an
accident.”
“An accident,” she said in a flat voice, then shook her head and vanished back inside the hut.
The door banged shut a little loudly.
Perrin drew a deep breath and continued on down toward the cook fires. There would be
another argument between Rand and the Aes Sedai, in the morning if not tonight.
Half a dozen trees lay toppled on the slopes of the bowl, roots ripped out of the earth in arcs of
soil. A trail of scrapes and churned ground led down to the streamside and a boulder that had not
been there before. One of the huts up the opposite slope had collapsed in the tremors, and most of the
Shienarans were gathered around it, rebuilding it. Loial was with them. The Ogier could pick up a log
it would take four men to lift. Uno’s curses occasionally drifted down.
Min stood by the fires, stirring a kettle with a disgruntled expression. There was a small bruise
on her cheek, and a faint smell of burned stew hung in the air. “I hate cooking,” she announced, and
peered doubtfully into the kettle. “If something goes wrong with it, it isn’t my fault. Rand spilled half
of it on the fire with his. . . . What right does he have to bounce us around like sacks of grain?” She
rubbed the seat of her breeches and winced. “When I get my hands on him, I’ll thump him so he never
forgets.” She waved the wooden spoon at Perrin as if she intended to start the thumping with him.
“Was anyone hurt?”
“Only if you count bruises,” Min said grimly. “They were upset, all right, at first. Then they saw
Moiraine staring off toward Rand’s hidey-hole, and decided it was his work. If the Dragon wants to

shake the mountain down on our heads, then the Dragon must have a good reason for it. If he decided
to make them take off their skins and dance in their bones, they would think it all right.” She snorted
and rapped the spoon on the edge of the kettle.
He looked back toward Moiraine’s hut. If Leya had been hurt—if she were dead—the Aes Sedai
would not simply have gone back inside. The sense of waiting was still there. Whatever it is, it
hasn’t happened yet. “Min, maybe you had better go. First thing in the morning. I have some silver I
can let you have, and I’m sure Moiraine would give you enough to take passage with a merchant’s
train out of Ghealdan. You could be back in Baerlon before you know it.”
She looked at him until he began to wonder if he had said something wrong. Finally, she said,
“That is very sweet of you, Perrin. But, no.”
“I thought you wanted to go. You’re always carrying on about having to stay here.”
“I knew an old Illianer woman; once,” she said slowly. “When she was young, her mother
arranged a marriage for her with a man she had never even met. They do that down in Illian,
sometimes. She said she spent the first five years raging against him, and the next five scheming to
make his life miserable without his knowing who was to blame. It was only years later, she said,
when he died, that she realized he really had been the love of her life.”
“I don’t see what that has to do with this.”
Her look said he obviously was not trying to understand, and her voice became overly patient.
“Just because fate has chosen something for you instead of you choosing it for yourself doesn’t mean
it has to be bad. Even if it’s something you are sure you would never have chosen in a hundred years.
‘Better ten days of love than years of regretting,’ ” she quoted.
“I understand that even less,” he told her. “You don’t have to stay if you don’t want to.”
She hung the spoon on a tall forked stick stuck in the ground, then surprised him by rising on
tiptoe to kiss his cheek. “You are a very nice man, Perrin Aybara. Even if you don’t understand
anything.”
Perrin blinked at her uncertainly. He wished that he could be certain Rand was in his right mind,
or that Mat were there. He was never sure of his ground with girls, but Rand always seemed to know
his way. So did Mat; most of the girls back home in Emond’s Field had sniffed that Mat would never
grow up, but he had seemed to have a way with them.
“What about you, Perrin? Don’t you ever want to go home?”
“All the time,” he said fervently. “But I . . . I do not think I can. Not yet.” He looked off toward
Rand’s vale. We are tied together, it seems, aren’t we, Rand? “Maybe not ever.” He thought he had
said that too softly for her to hear, but the look she gave him was full of sympathy. And agreement.
His ears caught faint footsteps behind him, and he looked back up toward Moiraine’s hut. Two
shapes were making their way down through the deepening twilight, one a woman, slender and
graceful even on the rough, slanting ground. The man, head and shoulders taller than his companion,
turned off toward where the Shienarans were working. Even to Perrin’s eyes he was indistinct,
sometimes seeming to vanish altogether, then reappear in midstride, parts of him fading into the night
and fading back as the wind gusted. Only a Warder’s shifting cloak could do that, which made the
larger figure Lan, just as the smaller was certainly Moiraine.
Well behind them, another shape, even dimmer, slipped between the trees. Rand, Perrin thought,
going back to his hut. Another night when he won’t eat because he can’t stand the way everybody
looks at him.
“You must have eyes in the back of your head,” Min said, frowning toward the approaching
woman. “Or else the sharpest ears I have ever heard of. Is that Moiraine?”

Careless. He had grown so used to the Shienarans knowing how well he could see—in daylight
at least; they did not know about the night—that he was beginning to slip about other things.
Carelessness might kill me yet.
“Is the Tuatha’an woman all right?” Min asked as Moiraine came to the fire.
“She is resting.” The Aes Sedai’s low voice had its usual musical quality, as if speaking were
halfway to singing, and her hair and clothes were back in perfect order again. She rubbed her hands
over the fire. There was a golden ring on her left hand, a serpent biting its own tail. The Great
Serpent, an even older symbol for eternity than the Wheel of Time. Every woman trained in Tar Valon
wore such a ring.
For a moment Moiraine’s gaze rested on Perrin, and seemed to penetrate too deeply. “She fell
and split her scalp when Rand. . . .” Her mouth tightened, but in the next instant her face was utter
calm again. “I Healed her, and she is sleeping. There is always a good deal of blood with even a
minor scalp wound, but it was not serious. Did you see anything about her, Min?”
Min looked uncertain. “I saw. . . . I thought I saw her death. Her own face, all over blood. I was
sure I knew what it meant, but if she split her scalp. . . . Are you sure she is all right?” It was a
measure of her discomfort that she asked. An Aes Sedai did not Heal and leave anything wrong that
could be Healed. And Moiraine’s Talents were particularly strong in that area.
Min sounded so troubled that Perrin was surprised for a moment. Then he nodded to himself.
She did not really like doing what she did, but it was a part of her; she thought she knew how it
worked, or some of it, at least. If she was wrong, it would almost be like finding out she did not know
how to use her own hands.
Moiraine considered her for a moment, serene and dispassionate. “You have never been wrong
in any reading for me, not one about which I had any way of knowing. Perhaps this is the first time.”
“When I know, I know,” Min whispered obstinately. “Light help me, I do.”
“Or perhaps it is yet to come. She has a long way yet to travel, to return to her wagons, and she
must ride through unsettled lands.”
The Aes Sedai’s voice was a cool song, uncaring. Perrin made an involuntary sound in his
throat. Light, did I sound like that? I won’t let a death matter that little to me.
As if he had spoken aloud, Moiraine looked at him. “The Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills,
Perrin. I told you long ago that we were in a war. We cannot stop just because some of us may die.
Any of us may die before it is done. Leya’s weapons may not be the same as yours, but she knew that
when she became part of it.”
Perrin dropped his eyes. That’s as may be, Aes Sedai, but I will never accept it the way you do.
Lan joined them across the fire, with Uno and Loial. The flames cast flickering shadows across
the Warder’s face, making it seem more carved from stone even than it normally did, all hard planes
and angles. His cloak was not much easier to look at in the firelight. Sometimes it seemed only a dark
gray cloak, or black, but the gray and black appeared to crawl and change if you looked too closely,
shades and shadows sliding across it, soaking into it. Other times, it looked as if Lan had somehow
made a hole in the night and pulled darkness ’round his shoulders. Not at all an easy thing to watch,
and not made any easier by the man who wore it.
Lan was tall and hard, broad-shouldered, with blue eyes like frozen mountain lakes, and he
moved with a deadly grace that made the sword on his hip seem a part of him. It was not that he
seemed merely capable of violence and death; this man had tamed violence and death and kept them
in his pocket, ready to be loosed in a heartbeat, or embraced, should Moiraine give the word. Beside
Lan, even Uno appeared less dangerous. There was a touch of gray in the Warder’s long hair, held

back by a woven leather cord around his forehead, but younger men stepped back from confronting
Lan—if they were wise.
“Mistress Leya has the usual news from Almoth Plain,” Moiraine said. “Everyone fighting
everyone else. Villages burned. People fleeing in every direction. And Hunters have appeared on the
plain, searching for the Horn of Valere.” Perrin shifted—the Horn was where no Hunter on Almoth
Plain would find it; where he hoped no Hunter ever would find it—and she gave him a cool look
before continuing. She did not like any of them to speak of the Horn. Except when she chose to, of
course.
“She brought different news, as well. The Whitecloaks have perhaps five thousand men on
Almoth Plain.”
Uno grunted. “That’s flamin’—uh, pardon, Aes Sedai. That must be half their strength. They’ve
never committed so much to one place before.”
“Then I suppose all those who declared for Rand are dead or scattered,” Perrin muttered. “Or
they soon will be. You were right, Moiraine.” He did not like the thought of Whitecloaks. He did not
like the Children of the Light at all.
“That is what is odd,” Moiraine said. “Or the first part of it. The Children have announced that
their purpose is to bring peace, which is not unusual for them. What is unusual is that while they are
trying to force the Taraboners and the Domani back across their respective borders, they have not
moved in any force against those who have declared for the Dragon.”
Min gave an exclamation of surprise. “Is she certain? That does not sound like any Whitecloaks I
ever heard of.”
“There can’t be many blood—uh—many Tinkers left on the plain,” Uno said. His voice creaked
from the strain of watching his language in front of an Aes Sedai. His real eye matched the frown of
the painted one. “They don’t like to stay where there’s any kind of trouble, especially fighting. There
can’t be enough of them to see everywhere.”
“There are enough for my purposes,” Moiraine said firmly. “Most have gone, but some few
remained because I asked them to. And Leya is quite certain. Oh, the Children have snapped up some
of the Dragonsworn, where there were only a handful gathered. But though they proclaim they will
bring down this false Dragon, though they have a thousand men supposedly doing nothing but hunting
him, they avoid contact with any party of as many as fifty Dragonsworn. Not openly, you understand,
but there is always some delay, something that allows those they chase to slip away.”
“Then Rand can go down to them as he wants.” Loial blinked uncertainly at the Aes Sedai. The
whole camp knew of her arguments with Rand. “The Wheel weaves a way for him.”
Uno and Lan opened their mouths at the same time, but the Shienaran gave way with a small
bow. “More likely,” the Warder said, “it is some Whitecloak plot, though the Light burn me if I can
see what it is. But when the Whitecloaks give me a gift, I search for the poisoned needle hidden in it.”
Uno nodded grimly. “Besides which,” Lan added, “the Domani and the Taraboners are still trying as
hard to kill the Dragonsworn as they are to kill each other.”
“And there is another thing,” Moiraine said. “Three young men have died in villages Mistress
Leya’s wagons passed near.” Perrin noticed a flicker of Lan’s eyelid; for the Warder, it was as much
a sign of surprise as a shout from another man. Lan had not expected her to tell this. Moiraine went
on. “One died by poison, two by the knife. Each in circumstances where no one should have been
able to come close unseen, but that is how it happened.” She peered into the flames. “All three young
men were taller than most, and had light-colored eyes. Light eyes are uncommon on Almoth Plain, but
I think it is very unlucky right now to be a tall young man with light eyes there.”

“How?” Perrin asked. “How could they be killed if no one could get close to them?”
“The Dark One has killers you don’t notice until it is too late,” Lan said quietly.
Uno gave a shiver. “The Soulless. I never heard of one south of the Borderlands before.”
“Enough of such talk,” Moiraine said firmly.
Perrin had questions—What in the Light are the Soulless? Are they like a Trolloc, or a Fade?
What?—but he left them unasked. When Moiraine decided enough had been said about something, she
would not talk of it anymore. And when she shut her mouth, you could not pry Lan’s open with an iron
bar. The Shienarans followed her lead, too. No one wanted to anger an Aes Sedai.
“Light!” Min muttered, uneasily eyeing the deepening darkness around them. “You don’t notice
them? Light!”
“So nothing has changed,” Perrin said glumly. “Not really. We cannot go down to the plain, and
the Dark One wants us dead.”
“Everything changes,” Moiraine said calmly, “and the Pattern takes it all in. We must ride on the
Pattern, not on the changes of a moment.” She looked at them each in turn, then said, “Uno, are you
certain your scouts missed nothing suspicious? Even something small?”
“The Lord Dragon’s Rebirth has loosed the bonds of certainty, Moiraine Sedai, and there is
never certainty if you fight Myrddraal, but I will stake my life that the scouts did as good a job as any
Warder.” It was one of the longest speeches Perrin had ever heard out of Uno without any curses.
There was sweat on the man’s forehead from the effort.
“We all may,” Moiraine said. “What Rand did might as well have been a fire on the mountaintop
for any Myrddraal within ten miles.”
“Maybe . . .” Min began hesitantly. “Maybe you ought to set wards that will keep them out.” Lan
gave her a hard stare. He sometimes questioned Moiraine’s decisions himself, though he seldom did
so where anyone could overhear, but he did not approve of others doing the same. Min frowned right
back at him. “Well, Myrddraal and Trollocs are bad enough, but at least I can see them. I don’t like
the idea that one of these . . . these Soulless might sneak in here and slit my throat before I even
noticed him.”
“The wards I set will hide us from the Soulless as well as from any other Shadowspawn,”
Moiraine said. “When you are weak, as we are, the best choice is often to hide. If there is a Halfman
close enough to have. . . . Well, to set wards that would kill them if they tried to enter camp is beyond
my abilities, and even if I could, such a warding would only pen us here. Since it is not possible to
set two kinds of warding at once, I leave the scouts and the guards—and Lan—to defend us, and use
the one warding that may do some good.”
“I could make a circuit around the camp,” Lan said. “If there is anything out there that the scouts
missed, I will find it.” It was not a boast, just a statement of fact. Uno even nodded agreement.
Moiraine shook her head. “If you are needed tonight, my Gaidin, it will be here.” Her gaze rose
toward the dark mountains around them. “There is a feeling in the air.”
“Waiting.” The word left Perrin’s tongue before he could stop it. When Moiraine looked at him
—into him—he wished he had it back.
“Yes,” she said. “Waiting. Make sure your guards are especially alert tonight, Uno.” There was
no need to suggest that the men sleep with their weapons close at hand; Shienarans always did that.
“Sleep well,” she added to them all, as if there were any chance of that now, and started back for her
hut. Lan stayed long enough to spoon up three dishes of stew, then hurried after her, quickly
swallowed by the night.
Perrin’s eyes shone golden as they followed the Warder through the darkness. “Sleep well,” he

muttered. The smell of cooked meat suddenly made him queasy. “I have the third watch, Uno?” The
Shienaran nodded. “Then I will try to take her advice.” Others were coming to the fires, and murmurs
of conversation followed him up the slope.
He had a hut to himself, a small thing of logs barely tall enough to stand in, the chinks filled with
dried mud. A rough bed, padded with pine boughs beneath a blanket, took up nearly half of it.
Whoever had unsaddled his horse had also propped his bow just inside the door. He hung up his belt,
with axe and quiver, on a peg, then stripped down to his smallclothes, shivering. The nights were
cold still, but cold kept him from sleeping too deeply. In deep sleep, dreams came that he could not
shake off.
For a time, with a single blanket over him, he lay staring at the log roof, shivering. Then sleep
came, and with it, dreams.

CHAPTER

Shadows Sleeping

Cold filled the common room of the inn despite the fire blazing on the long, stone hearth. Perrin
rubbed his hands before the flames, but he could get no warmth in them. There was an odd comfort in
the cold, though, as if it were a shield. A shield against what, he could not think. Something murmured
in the back of his mind, a dim sound only vaguely heard, scratching to get in.
“So you will give it up, then. It is the best thing for you. Come. Sit, and we will talk.”
Perrin turned to look at the speaker. The round tables scattered about the room were empty
except for the lone man seated in a corner, in the shadows. The rest of the room seemed in some way
hazy, almost an impression rather than a place, especially anything he was not looking at directly. He
glanced back at the fire; it burned on a brick hearth, now. Somehow, none of it bothered him. It
should. But he could not have said why.
The man beckoned, and Perrin walked closer to his table. A square table. The tables were
square. Frowning, he reached out to finger the tabletop, but pulled his hand back. There were no
lamps in that corner of the room, and despite the light elsewhere, the man and his table were almost
hidden, nearly blended with the dimness.
Perrin had a feeling that he knew the man, but it was as vague as what he saw out of the corner of
his eye. The fellow was in his middle years, handsome and too well dressed for a country inn, in
dark, nearly black, velvets with white lace falls at his collar and cuffs. He sat stiffly, sometimes
pressing a hand to his chest, as if moving hurt him. His dark eyes were fixed on Perrin’s face; they
appeared like glistening points in the shadows.
“Give up what?” Perrin asked.
“That, of course.” The man nodded to the axe at Perrin’s waist. He sounded surprised, as if it
were a conversation they had had before, an old argument taken up again.
Perrin had not realized the axe was there, had not felt the weight of it pulling at his belt. He ran a
hand over the half-moon blade and the thick spike that balanced it. The steel felt—solid. More solid
than anything else there. Maybe even more solid than he was himself. He kept his hand there, to hold
onto something real.
“I have thought of it,” he said, “but I do not think I can. Not yet.” Not yet? The inn seemed to
flicker, and the murmur sounded again in his head. No! The murmur faded.
“No?” The man smiled, a cold smile. “You are a blacksmith, boy. And a good one, from what I
hear. Your hands were made for a hammer, not an axe. Made to make things, not to kill. Go back to
that before it is too late.”
Perrin found himself nodding. “Yes. But I’m ta’veren.” He had never said that out loud before.
But he knows it already. He was sure of that, though he could not say why.
For an instant the man’s smile became a grimace, but then it returned in more strength than

before. A cold strength. “There are ways to change things, boy. Ways to avoid even fate. Sit, and we
will talk of them.” The shadows appeared to shift and thicken, to reach out.
Perrin took a step back, keeping well in the light. “I don’t think so.”
“At least have a drink with me. To years past and years to come. Here, you will see things more
clearly after.” The cup the man pushed across the table had not been there a moment before. It shone
bright silver, and dark, blood-red wine filled it to the brim.
Perrin peered at the man’s face. Even to his sharp eyes, the shadows seemed to shroud the other
man’s features like a Warder’s cloak. Darkness molded the man like a caress. There was something
about the man’s eyes, something he thought he could remember if he tried hard enough. The murmur
returned.
“No,” he said. He spoke to the soft sound inside his head, but when the man’s mouth tightened in
anger, a flash of rage suppressed as soon as begun, he decided it would do for the wine as well. “I am
not thirsty.”
He turned and started for the door. The fireplace was rounded river stones; a few long tables
lined by benches filled the room. He suddenly wanted to be outside, anywhere away from this man.
“You will not have many chances,” the man said behind him in a hard voice. “Three threads
woven together share one another’s doom. When one is cut, all are. Fate can kill you, if it does not do
worse.”
Perrin felt a sudden heat against his back, rising then fading just as quickly, as if the doors of a
huge smelting furnace had swung open and closed again. Startled, he turned back to the room. It was
empty.
Only a dream, he thought, shivering from the cold, and with that everything shifted.
He stared into the mirror, a part of him not comprehending what he saw, another part accepting.
A gilded helmet, worked like a lion’s head, sat on his head as if it belonged there. Gold leaf covered
his ornately hammered breastplate, and gold-work embellished the plate and mail on his arms and
legs. Only the axe at his side was plain. A voice—his own—whispered in his mind that he would
take it over any other weapon, had carried it a thousand times, in a hundred battles. No! He wanted to
take it off, throw it away. I can’t! There was a sound in his head, louder than a murmur, almost at the
level of understanding.
“A man destined for glory.”
He spun away from the mirror and found himself staring at the most beautiful woman he had ever
seen. He noticed nothing else about the room, cared to see nothing but her. Her eyes were pools of
midnight, her skin creamy pale and surely softer, more smooth than her dress of white silk. When she
moved toward him, his mouth went dry. He realized that every other woman he had ever seen was
clumsy and ill-shaped. He shivered, and wondered why he felt cold.
“A man should grasp his destiny with both hands,” she said, smiling. It was almost enough to
warm him, that smile. She was tall, less than a hand short of being able to look him in the eyes. Silver
combs held hair darker than a raven’s wing. A broad belt of silver links banded a waist he could
have encircled with his hands.
“Yes,” he whispered. Inside him, startlement fought with acceptance. He had no use for glory.
But when she said it, he wanted nothing else. “I mean. . . .” The murmuring sound dug at his skull.
“No!” It was gone, and for a moment, so was acceptance. Almost. He put a hand to his head, touched
the golden helmet, took it off. “I . . . I don’t think I want this. It is not mine.”
“Don’t want it?” She laughed. “What man with blood in his veins would not want glory? As
much glory as if you had sounded the Horn of Valere.”

“I don’t,” he said, though a piece of him shouted that he lied. The Horn of Valere. The Horn
rang out, and the wild charge began. Death rode at his shoulder, and yet she waited ahead, too.
His lover. His destroyer. “No! I am a blacksmith.”
Her smile was pitying. “Such a little thing to want. You must not listen to those who would try to
turn you from your destiny. They would demean you, debase you. Destroy you. Fighting fate can only
bring pain. Why choose pain, when you can have glory? When your name can be remembered
alongside all the heroes of legend?”
“I am no hero.”
“You don’t know the half of what you are. Of what you can be. Come, share a cup with me, to
destiny and glory.” There was a shining silver cup in her hand, filled with blood-red wine. “Drink.”
He stared at the cup, frowning. There was something . . . familiar about it. A growling chewed at
his brain. “No!” He fought away from it, refusing to listen. “No!”
She held out the golden cup to him. “Drink.”
Golden? I thought the cup was. . . . It was. . . . The rest of the thought would not come. But in
his confusion the sound came again, inside, gnawing, demanding to be heard. “No,” he said. “No!” He
looked at the golden helmet in his hands and threw it aside. “I am a blacksmith. I am. . . .” The sound
within his head fought him, struggling toward being heard. He wrapped his arms around his head to
shut it out, and only shut it in. “I—am—a—man!” he shouted.
Darkness enfolded him, but her voice followed, whispering. “The night is always there, and
dreams come to all men. Especially you, my wildling. And I will always be in your dreams.”
Stillness.
He lowered his arms. He was back in his own coat and breeches again, sturdy and well made, if
plain. Suitable garb for a blacksmith, or any country man. Yet he barely noticed them.
He stood on a low-railed bridge of stone, arching from one wide, flat-topped stone spire to
another, spires that rose from depths too far for even his eyes to penetrate. The light would have been
dim to any other eyes, and he could not make out from where it came. It just was. Everywhere he
looked, left and right, up or down, were more bridges, more spires, and railless ramps. There seemed
no end to them, no pattern. Worse, some of those ramps climbed to spire tops that had to be directly
above the ones they had left. Splashing water echoed, the sound seeming to come from everywhere at
once. He shivered with cold.
Suddenly, from the corner of his eye, he caught a motion, and without thinking, he crouched
behind the stone railing. There was danger in being seen. He did not know why, but he knew it was
true. He just knew.
Cautiously peering over the top of the rail, he sought what he had seen moving. A flash of white
flickered on a distant ramp. A woman, he was sure, though he could not quite make her out. A woman
in a white dress, hurrying somewhere.
On a bridge slightly below him, and much closer than the ramp where the woman had been, a
man suddenly appeared, tall and dark and slender, the silver in his black hair giving him a
distinguished look, his dark green coat thickly embroidered with golden leaves. Gold-work covered
his belt and pouch, and gems sparkled on his dagger sheath, and golden fringe encircled his boot tops.
Where had he come from?
Another man started across the bridge from the other side, his appearance as sudden as the first
man’s. Black stripes ran down the puffy sleeves of his red coat, and pale lace hung thick at his collar
and cuffs. His boots were so worked with silver that it was hard to see the leather. He was shorter
than the man he went to meet, more stocky, with close-cropped hair as white as his lace. Age did not

make him frail, though. He strode with the same arrogant strength the other man showed.
The two of them approached each other warily. Like two horse traders who know the other
fellow has a spavined mare to sell, Perrin thought.
The men began to talk. Perrin strained his ears, but he could not hear so much as a murmur above
the splashing echoes. Frowns, and glares, and sharp motions as if half on the point of striking. They
did not trust one another. He thought they might even hate each other.
He glanced up, searching for the woman, but she was gone. When he looked back down, another
man had joined the first two. And somehow, from somewhere, Perrin knew him with the vagueness of
an old memory. A handsome man in his middle years, wearing nearly black velvet and white lace. An
inn, Perrin thought. And something before that. Something. . . . Something a long time ago, it seemed.
But the memory would not come.
The first two men stood side by side, now, made uncomfortable allies by the presence of the
newcomer. He shouted at them and shook his fist, while they shifted uneasily, refusing to meet his
glares. If the two hated each other, they feared him more.
His eyes, Perrin thought. What is strange about his eyes?
The tall, dark man began to argue back, slowly at first, then with increasing fervor. The whitehaired man joined in, and suddenly their temporary alliance broke. All three shouted at once, each at
both of the others in turn. Abruptly the man in dark velvets threw his arms wide, as if demanding an
end to it. And an expanding ball of fire enveloped them, hid them, spreading out and out.
Perrin threw his arms around his head and dropped behind the stone railing, huddling there as
wind buffeted him and tore at his clothes, a wind as hot as fire. A wind that was fire. Even with his
eyes shut, he could see it, flame billowing across everything, flame blowing through everything. The
fiery gale roared through him, too; he could feel it, burning, tugging, trying to consume him and scatter
the ashes. He yelled, trying to hang onto himself, knowing it was not enough.
And between one heartbeat and the next, the wind was gone. There was no diminishing. One
instant a storm of flame pummeled him; the next, utter stillness. The echoes of falling water were the
only sound.
Slowly, Perrin sat up, examining himself. His clothes were unsinged and whole, his exposed
skin unburned. Only the memory of heat made him believe it had happened. A memory in the mind
alone; his body felt no memory of it.
Cautiously he peeked over the railing. Only a few paces of half-melted footing at either end
remained of the bridge where the men had been standing. Of them, there was no sign.
A prickling in the hair on the back of his neck made him look up. On a ramp above him and to the
right, a shaggy gray wolf stood looking at him.
“No!” He scrambled to his feet and ran. “This is a dream! A nightmare! I want to wake up!” He
ran, and his vision blurred. The blurs shifted. A buzzing filled his ears, then faded, and as it went, the
shimmering in his eyes steadied.
He shivered with the cold and knew this for a dream, certain and sure, from the first moment. He
was dimly aware of some shadowy memory of dreams preceding this, but this one he knew. He had
been in this place before, on previous nights, and if he understood nothing of it, he still knew it for a
dream. For once, knowing changed nothing.
Huge columns of polished redstone surrounded the open space where he stood, beneath a domed
ceiling fifty paces or more above his head. He and another man as big could not have encircled one of
those columns with their arms. The floor was paved with great slabs of pale gray stone, hard yet worn
by countless generations of feet.

And centered beneath the dome was the reason why all those feet had come to this chamber. A
sword, hanging hilt down in the air, apparently without support, seemingly where anyone could reach
out and take it. It revolved slowly, as if some breath of air caught it. Yet it was not really a sword. It
seemed made of glass, or perhaps crystal, blade and hilt and crossguard, catching such light as there
was and shattering it into a thousand glitters and flashes.
He walked toward it and put out his hand, as he had done each time before. He clearly
remembered doing it. The hilt hung there in front of his face, within easy reach. A foot from the
shining sword, his hand splayed out against empty air as if it had touched stone. As he had known it
would. He pushed harder, but he might as well have been shoving against a wall. The sword turned
and sparkled, a foot away and as far out of reach as if on the other side of an ocean.
Callandor. He was not certain whether the whisper came inside his head or out; it seemed to
echo ’round the columns, as soft as the wind, everywhere at once, insistent. Callandor. Who wields
me wields destiny. Take me, and begin the final journey.
He took a step back, suddenly frightened. That whisper had never come before. Four times
before he had had this dream—he could remember that even now; four nights, one after the other—
and this was the first time anything had changed in it.
The Twisted Ones come.
It was a different whisper, from a source he knew, and he jumped as if a Myrddraal had touched
him. A wolf stood there among the columns, a mountain wolf, almost waist-high and shaggy white and
gray. It stared at him intently with eyes as yellow as his own.
The Twisted Ones come.
“No,” Perrin rasped. “No! I will not let you in! I—will—not!”
He clawed his way awake and sat up in his hut, shaking with fear and cold and anger. “I will
not,” he whispered hoarsely.
The Twisted Ones come.
The thought was clear in his head, but the thought was not his own.
The Twisted Ones come, brother.

CHAPTER
5
Nightmares Walking

Leaping from his bed, Perrin snatched his axe and ran outside, barefoot and wearing nothing
but thin linen, heedless of the cold. The moon bathed the clouds with pale white. More than enough
light for his eyes, more than enough to see the shapes slipping through the trees from all sides, shapes
almost as big as Loial, but with faces distorted by muzzles and beaks, half-human heads wearing
horns and feathered crests, stealthy forms stalking on hooves or paws as often as booted feet.
He opened his mouth to shout warning, and suddenly the door of Moiraine’s hut burst open and
Lan dashed out, sword in hand and shouting, “Trollocs! Wake, for your lives! Trollocs!” Shouts
answered him as men began to tumble from their huts, garbed for sleep, which for most meant not at
all, but with swords ready. With a bestial roar, the Trollocs rushed forward to be met with steel and
cries of “Shienar!” and “The Dragon Reborn!”
Lan was fully clothed—Perrin would have bet the Warder had not slept—and he flung himself
among the Trollocs as if his wool were armor. He seemed to dance from one to another, man and
sword flowing like water or wind, and where the Warder danced, Trollocs screamed and died.
Moiraine was out in the night as well, dancing her own dance among the Trollocs. Her only
apparent weapon was a switch, but where she slashed a Trolloc, a line of flame grew on its flesh.
Her free hand threw fiery balls summoned from thin air, and Trollocs howled as flames consumed
them, thrashing on the ground.
An entire tree burst into flame from root to crown, then another, and another. Trollocs shrieked
at the sudden light, but they did not stop swinging their spiked axes and swords curved like scythes.
Abruptly Perrin saw Leya step hesitantly out of Moiraine’s cabin, halfway around the bowl from
him, and all thought of anything else left him. The Tuatha’an woman pressed her back against the log
wall, a hand to her throat. The light from the burning trees showed him the pain and horror, the
loathing on her face as she watched the carnage.
“Hide!” Perrin shouted at her. “Get back inside and hide!” The swelling roar of fighting and
dying swallowed his words. He ran toward her. “Hide, Leya! For the love of the Light, hide!”
A Trolloc loomed up over him, a cruelly hooked beak where its mouth and nose should have
been. Black mail and spikes covered it from shoulders to knees, and it moved on a hawk’s talons as it
swung one of those strangely curved swords. It smelled of sweat and dirt and blood.
Perrin crouched under the slash, shouting wordlessly as he struck out with his axe. He knew he
should have been afraid, but urgency suppressed fear. All that mattered was that he had to reach Leya,
had to get her to safety, and the Trolloc was in the way.
The Trolloc fell, roaring and kicking; Perrin did not know where he had hit it, or if it were dying
or merely hurt. He leaped over it, where it lay thrashing, and ran scrambling up the slope.
Burning trees cast lurid shadows across the small valley. A flickering shadow beside
Moiraine’s hut suddenly resolved into a Trolloc, goat-snouted and horned. Gripping a wildly spiked

axe with both hands, it seemed on the point of rushing down into the fray when its eyes fell on Leya.
“No!” Perrin shouted. “Light, no!” Rocks skittered away under his bare feet; he did not feel the
bruises. The Trolloc’s axe rose. “Leyaaaaaaaa!”
At the last instant the Trolloc spun, axe flashing toward Perrin. He threw himself down, yelling
as steel scored his back. Desperately he flung out a hand, caught a goat hoof, and pulled with all his
strength. The Trolloc’s feet came out from under it, and it fell with a crash, but as it slid down the
slope, it seized Perrin in hands big enough to make two of his, pulling him along to roll over and
over. The stink of it filled his nostrils, goat-stench and sour man-sweat. Massive arms snaked around
his chest, squeezing the air out; his ribs creaked on the point of breaking. The Trolloc’s axe was gone
in the fall, but blunt goat-teeth sank into Perrin’s shoulder, powerful jaws chewing. He groaned as
pain jolted down his left arm. His lungs labored for breath, and blackness crept in on the edges of his
vision, but dimly he was aware that his other arm was free, that somehow he had held on to his own
axe. He held it short on the handle, like a hammer, with the spike foremost. With a roar that took the
last of his air, he drove the spike into the Trolloc’s temple. Soundlessly it convulsed, limbs flinging
wide, hurling him away. By instinct alone his hand tightened on the axe, ripping it loose as the
Trolloc slid further down the slope, still twitching.
For a moment Perrin lay there, fighting for breath. The gash across his back burned, and he felt
the wetness of blood. His shoulder protested as he pushed himself up. “Leya?”
She was still there, huddled in front of the hut, not more than ten paces upslope. And watching
him with such a look on her face that he could barely meet her eyes.
“Don’t pity me!” he growled at her. “Don’t you—!”
The Myrddraal’s leap from the roof of the hut seemed to take too long, and its dead black cloak
hung during the slow fall as if the Halfman were standing on the ground already. Its eyeless gaze was
fixed on Perrin. It smelled like death.
Cold seeped through Perrin’s arms and legs as the Myrddraal stared at him. His chest felt like a
lump of ice. “Leya,” he whispered. It was all he could do not to run. “Leya, please hide. Please.”
The Halfman started toward him, slowly, confident that fear held him in a snare. It moved like a
snake, unlimbering a sword so black only the burning trees made it visible. “Cut one leg of the
tripod,” it said softly, “and all fall down.” Its voice sounded like dry-rotted leather crumbling.
Suddenly Leya moved, throwing herself forward, attempting to wrap her arms around the
Myrddraal’s legs. It gave an almost casual backwards swing of its dark sword, never even looking
around, and she crumpled.
Tears started in the corners of Perrin’s eyes. I should have helped her . . . saved her. I should
have done . . . something! But so long as the Myrddraal stared at him with its eyeless gaze, it was an
effort even to think.
We come, brother. We come, Young Bull.
The words inside his mind made his head ring like a struck bell; the reverberations shivered
through him. With the words came the wolves, scores of them, flooding into his mind as he was aware
of them flooding into the bowl-shaped valley. Mountain wolves almost as tall as a man’s waist, all
white and gray, coming out of the night at the run, aware of the two-legs’ surprise as they darted in to
take on the Twisted Ones. Wolves filled him till he could barely remember being a man. His eyes
gathered the light, shining golden yellow. And the Halfman stopped its advance as if suddenly
uncertain.
“Fade,” Perrin said roughly, but then a different name came to him, from the wolves. Trollocs,
the Twisted Ones, made during the War of the Shadow from melding men and animals, were bad

enough, but the Myrddraal—. “Neverborn!” Young Bull spat. Lip curling back in a snarl, he threw
himself at the Myrddraal.
It moved like a viper, sinuous and deadly, black sword quick as lightning, but he was Young
Bull. That was what the wolves called him. Young Bull, with horns of steel that he wielded with his
hands. He was one with the wolves. He was a wolf, and any wolf would die a hundred times over to
see one of the Neverborn go down. The Fade fell back before him, its darting blade now trying to
deflect his slashes.
Hamstring and throat, that was how wolves killed. Young Bull suddenly threw himself to one
side and dropped to a knee, axe slicing across the back of the Halfman’s knee. It screamed—a boneburrowing sound to raise his hair at any other time—and fell, catching itself with one hand. The
Halfman—the Neverborn—still held its sword firmly, but before it could set itself, Young Bull’s axe
struck again. Half severed, the Myrddraal’s head flopped over to hang down its back; yet still leaning
there on one hand, the Neverborn slashed wildly with its sword. Neverborn were always long in
dying.
From the wolves as much as his own eyes Young Bull received impressions of Trollocs
thrashing on the ground, shrieking, untouched by wolf or man. Those would have been linked to this
Myrddraal, and would die when it did—if no one killed them first.
The urge to rush down the slope and join his brothers, join in killing the Twisted Ones, in
hunting the remaining Neverborn, was strong, but a buried fragment that was still man remembered.
Leya.
He dropped his axe and turned her over gently. Blood covered her face, and her eyes stared up
at him, glazed with death. An accusing stare, it seemed to him. “I tried,” he told her. “I tried to save
you.” Her stare did not change. “What else could I have done? It would have killed you if I hadn’t
killed it!”
Come, Young Bull. Come kill the Twisted Ones.
Wolf rolled over him, enveloped him. Letting Leya back down, Perrin took up his axe, blade
gleaming wetly. His eyes shone as he raced down the rocky slope. He was Young Bull.
Trees scattered around the bowl-shaped valley burned like torches; a tall pine flared into flame
as Young Bull joined the battle. The night air flashed actinic blue, like sheet lightning, as Lan engaged
another Myrddraal, ancient Aes Sedai–made steel meeting black steel wrought in Thakan’dar, in the
shadow of Shayol Ghul. Loial wielded a quarterstaff the size of a fence rail, the whirling timber
marking a space no Trolloc entered without falling. Men fought desperately in the dancing shadows,
but Young Bull—Perrin—noted in a distant way that too many of the Shienaran two-legs were down.
The brothers and sisters fought in small packs of three or four, dodging scythe-like swords and
spiked axes, darting in with slashing teeth to sever hamstrings, lunging to bite out throats as their prey
fell. There was no honor in the way they fought, no glory, no mercy. They had not come for battle, but
to kill. Young Bull joined one of the small packs, the blade of his axe serving for teeth.
He no longer thought of the greater battle. There was only the Trolloc he and the wolves—the
brothers—cut off from the rest and brought down. Then there would be another, and another, and
another, until none were left. None here, none anywhere. He felt the urge to hurl the axe aside and use
his teeth, to run on all fours as his brothers did. Run through the high mountain passes. Run belly-deep
in powdery snow pursuing deer. Run, with the cold wind ruffling his fur. He snarled with his
brothers, and Trollocs howled with fear at his yellow-eyed gaze even more than they did at the other
wolves.
Abruptly he realized there were no more Trollocs standing anywhere in the bowl, though he

could feel his brothers pursuing others as they fled. A pack of seven had a different prey, somewhere
out there in the darkness. One of the Neverborn ran for its hard-footed four-legs—its horse, a distant
part of him said—and his brothers followed, noses filled with its scent, its essence of death. Inside
his head, he was with them, seeing with their eyes. As they closed in, the Neverborn turned, cursing,
black blade and black-clad Neverborn like part of the night. But night was where his brothers and
sisters hunted.
Young Bull snarled as the first brother died, its death pain lancing him, yet the others closed in
and more brothers and sisters died, but snapping jaws dragged the Neverborn down. It fought back
with its own teeth now, ripping out throats, slashing with fingernails that sliced skin and flesh like the
hard claws the two-legs carried, but brothers savaged it even as they died. Finally a lone sister
heaved herself out of the still-twitching pile and staggered to one side. Morning Mist, she was called,
but as with all their names, it was more than that: a frosty morning with the bite of snows yet to come
already in the air, and the mist curling thick across the valley, swirling with the sharp breeze that
carried the promise of good hunting. Raising her head, Morning Mist howled to the cloud-hidden
moon, mourning her dead.
Young Bull threw back his head and howled with her, mourned with her.
When he lowered his head, Min was staring at him. “Are you all right, Perrin?” she asked
hesitantly. There was a bruise on her cheek, and a sleeve half torn from her coat. She had a cudgel in
one hand and a dagger in the other, and there was blood and hair on both.
They were all staring at him, he saw, all those who were still on their feet. Loial, leaning
wearily on his tall staff. Shienarans, who had been carrying their fallen down to where Moiraine
crouched over one of their number with Lan standing at her side. Even the Aes Sedai was looking his
way. The burning trees, like huge torches, cast a wavering light. Dead Trollocs lay everywhere.
There were more Shienarans down than standing, and the bodies of his brothers were scattered among
them. So many. . . .
Perrin realized he wanted to howl again. Frantically he walled himself off from contact with the
wolves. Images seeped through, emotions, as he tried to stop them. Finally, though, he could no longer
feel them, feel their pain, or their anger, or the desire to hunt the Twisted Ones, or to run. . . . He gave
himself a shake. The wound on his back burned like fire, and his torn shoulder felt as if it had been
hammered on an anvil. His bare feet, scraped and bruised, throbbed with his pain. The smell of blood
was everywhere. The smell of Trollocs, and death.
“I. . . . I’m all right, Min.”
“You fought well, blacksmith,” Lan said. The Warder raised his still-bloody sword above his
head. “Tai’shar Manetheren! Tai’shar Andor!” True Blood of Manetheren. True Blood of Andor.
The Shienarans still standing—so few—lifted their blades and joined him. “Tai’shar
Manetheren! Tai’shar Andor!”
Loial nodded. “Ta’veren,” he added.
Perrin lowered his eyes in embarrassment. Lan had saved him from the questions he did not want
to answer, but had given him an honor he did not deserve. The others did not understand. He
wondered what they would say if they knew the truth. Min moved closer, and he muttered, “Leya’s
dead. I couldn’t. . . . I almost reached her in time.”
“It wouldn’t have made any difference,” she said softly. “You know that.” She leaned to look at
his back, and winced. “Moiraine will take care of that for you. She’s Healing those she can.”
Perrin nodded. His back felt sticky with drying blood all the way to his waist, but despite the
pain he hardly noticed it. Light, I almost didn’t come back that time. I can’t let that happen again. I

won’t. Never again!
But when he was with the wolves, it was all so different. He did not have to worry about
strangers being afraid of him just because he was big, then. There was no one thinking he was slowwitted just because he tried to be careful. Wolves knew each other even if they had never met before,
and with them he was just another wolf.
No! His hands tightened on the haft of his axe. No! He gave a start as Masema suddenly spoke
up.
“It was a sign,” the Shienaran said, turning in a circle to address everyone. There was blood on
his arms and his chest—he had fought in nothing but his breeches—and he moved with a limp, but the
light in his eyes was as fervent as it had ever been. More fervent. “A sign to confirm our faith. Even
wolves came to fight for the Dragon Reborn. In the Last Battle, the Lord Dragon will summon even
the beasts of the forest to fight at our sides. It is a sign for us to go forth. Only Darkfriends will fail to
join us.” Two of the Shienarans nodded.
“You shut your bloody mouth, Masema!” Uno snapped. He seemed untouched, but then Uno had
been fighting Trollocs since before Perrin was born. Yet he sagged with weariness; only the painted
eye on his eyepatch seemed fresh. “We’ll flaming go forth when the Lord Dragon bloody well tells
us, and not before! You sheep-headed farmers flaming remember that!” The one-eyed man looked at
the growing row of men being tended by Moiraine—few were able to as much as sit up, even after
she was done with them—and shook his head. “At least we’ll have plenty of flaming wolf hides to
keep the wounded warm.”
“No!” The Shienarans seemed surprised at the vehemence in Perrin’s voice. “They fought for us,
and we’ll bury them with our dead.”
Uno frowned, and opened his mouth as if to argue, but Perrin fixed him with a steady, yelloweyed stare. It was the Shienaran who dropped his gaze first, and nodded.
Perrin cleared his throat, embarrassed all over again as Uno gave orders for the Shienarans who
were fit to gather the dead wolves. Min was squinting at him the way she did when she saw things.
“Where’s Rand?” he asked her.
“Out there in the dark,” she said, nodding upslope without taking her eyes off him. “He will not
talk to anyone. He just sits there, snapping at anyone who comes near him.”
“He will talk to me,” Perrin said. She followed him, protesting all the while that he ought to wait
until Moiraine had seen to his injuries. Light, what does she see when she looks at me? I don’t want
to know.
Rand was seated on the ground just beyond the light of the burning trees, with his back against
the trunk of a stunted oak. Staring at nothing, he had his arms wrapped around himself, hands under his
red coat, as if feeling the cold. He did not appear to notice their approach. Min sat down beside him,
but he did not move even when she laid a hand on his arm. Even here Perrin smelled blood, and not
only his own.
“Rand,” Perrin began, but Rand cut him off.
“Do you know what I did during the fight?” Still staring into the distance, Rand addressed the
night. “Nothing! Nothing useful. At first, when I reached out for the True Source, I couldn’t touch it,
couldn’t grasp it. It kept sliding away. Then, when I finally had hold of it, I was going to burn them
all, burn all the Trollocs and Fades. And all I could do was set fire to some trees.” He shook with
silent laughter, then stopped with a pained grimace. “Saidin filled me till I thought I’d explode like
fireworks. I had to channel it somewhere, get rid of it before it burned me up, and I found myself
thinking about pulling the mountain down and burying the Trollocs. I almost tried. That was my fight.

Not against the Trollocs. Against myself. To keep from burying us all under the mountain.”
Min gave Perrin a pained look, as if asking for help.
“We . . . dealt with them, Rand,” Perrin said. He shivered, thinking of all the wounded men
down below. And the dead. Better that than the mountain down on top of us. “We didn’t need you.”
Rand’s head fell back against the tree and his eyes closed. “I felt them coming,” he said, nearly
whispering. “I didn’t know what it was, though. They feel like the taint on saidin. And saidin is
always there, calling to me, singing to me. By the time I knew the difference, Lan was already
shouting his warning. If I could only control it, I could have given warning before they were even
close. But half the time when I actually manage to touch saidin, I don’t know what I am doing at all.
The flow of it just sweeps me along. I could have given warning, though.”
Perrin shifted his bruised feet uncomfortably. “We had warning enough.” He knew he sounded as
if he were trying to convince himself. I could have given warning, too, if I’d talked with the wolves.
They knew there were Trollocs and Fades in the mountains. They were trying to tell me. But he
wondered: If he did not keep the wolves out of his mind, might he not be running with them now?
There had been a man, Elyas Machera, who also could talk to wolves. Elyas ran with the wolves all
the time, yet seemed able to remember he was a man. But he had never told Perrin how he did it, and
Perrin had not seen him in a long time.
The crunch of boots on rock announced two people coming, and a swirl of air carried their
scents to Perrin. He was careful not to speak names, though, until Lan and Moiraine were close
enough for even ordinary eyes to make them out.
The Warder had a hand under the Aes Sedai’s arm, as if trying to support her without letting her
know it. Moiraine’s eyes were haggard, and she carried a small, age-dark ivory carving of a woman
in one hand. Perrin knew it for an angreal, a remnant from the Age of Legends that allowed an Aes
Sedai to safely channel more of the Power than she could alone. It was a measure of her tiredness that
she was using it for Healing.
Min got to her feet to help Moiraine, but the Aes Sedai motioned her away. “Everyone else is
seen to,” she told Min. “When I am done here, I can rest.” She shook off Lan as well, and a look of
concentration appeared on her face as she traced a cool hand across Perrin’s bleeding shoulder, then
along the wound on his back. Her touch made his skin tingle. “This is not too bad,” she said. “The
bruising of your shoulder goes deep, but the gashes are shallow. Brace yourself. This will not hurt,
but. . . .”
He had never found it easy being near someone he knew was channeling the One Power, and still
less if it actually involved him. Yet there had been one or two of those times, and he thought he had
some idea what the channeling entailed, but those Healings had been minor, simply washing away
tiredness when Moiraine could not afford to have him weary. They had been nothing like this.
The Aes Sedai’s eyes suddenly seemed to be seeing inside him, seeing through him. He gasped
and almost dropped his axe. He could feel the skin on his back crawling, muscles writhing as they
knit back together. His shoulder quivered uncontrollably, and everything blurred. Cold seared him to
the bone, then deeper still. He had the impression of moving, falling, flying; he could not tell which,
but he felt as if he were rushing—somewhere, somehow—at great speed, forever. After an eternity
the world came into focus again. Moiraine was stepping back, half staggering until Lan caught her
arm.
Gaping, Perrin looked down at his shoulder. The gashes and bruises were gone; not so much as a
twinge remained. He twisted carefully, but the pain in his back had vanished as well. And his feet no
longer hurt; he did not need to look to know all the bruises and scrapes were gone. His stomach

rumbled loudly.
“You should eat as soon as you can,” Moiraine told him. “A good bit of the strength for that
came from you. You need to replace it.”
Hunger—and images of food—were already filling Perrin’s head. Blood rare beef, and venison,
and mutton, and. . . . With an effort he made himself stop thinking of meat. He would find some of
those roots that smelled like turnips when they were roasted. His stomach growled in protest.
“There’s barely even a scar, blacksmith,” Lan said behind him.
“Most of the wolves who were hurt made their own way to the forest,” Moiraine said, knuckling
her back and stretching, “but I Healed those I could find.” Perrin gave her a sharp look, yet she
seemed to be just making conversation. “Perhaps they came for their own reasons, yet we would
likely all be dead without them.” Perrin shifted uneasily and dropped his eyes.
The Aes Sedai reached toward the bruise on Min’s cheek, but Min stepped back, saying, “I’m
not really hurt, and you’re tired. I’ve had worse falling over my own feet.”
Moiraine smiled and let her hand fall. Lan took her arm; she swayed in his grip. “Very well. And
what of you, Rand? Did you take any hurt? Even a nick from a Myrddraal’s blade can be deadly, and
some Trolloc blades are almost as bad.”
Perrin noticed something for the first time. “Rand, your coat is wet.”
Rand pulled his right hand from under his coat, a hand covered in blood. “Not a Myrddraal,” he
said absently, peering at his hand. “Not even a Trolloc. The wound I took at Falme broke open.”
Moiraine hissed and jerked her arm free from Lan, half fell to her knees beside Rand. Pulling
back the side of his coat, she studied his wound. Perrin could not see it, for her head was in the way,
but the smell of blood was stronger, now. Moiraine’s hands moved, and Rand grimaced in pain. “
‘The blood of the Dragon Reborn on the rocks of Shayol Ghul will free mankind from the Shadow.’
Isn’t that what the Prophecies of the Dragon say?”
“Who told you that?” Moiraine said sharply.
“If you could get me to Shayol Ghul now,” Rand said drowsily, “by Waygate or Portal Stone,
there could be an end to it. No more dying. No more dreams. No more.”
“If it were as simple as that,” Moiraine said grimly, “I would, one way or another, but not all in
The Karaethon Cycle can be taken at its face. For every thing it says straight out, there are ten that
could mean a hundred different things. Do not think you know anything at all of what must be, even if
someone has told you the whole of the Prophecies.” She paused, as if gathering strength. Her grip
tightened on the angreal, and her free hand slid along Rand’s side as if it were not covered in blood.
“Brace yourself.”
Suddenly Rand’s eyes opened wide, and he sat straight up, gasping and staring and shivering.
Perrin had thought, when she Healed him, that it went on forever, but in moments she was easing Rand
back against the oak.
“I have . . . done as much as I can,” she said faintly. “As much as I can. You must be careful. It
could break open again if. . . .” As her voice trailed off, she fell.
Rand caught her, but Lan was there in an instant to scoop her up. As the Warder did so, a look
passed across his face, a look as close to tenderness as Perrin ever expected to see from Lan.
“Exhausted,” the Warder said. “She has cared for everyone else, but there’s no one to take her
fatigue. I will put her to bed.”
“There’s Rand,” Min said slowly, but the Warder shook his head.
“It isn’t that I do not think you would try, sheepherder,” he said, “but you know so little you
might as soon kill her as help her.”

“That’s right,” Rand said bitterly. “I’m not to be trusted. Lews Therin Kinslayer killed everyone
close to him. Maybe I’ll do the same before I am done.”
“Pull yourself together, sheepherder,” Lan said harshly. “The whole world rides on your
shoulders. Remember you’re a man, and do what needs to be done.”
Rand looked up at the Warder, and surprisingly, all of his bitterness seemed to be gone. “I will
fight the best I can,” he said. “Because there’s no one else, and it has to be done, and the duty is mine.
I’ll fight, but I do not have to like what I’ve become.” He closed his eyes as if going to sleep. “I will
fight. Dreams. . . .”
Lan stared down at him a moment, then nodded. He raised his head to look across Moiraine at
Perrin and Min. “Get him to his bed, then see to some sleep yourselves. We have plans to make, and
the Light alone knows what happens next.”

CHAPTER
6

The Hunt Begins

Perrin did not expect to sleep, but a stomach stuffed with cold stew—his resolve about the
roots had lasted until the smells of supper’s leftovers hit his nose—and bone weariness pulled him
down on his bed. If he dreamed, he did not remember. He awoke to Lan shaking his shoulders, dawn
through the open door turning the Warder to a shadow haloed with light.
“Rand is gone,” was all Lan said before he left at a run, but it was more than enough.
Perrin dragged himself up yawning and dressed quickly in the early chill. Outside, only a handful
of Shienarans were in sight, using their horses to drag Trolloc bodies into the woods, and most of
those moved as if they should be in a sickbed. A body took time to build back the strength that being
Healed took.
Perrin’s stomach muttered at him, and his nose tested the breeze in the hope that someone had
already started cooking. He was ready to eat those turnip-like roots, raw if need be. There were only
the lingering stench of slain Myrddraal, the smells of dead Trollocs and men, alive and dead, of
horses and the trees. And dead wolves.
Moiraine’s hut, high on the other side of the bowl, seemed a center of activity. Min hurried
inside, and moments later Masema came out, then Uno. At a trot the one-eyed man vanished into the
trees, toward the sheer rock wall beyond the hut, while the other Shienaran limped down the slope.
Perrin started toward the hut. As he splashed across the shallow stream, he met Masema. The
Shienaran’s face was haggard, the scar on his cheek prominent, and his eyes even more sunken than
usual. In the middle of the stream, he raised his head suddenly and caught Perrin’s coat sleeve.
“You’re from his village,” Masema said hoarsely. “You must know. Why did the Lord Dragon
abandon us? What sin did we commit?”
“Sin? What are you talking about? Whyever Rand went, it was nothing you did or didn’t do.”
Masema did not appear satisfied; he kept his grip on Perrin’s sleeve, peering into his face as if there
were answers there. Icy water began to seep into Perrin’s left boot. “Masema,” he said carefully,
“whatever the Lord Dragon did, it was according to his plan. The Lord Dragon would not abandon
us.” Or would he? If I were in his place, would I?
Masema nodded slowly. “Yes. Yes, I see that, now. He has gone out alone to spread the word of
his coming. We must spread the word, too. Yes.” He limped on across the stream, muttering to
himself.
Squelching at every other step, Perrin climbed to Moiraine’s hut and knocked. There was no
answer. He hesitated a moment, then went in.
The outer room, where Lan slept, was as stark and simple as Perrin’s own hut, with a rough bed
built against one wall, a few pegs for hanging possessions, and a single shelf. Not much light entered
through the open door, and the only other illumination came from crude lamps on the shelf, slivers of

oily fat-wood wedged into cracks in pieces of rock. They gave off thin streamers of smoke that made
a layer of haze under the roof. Perrin’s nose wrinkled at the smell.
The low roof was only a little higher than his head. Loial’s head actually brushed it, even seated
as he was on one end of Lan’s bed, with his knees drawn up to make himself small. The Ogier’s tufted
ears twitched uneasily. Min sat cross-legged on the dirt floor beside the door that led to Moiraine’s
room, while the Aes Sedai paced back and forth in thought. Dark thoughts, they must have been. Three
paces each way was all she had, but she made vigorous use of the space, the calm on her face belied
by the quickness of her step.
“I think Masema is going crazy,” Perrin said.
Min sniffed. “With him, how can you tell?”
Moiraine rounded on him, a tightness to her mouth. Her voice was soft. Too soft. “Is Masema the
most important thing in your mind this morning, Perrin Aybara?”
“No. I’d like to know when Rand left, and why. Did anyone see him go? Does anyone know
where he went?” He made himself meet her look with one just as level and firm. It was not easy. He
loomed over her, but she was Aes Sedai. “Is this of your making, Moiraine? Did you rein him in until
he was so impatient he’d go anywhere, do anything, just to stop sitting still?” Loial’s ears went stiff,
and he motioned a surreptitious warning with one thick-fingered hand.
Moiraine studied Perrin with her head tilted to one side, and it was all he could do not to drop
his eyes. “This is none of my doing,” she said. “He left sometime during the night. When and how and
why, I yet hope to learn.”
Loial’s shoulders heaved in a quiet sigh of relief. Quiet for an Ogier, it sounded like steam
rushing out from quenching red-hot iron. “Never anger an Aes Sedai,” he said in a whisper obviously
meant just for himself, but audible to everyone. “ ‘Better to embrace the sun than to anger an Aes
Sedai.’ ”
Min reached up enough to hand Perrin a folded piece of paper. “Loial went to see him after we
got him to bed last night, and Rand asked to borrow pen and paper and ink.”
The Ogier’s ears jerked, and he frowned worriedly until his long eyebrows hung down on his
cheeks. “I did not know what he was planning. I didn’t.”
“We know that,” Min said. “No one is accusing you of anything, Loial.”
Moiraine frowned at the paper, but she did not try to stop Perrin from reading. It was in Rand’s
hand.
What I do, I do because there is no other way. He is hunting me again, and this time one of us
has to die, I think. There is no need for those around me to die, also. Too many have died for
me already. I do not want to die either, and will not, if I can manage it. There are lies in
dreams, and death, but dreams hold truth, too.
That was all, with no signature. There was no need for Perrin to wonder who Rand meant by
“he.” For Rand, for all of them, there could be only one. Ba’alzamon.
“He left that tucked under the door there,” Min said in a tight voice. “He took some old clothes
the Shienarans had hanging out to dry, and his flute, and a horse. Nothing else but a little food, as far
as we can tell. None of the guards saw him go, and last night they would have seen a mouse
creeping.”
“And would it have done any good if they had?” Moiraine said calmly. “Would any of them have
stopped the Lord Dragon, or even challenged him? Some of them—Masema for one—would slit their
own throats if the Lord Dragon told them to.”

It was Perrin’s turn to study her. “Did you expect anything else? They swore to follow him.
Light, Moiraine, he’d never have named himself Dragon if not for you. What did you expect of them?”
She did not speak, and he went on more quietly. “Do you believe, Moiraine? That he’s really the
Dragon Reborn? Or do you just think he’s someone you can use before the One Power kills him or
drives him mad?”
“Go easy, Perrin,” Loial said. “Not so angry.”
“I’ll go easy when she answers me. Well, Moiraine?”
“He is what he is,” she said sharply.
“You said the Pattern would force him to the right path eventually. Is that what this is, or is he
just trying to get away from you?” For a moment he thought he had gone too far—her dark eyes
sparkled with anger—but he refused to back down. “Well?”
Moiraine took a deep breath. “This may well be what the Pattern has chosen, yet I did not mean
for him to go off alone. For all his power, he is as defenseless as a babe in many ways, and as
ignorant of the world. He channels, but he has no control over whether or not the One Power comes
when he reaches for it and almost as little over what he does with it if it does come. The power itself
will kill him before he has a chance to go mad if he does not learn that control. There is so much he
must learn, yet. He wants to run before he has learned to walk.”
“You split hairs and lay false trails, Moiraine.” Perrin snorted. “If he is what you say he is, did
it never occur to you that he might know what he has to do better than you?”
“He is what he is,” she repeated firmly, “but I must keep him alive if he is to do anything. He
will fulfill no prophecies dead, and even if he manages to avoid Darkfriends and Shadowspawn,
there are a thousand other hands ready to slay him. All it will take is a hint of the hundredth part of
what he is. Yet if that were all he might face, I would not worry half so much as I do. There are the
Forsaken to be accounted for.”
Perrin gave a start; from the corner, Loial moaned. “ ‘The Dark One and all the Forsaken are
bound in Shayol Ghul,’ ” Perrin began by rote, but she gave him no time to finish.
“The seals are weakening, Perrin. Some are broken, though the world does not know that. Must
not know that. The Father of Lies is not free. Yet. But as the seals weaken, more and more, which of
the Forsaken may be loosed already? Lanfear? Sammael? Asmodean, or Be’lal, or Ravhin? Ishamael
himself, the Betrayer of Hope? They were thirteen altogether, Perrin, and bound in the sealing, not in
the prison that holds the Dark One. Thirteen of the most powerful Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends,
the weakest of them stronger than the ten strongest Aes Sedai living today, the most ignorant with all
the knowledge of the Age of Legends. And every man and woman of them gave up the Light and
dedicated their souls to the Shadow. What if they are free, and out there waiting for him? I will not let
them have him.”
Perrin shivered, partly from the icy iron in her last words, and partly from thought of the
Forsaken. He did not want to think of even one of the Forsaken loose in the world. His mother had
frightened him with those names when he was little. Ishamael comes for boys who do not tell their
mothers the truth. Lanfear waits in the night for boys who do not go to bed when they are supposed
to. Being older did not help, not when he knew now they were all real. Not when Moiraine said they
might be free.
“Bound in Shayol Ghul,” he whispered, and wished he still believed it. Troubled, he studied
Rand’s letter again. “Dreams. He was talking about dreams yesterday, too.”
Moiraine stepped closer, and peered up into his face. “Dreams?” Lan and Uno came in, but she
waved them to silence. The small room was more than crowded now, with five people in it besides

the Ogier. “What dreams have you had the last few days, Perrin?” She ignored his protest that there
was nothing wrong with his dreams. “Tell me,” she insisted. “What dream have you had that was not
ordinary? Tell me.” Her gaze seized him like smithy tongs, willing him to speak.
He looked at the others—they were all watching him fixedly, even Min—then hesitantly told of
the one dream that seemed unusual to him, the dream that came every night. The dream of the sword
he could not touch. He did not mention the wolf that had appeared in the last.
“Callandor,” Lan breathed when he was done. Rock-hard face or no, he looked stunned.
“Yes,” Moiraine said, “but we must be absolutely certain. Speak to the others.” As Lan hurried
out, she turned to Uno. “And what of your dreams? Did you dream of a sword, too?”
The Shienaran shifted his feet. The red eye painted on his patch stared straight at Moiraine, but
his real eye blinked and wavered. “I dream about flam—uh, about swords all the time, Moiraine
Sedai,” he said stiffly. “I suppose I’ve dreamed about a sword the last few nights. I don’t remember
my dreams the way Lord Perrin here does.”
Moiraine said, “Loial?”
“My dreams are always the same, Moiraine Sedai. The groves, and the Great Trees, and the
stedding. We Ogier always dream of the stedding when we are away from them.”
The Aes Sedai turned back to Perrin.
“It was just a dream,” he said. “Nothing but a dream.”
“I doubt it,” she said. “You describe the hall called the Heart of the Stone, in the fortress called
the Stone of Tear, as if you had stood in it. And the shining sword is Callandor, the Sword That Is
Not a Sword, the Sword That Cannot Be Touched.”
Loial sat up straight, bumping his head on the roof. He did not seem to notice. “The Prophecies
of the Dragon say the Stone of Tear will never fall till Callandor is wielded by the Dragon’s hand.
The fall of the Stone of Tear will be one of the greatest signs of the Dragon’s Rebirth. If Rand holds
Callandor, the whole world must acknowledge him as the Dragon.”
“Perhaps.” The word floated from the Aes Sedai’s lips like a shard of ice on still water.
“Perhaps?” Perrin said. “Perhaps? I thought that was the final sign, the last thing to fulfill your
Prophecies.”
“Neither the first nor the last,” Moiraine said. “Callandor will be but one fulfillment of The
Karaethon Cycle, as his birth on the slopes of Dragonmount was the first. He has yet to break the
nations, or shatter the world. Even scholars who have studied the Prophecies for their entire lives do
not know how to interpret them all. What does it mean that he ‘shall slay his people with the sword of
peace, and destroy them with the leaf’? What does it meant that he ‘shall bind the nine moons to serve
him’? Yet these are given equal weight with Callandor in the Cycle. There are others. What ‘wounds
of madness and cutting of hope’ has he healed? What chains has he broken, and who put into chains?
And some are so obscure that he may already have fulfilled them, although I am not aware of it. But,
no. Callandor is far from the end of it.”
Perrin shrugged uneasily. He knew only bits and pieces of the Prophecies; he had liked hearing
them even less since Rand had let Moiraine put that banner in his hands. No, it had been before that,
even. Since a journey by Portal Stone had convinced him his life was bound to Rand’s.
Moiraine was continuing. “If you think he has simply to put out his hand, Loial son of Arent son
of Halan, you are a fool, as is he if he thinks it. Even if he lives to reach Tear, he may never attain the
Stone.
“Tairens have no love for the One Power, and less for any man claiming to be the Dragon.
Channeling is outlawed, and Aes Sedai are tolerated at best, so long as they do not channel. Telling

the Prophecies of the Dragon, or even possessing a copy of them, is enough to put you in prison, in
Tear. And no one enters the Stone of Tear without permission of the High Lords; none but the High
Lords themselves enter the Heart of the Stone. He is not ready for this. Not ready.”
Perrin grunted softly. The Stone would never fall till the Dragon Reborn held Callandor. How in
the Light is he supposed to reach it—inside a bloody fortress!—before the fortress falls? It is
madness!
“Why are we just sitting here?” Min burst out. “If Rand is going to Tear, why aren’t we
following him? He could be killed, or . . . or. . . . Why are we sitting here?”
Moiraine put a hand on Min’s head. “Because I must be sure,” she said gently. “It is not
comfortable being chosen by the Wheel, to be great or to be near greatness. The chosen of the Wheel
can only take what comes.”
“I am tired of taking what comes.” Min scrubbed a hand across her eyes. Perrin thought he saw
tears. “Rand could be dying while we wait.” Moiraine smoothed Min’s hair; there was a look almost
of pity on the Aes Sedai’s face.
Perrin sat down on the end of Lan’s bed opposite Loial. The smell of people was thick in the
room—people and worry and fear; Loial smelled of books and trees as well as worry. It felt like a
trap, with the walls around them, and all so close. The burning slivers stank. “How can my dream tell
where Rand is going?” he asked. “It was my dream.”
“Those who can channel the One Power,” Moiraine said quietly, “those who are particularly
strong in Spirit, can sometimes force their dreams on others.” She did not stop her soothing of Min.
“Especially on those who are—susceptible. I do not believe Rand did it on purpose, but the dreams
of those touching the True Source can be powerful. For one as strong as he, they could possibly seize
an entire village, or perhaps even a city. He knows little of what he does, and even less of how to
control it.”
“Then why didn’t you have it, too?” he demanded. “Or Lan.” Uno stared straight ahead, looking
as if he would rather be anywhere else, and Loial’s ears wilted. Perrin was too tired and too hungry
to care whether he showed proper respect for an Aes Sedai. And too angry, as well, he realized.
“Why?”
Moiraine answered calmly. “Aes Sedai learn to shield their dreams. I do it without thinking,
when I sleep. Warders are given something much the same in the bonding. The Gaidin could not do
what they must if the Shadow could steal into their dreams. We are all vulnerable when we sleep, and
the Shadow is strong in the night.”
“There’s always something new from you,” Perrin growled. “Can’t you tell us what to expect
once in a while, instead of explaining after it happens?” Uno looked as though he was trying to think
of a reason to leave.
Moiraine gave Perrin a flat look. “You want me to share a lifetime of knowledge with you in a
single afternoon? Or even a single year? I will tell you this. Be wary of dreams, Perrin Aybara. Be
very wary of dreams.”
He pulled his eyes away from hers. “I am,” he murmured. “I am.”
After that, silence, and no one seemed to want to break it. Min sat staring at her crossed ankles,
but apparently taking some comfort from Moiraine’s presence. Uno stood against the wall, not looking
at anyone. Loial forgot himself enough to pull a book from his coat pocket and try to read in the dim
light. The wait was long, and far from easy for Perrin. It’s not the Shadow in my dreams I’m afraid
of. It’s wolves. I will not let them in. I won’t!
Lan returned, and Moiraine straightened eagerly. The Warder answered the question in her eyes.

“Half of them remember dreaming of swords the last four nights running. Some remember a place
with great columns, and five say the sword was crystal, or glass. Masema says he saw Rand holding
it last night.”
“That one would,” Moiraine said. She rubbed her hands together briskly; she seemed suddenly
full of energy. “Now I am certain. Though I still wish I knew how he left here unseen. If he has
rediscovered some Talent from the Age of Legends. . . .”
Lan looked at Uno, and the one-eyed man shrugged in dismay. “I bloody forgot, with all this
flaming talk about bloo—” He cleared his throat, shooting a glance at Moiraine. She looked back
expectantly, and he went on. “I mean . . . uh . . . that is, I followed the Lord Dragon’s tracks. There’s
another way into that closed valley, now. The . . . the earthquake brought down the far wall. It’s a
hard climb, but you can get a horse up it. I found more tracks at the top, and there’s an easy way from
there around the mountain.” He let out a long breath when he was done.
“Good,” Moiraine said. “At least he has not rediscovered how to fly, or make himself invisible,
or something else out of legend. We must follow him without delay. Uno, I will give you enough gold
to take you and the others as far as Jehannah, and the name of someone there who will see that you get
more. The Ghealdanin are wary of strangers, but if you keep to yourselves, they should not trouble
you. Wait there until I send word.”
“But we will go with you,” he protested. “We have all sworn to follow the Dragon Reborn. I do
not see how the few of us can take a fortress that has never fallen, but with the Lord Dragon’s aid, we
will do what must be done.”
“So we are ‘the People of the Dragon,’ now.” Perrin laughed mirthlessly. “ ‘The Stone of Tear
will never fall till the People of the Dragon come.’ Have you given us a new name, Moiraine?”
“Watch your tongue, blacksmith,” Lan growled, all ice and stone.
Moiraine gave them both sharp looks, and they fell silent. “Forgive me, Uno,” she said, “but we
must travel quickly if we are to have a hope of overtaking him. You are the only Shienaran fit enough
for a hard ride, and we cannot afford the days the others will need to regain full strength. I will send
for you when I can.”
Uno grimaced, but he bowed in acquiescence. At her dismissal, he squared his shoulders and left
to tell the others.
“Well, I am going along, whatever you say,” Min put in firmly.
“You are going to Tar Valon,” Moiraine told her.
“I am no such thing!”
The Aes Sedai went on smoothly as if the other woman had not spoken. “The Amyrlin Seat must
be told what has happened, and I cannot count on finding one I can trust who has messenger pigeons.
Or that the Amyrlin will see any message I send by pigeon. It is a long journey, and hard. I would not
send you alone if there were anyone to send with you, but I will see you have money, and letters to
those who might help you on your way. You must ride quickly, though. When your horse tires, buy
another—or steal one, if you must—but ride quickly.”
“Let Uno take your message. He’s fit; you said so. I am going after Rand.”
“Uno has his duties, Min. And do you think a man could simply walk up to the gates of the White
Tower and demand an audience with the Amyrlin Seat? Even a king would be made to wait days if he
arrived unannounced, and I fear any of the Shienarans would be left kicking their heels for weeks, if
not forever. Not to mention that something so unusual would be known to everyone in Tar Valon
before the first sunset. Few women seek audiences with the Amyrlin herself, but it does happen, and it
should occasion no great comment. No one must learn even as much as that the Amyrlin Seat has

received a message from me. Her life—and ours—could depend on it. You are the one who must go.”
Min sat there opening and closing her mouth, obviously searching for another argument, but
Moiraine had already gone on. “Lan, I very much fear we will find more evidence of his passing than
I would like, but I will rely on your tracking.” The Warder nodded. “Perrin? Loial? Will you come
with me after Rand?” From her place against the wall, Min gave an indignant squawk, but the Aes
Sedai ignored it.
“I will come,” Loial said quickly. “Rand is my friend. And I will admit it; I would not miss
anything. For my book, you see.”
Perrin was slower to answer. Rand was his friend, whatever he had become in the forging. And
there was that near certainty of their futures being linked, though he would have avoided that part of it
if he could. “It has to be done, doesn’t it?” he said finally. “I will come.”
“Good.” Moiraine rubbed her hands together again, with the air of someone settling to work.
“You must all ready yourselves at once. Rand has hours on us. I mean to be well along his trail before
midday.”
Slender as she was, the force of her presence herded all of them but Lan toward the door, Loial
walking stooped over until he was through the doorway. Perrin thought of a goodwife herding geese.
Once outside, Min hung back for a moment to address Lan with a too-sweet smile. “And is there
any message you want carried? To Nynaeve, perhaps?”
The Warder blinked as if caught off guard, like a horse on three legs. “Does everyone know—?”
He regained his balance almost immediately. “If there is anything else she needs to hear from me, I
will tell her myself.” He closed the door nearly in her face.
“Men!” Min muttered at the door. “Too blind to see what a stone could see, and too stubborn to
be trusted to think for themselves.”
Perrin inhaled deeply. Faint smells of death still hung in the valley air, but it was better than the
closeness inside. Some better.
“Clean air,” Loial sighed. “The smoke was beginning to bother me a little.”
They started down the slope together. Beside the stream below, the Shienarans who could stand
were gathered around Uno. From his gestures the one-eyed man was making up for lost time with his
cursing.
“How did you two become privileged?” Min demanded abruptly. “She asked you. She didn’t do
me the courtesy of asking.”
Loial shook his head. “I think she asked because she knew what we would answer, Min.
Moiraine seems able to read Perrin and me; she knows what we’ll do. But you are a closed book to
her.”
Min appeared only a little mollified. She looked up at them, Perrin head and shoulders taller on
one side and Loial towering even higher on the other. “Much good it does me. I am still going where
she wants as easily as you two little lambs. You were doing well for a while, Perrin. Standing up to
her like she’d sold you a coat and the seams were popping open.”
“I did stand up to her, didn’t I,” Perrin said wonderingly. He had not really realized he had done
that. “It was not so bad as I’d have thought it would be.”
“You were lucky,” Loial rumbled. “ ‘To anger an Aes Sedai is to put your head in a hornet’s
nest.’ ”
“Loial,” Min said, “I need to speak to Perrin. Alone. Would you mind?”
“Oh. Of course not.” He lengthened his stride to its normal span and quickly moved ahead of
them, pulling his pipe and tabac pouch from a coat pocket.

Perrin eyed her warily. She was biting her lip, as if considering what to say. “Do you ever see
things about him?” he asked, nodding after the Ogier.
She shook her head. “I think it only works with humans. But I’ve seen things around you that you
ought to know about.”
“I’ve told you—”
“Don’t be more thickheaded than you have to be, Perrin. Back there, right after you said you’d
go. They were not there before. They must have to do with this journey. Or at least with you deciding
to go.”
After a moment he said reluctantly, “What did you see?”
“An Aielman in a cage,” she said promptly. “A Tuatha’an with a sword. A falcon and a hawk,
perching on your shoulders. Both female, I think. And all the rest, of course. What is always there.
Darkness swirling ’round you, and—”
“None of that!” he said quickly. When he was sure she had stopped, he scratched his head,
thinking. None of it made any sense to him. “Do you have any idea what it all means? The new things,
I mean.”
“No, but they’re important. The things I see always are. Turning points in people’s lives, or
what’s fated. It’s always important.” She hesitated for a moment, glancing at him. “One more thing,”
she said slowly. “If you meet a woman—the most beautiful woman you’ve ever seen—run!”
Perrin blinked. “You saw a beautiful woman? Why should I run from a beautiful woman?”
“Can’t you just take advice?” she said irritably. She kicked at a stone and watched it roll down
the slope.
Perrin did not like jumping to conclusions—it was one of the reasons some people thought him
slow-witted—but he totaled up a number of things Min had said in the last few days and came to a
startling conclusion. He stopped dead, hunting for words. “Uh . . . Min, you know I like you. I like
you, but. . . . Uh . . . you sort of remind me of my sisters. I mean, you. . . .” The flow stumbled to a halt
as she raised her head to look at him, eyebrows arched. She wore a small smile.
“Why, Perrin, you must know that I love you.” She stood there, watching his mouth work, then
spoke slowly and carefully. “Like a brother, you great wooden-headed lummox! The arrogance of
men never ceases to amaze me. You all think everything has to do with you, and every woman has to
desire you.”
Perrin felt his face growing hot. “I never. . . . I didn’t. . . .” He cleared his throat. “What did you
see about a woman?”
“Just take my advice,” she said, and started down toward the stream again, walking fast. “If you
forget all the rest,” she called over her shoulder, “heed that!”
He frowned after her—for once his thoughts seemed to arrange themselves quickly—then caught
up in two strides. “It’s Rand, isn’t it?”
She made a sound in her throat and gave him a sidelong look. She did not slow down, though.
“Maybe you aren’t so boneheaded after all,” she muttered. After a moment she added, as if to herself,
“I’m bound to him as surely as a stave is bound to the barrel. But I can’t see if he’ll ever love me in
return. And I am not the only one.”
“Does Egwene know?” he asked. Rand and Egwene had been all but promised since childhood.
Everything but kneeling in front of the Women’s Circle of the village to speak the betrothal. He was
not sure how far they had drifted from that, if at all.
“She knows,” Min said curtly. “Much good it does either of us.”
“What about Rand? Does he know?”

“Oh, of course,” she said bitterly. “I told him, didn’t I? ‘Rand, I did a viewing of you, and it
seems I have to fall in love with you. I have to share you, too, and I don’t much like that, but there it
is.’ You’re a wooden-headed wonder after all, Perrin Aybara.” She dashed a hand across her eyes
angrily. “If I could be with him, I know I could help. Somehow. Light, if he dies, I don’t know if I can
stand it.”
Perrin shrugged uncomfortably. “Listen, Min. I’ll do what I can to help him.” However much
that is. “I promise you that. It really is best for you to go to Tar Valon. You’ll be safe there.”
“Safe?” She tasted the word as if wondering what it meant. “You think Tar Valon is safe?”
“If there’s no safety in Tar Valon, there’s no safety anywhere.”
She sniffed loudly, and in silence they went to join those preparing to leave.

CHAPTER

The Way Out of the Mountains

The way down out of the mountains was hard, but the lower they went, the less Perrin needed
his fur-lined cloak. Hour by hour, they rode out of the tailings of winter and into the first days of
spring. The last remnants of snow vanished, and grasses and wildflowers—white maiden’s hope and
pink jump up—began to cover the high meadows they crossed. Trees appeared more often, with more
leaves, and grasslarks and robins sang in the branches. And there were wolves. Never in sight—not
even Lan mentioned seeing one—but Perrin knew. He kept his mind firmly closed to them, yet now
and again a feather-light tickle at the back of his mind reminded him they were there.
Lan spent most of his time scouting their path on his black warhorse, Mandarb, following Rand’s
tracks as the rest of them followed the signs the Warder left for them. An arrow of stones laid out on
the ground, or one lightly scratched in the rock wall of a forking pass. Turn this way. Cross that
saddlepass. Take this switchback, this deer trail, this way through the trees and down along a narrow
stream, even though there is nothing to indicate anyone has ever gone that way before. Nothing but
Lan’s signs. A tuft of grass or weeds tied one way to say bear left, another for bear right. A bent
branch. A pile of pebbles for a rough climb ahead, two leaves caught on a thorn for a steep descent.
The Warder had a hundred signs, it seemed to Perrin, and Moiraine knew them all. Lan rarely came
back except when they made camp, to confer with Moiraine quietly, away from the fire. When the sun
rose, most often he was hours gone already.
Moiraine was always first into the saddle after him, while the eastern sky was just turning pink.
The Aes Sedai would not have climbed down from Aldieb, her white mare, until full dark or later,
except that Lan refused to track further once the light began to fail.
“We’ll go even slower if a horse breaks a leg,” the Warder would tell Moiraine when she
complained.
Her reply was always very much the same. “If you cannot move any faster than this, perhaps I
should send you off to Myrelle before you get any older. Well, perhaps that can wait, but you must
move us faster.”
She half sounded as if the threat were irritated truth, half as if she were making a joke. There
was something of a threat in it, or maybe a warning, Perrin was sure, from the way Lan’s mouth
tightened even when she smiled afterwards and reached up to pat his shoulder soothingly.
“Who is Myrelle?” Perrin asked suspiciously, the first time it happened. Loial shook his head,
murmuring something about unpleasant things happening to those who pried into Aes Sedai affairs.
The Ogier’s hairy-fetlocked horse was as tall and heavy as a Dhurran stallion, but with Loial’s long
legs dangling to either side, the animal looked undersized, like a large pony.
Moiraine gave an amused, secretive smile. “Just a Green sister. Someone to whom Lan must one
day deliver a package for safekeeping.”

“No day soon,” Lan said, and surprisingly, there was open anger in his voice. “Never, if I can
help it. You will outlive me long, Moiraine Aes Sedai!”
She has too many secrets, Perrin thought, but asked no more about a subject that could crack the
Warder’s iron self-control.
The Aes Sedai had a blanket-wrapped bundle tied behind her saddle: the Dragon banner. Perrin
was uneasy about having it with them, but Moiraine had neither asked his opinion nor listened when
he offered it. Not that anyone was likely to recognize it if he saw it, yet he hoped she was as good at
keeping secrets from other people as she was at keeping them from him.
In the beginning, at least, it was a boring journey. One cloud-capped mountain was very much
like another, one pass little different from the next. Supper was usually rabbit, dropped by stones
from Perrin’s sling. He did not have so many arrows as to risk shooting at rabbits in that rocky
country. Breakfast was cold rabbit, more often than not, and the midday meal the same, eaten in the
saddle.
Sometimes when they camped near a stream and there was still light enough to see, he and Loial
caught mountain trout, lying on their bellies, hands elbow-deep in the cold water, tickling the greenbacked fish out from under the rock ledges where they hid. Loial’s fingers, big as they were, were
even more deft at it than Perrin’s.
Once, three days after setting out, Moiraine joined them, stretching herself out on the streamside
and undoing rows of pearl buttons to roll up her sleeves as she asked how the thing was done. Perrin
exchanged surprised looks with Loial. The Ogier shrugged.
“It is not that hard, really,” Perrin told her. “Just bring your hand up from behind the fish, and
underneath, as if you’re trying to tickle its belly. Then you pull it out. It takes practice, though. You
might not catch anything the first few times you try.”
“I tried for days before I ever caught anything,” Loial added. He was already easing his huge
hands into the water, careful to keep his shadow from scaring the fish.
“As difficult as that?” Moiraine murmured. Her hands slipped into the water—and a moment
later came out with a splash, holding a fat trout that thrashed the surface. She laughed with delight as
she tossed it up onto the bank.
Perrin blinked at the big fish flopping in the fading sunlight. It must have weighed at least five
pounds. “You were very lucky,” he said. “Trout that size don’t often shelter under a ledge this small.
We’ll have to move upstream a bit. It will be dark before any of them settle under this ledge again.”
“Is that so?” Moiraine said. “You two go ahead. I think I will just try here again.”
Perrin hesitated a moment before moving up the bank to another overhang. She was up to
something, but he could not imagine what. That troubled him. Belly down, and careful not to let his
shadow fall on the water, he peered over the edge. Half a dozen slender shapes hung suspended in the
water, barely moving a fin to hold their places. All of them together would not weigh as much as
Moiraine’s fish, he decided with a sigh. If they were lucky, he and Loial might take two apiece, but
the shadows of trees on the far bank already stretched across the water. Whatever they caught now
would be it, and Loial’s appetite was big enough by itself to swallow those four and most of the
bigger fish, too. Loial’s hands were already easing up behind one of the trout.
Before Perrin could even slide his hands into the water, Moiraine gave a shout. “Three should
be enough, I think. The last two are bigger than the first.”
Perrin gave Loial a startled look. “She can’t have!”
The Ogier straightened, sending the small trout scattering. “She is Aes Sedai,” he said simply.
Sure enough, when they returned to Moiraine, three big trout lay on the bank. She was already

buttoning her sleeves up again.
Perrin thought about reminding her that whoever took the fish was supposed to clean them, too,
but just at that moment she caught his eye. There was no particular expression on her smooth face, but
her dark eyes did not waver, and they appeared to know what he was going to say, and to have
dismissed it out of hand already. When she turned away, it seemed somehow too late to say anything.
Muttering to himself, Perrin pulled out his beltknife and set to the gutting and heading. “All of a
sudden she’s forgotten about sharing the chores, it seems. I suppose she’ll want us to do the cooking,
as well, and the cleaning up after.”
“No doubt she will,” Loial said without pausing over the fish he was working on. “She is Aes
Sedai.”
“I seem to remember hearing that somewhere.” Perrin’s knife ripped into the fish. “The
Shienarans might have been willing to run around fetching and carrying for her, but there are only four
of us now. We should keep on turn and turn about. It’s only fair.”
Loial gave a great snort of laughter. “I doubt she sees it that way. First she had to put up with
Rand arguing with her all the time, and now you’re ready to take over for him. As a rule, Aes Sedai
do not let anyone argue with them. I expect she means to have us back in the habit of doing what she
says by the time we reach the first village.”
“A good habit to be in,” Lan said, throwing back his cloak. In the fading light he had appeared
out of nowhere.
Perrin nearly fell over from surprise, and Loial’s ears went stiff with shock. Neither of them had
heard the Warder’s step.
“A habit you should never have lost,” Lan added, then strode off toward Moiraine and the
horses. His boots barely made a sound, even on that rocky ground, and once he was a few paces away
the cloak hanging down his back gave him the uneasy appearance of a disembodied head and arms
drifting up from the stream.
“We need her to find Rand,” Perrin said softly, “but I am not going to let her shape my life
anymore.” He went back to his cleaning vigorously.
He meant to keep that promise—he really did—but during the days that followed, in some way
he did not quite understand, he found that he and Loial were doing the cooking, and the cleaning up,
and any other little chore that Moiraine thought of. He even discovered that somehow or other he had
taken over tending Aldieb every night, unsaddling the mare and rubbing her down while Moiraine
settled herself, apparently deep in thought.
Loial gave in to it as inevitable, but not Perrin. He tried refusing, resisting, but it was hard to
resist when she made a reasonable suggestion, and a small one at that. Only there was always another
suggestion behind it, as reasonable and small as the first, and then another. The simple force of her
presence, the strength of her gaze, made it difficult to protest. Her dark eyes would catch his at the
moment he opened his mouth. A lift of her eyebrow to suggest he was being rude, a surprised
widening of her eyes that he could object to so small a request, a level stare that held in it everything
that was Aes Sedai, all these things could make him hesitate, and once he hesitated there was never
any recovering lost ground. He accused her of using the One Power on him, though he did not really
think that was it, and she told him not to be a fool. He began to feel like a piece of iron trying to stop a
smith from hammering it into a scythe.
The Mountains of Mist gave way abruptly to the forested foothills of Ghealdan, to land that
seemed all up and down, but never very high. Deer, which in the mountains had often watched them
warily, as if uncertain what a man was, began to bound away, white tails flickering, at the first sight

of the horses. Even Perrin now caught only the faintest glimpses of the gray-striped mountain cats that
seemed to fade away like smoke. They were coming into the lands of men.
Lan stopped wearing his color-shifting cloak and began riding back to the rest of them more
often, telling them what lay ahead. In many places the trees had all been cut down. Soon, fields
encircled by rough stone walls and farmers plowing ’round the sides of hills were common sights, if
not exactly frequent, along with lines of people moving across the plowed ground, sowing seed from
sacks slung from their shoulders. Scattered farmhouses and barns of gray stone sat on hilltops and
ridges.
The wolves should not have been there. Wolves avoided places where men were, but Perrin
could still sense them, an unseen screen and escort ringing the mounted party. Impatience filled him;
impatience to reach a village or a town, any place where there were enough men to make the wolves
go away.
A day after sighting the first field, just as the sun touched the horizon behind them, they came to
the village of Jarra, not far north of the border with Amadicia.

Gray stone houses with slate roofs lay clustered along the few narrow streets of Jarra, clinging
to a hillside above a little stream spanned by a low wooden bridge. The muddy streets were empty,
and so was the sloping village green, except for one man sweeping the steps of the village’s only inn,
standing beside its stone stable; but it looked as if there had been a good many people on the green not
long before. Half a dozen arches, woven of green branches and dotted with such few flowers as could
be found this early in the year, stood in a circle in the middle of the grass. The ground had a trampled
look, and there were other signs of a gathering; a woman’s red scarf lying tangled at the foot of one of
the arches, a child’s knitted cap, a pewter pitcher tumbled on its side, a few half-eaten scraps of food.
The aromas of sweet wine and spiced cakes clung about the green, mixed in with smoke from
dozens of chimneys and evening meals cooking. For an instant Perrin’s nose caught another odor, one
he could not identify, a faint trail that raised the hair on the back of his neck with its vileness. Then it
was gone. But he was sure something had passed that way, something—wrong. He scrubbed at his
nose as if to rub away the memory of it. That can’t be Rand. Light, even if he has gone mad, that
can’t be him. Can it?
A painted sign hung above the inn door, a man standing on one foot with his arms thrown in the
air: Harilin’s Leap. As they drew rein in front of the square stone building, the sweeper straightened,
yawning fiercely. He gave a start at Perrin’s eyes, but his own already protruding eyes went wide
when they fell on Loial. With his wide mouth and no chin to speak of, he looked something like a frog.
There was an old smell of sour wine about him—to Perrin, at least. The fellow had certainly been
part of the celebration.
The man gave himself a shake, and turned it into a bow with one hand resting on the double row
of wooden buttons running down his coat. His eyes flickered from one to another of them, popping
even more every time they rested on Loial. “Welcome, good mistress, and the Light illumine your
way. Welcome, good masters. You wish food, rooms, baths? All to be had, here at the Leap. Master
Harod, the innkeeper, keeps a good house. I am called Simion. If you wish anything, ask for Simion,
and he will get it for you.” He yawned again, covering his mouth in embarrassment and bowing to
hide it. “I beg your pardon, good mistress. You have come far? Have you word of the Great Hunt?
The Hunt for the Horn of Valere? Or the false Dragon? It’s said there’s a false Dragon in Tarabon. Or
maybe Arad Doman.”
“We have not come that far,” Lan said, swinging down from his saddle. “No doubt you know
more than I.” They all began dismounting.
“You have had a wedding here?” Moiraine said.
“A wedding, good mistress? Why, we’ve had a lifetime of weddings. A plague of them. All in
the last two days. There isn’t a woman old enough to speak the betrothal remains unmarried, not in the

whole village, not for a mile in any direction. Why, even Widow Jorath dragged old Banas through
the arches, and they’d both sworn they’d never marry again. It was like a whirlwind just snatched
everybody up. Rilith, the weaver’s daughter, she started it, asking Jon the blacksmith to marry her,
and him old enough to be her father and more. The old fool just took off his apron and said yes, and
she demanded the arches be put up right then and there. Wouldn’t hear of a proper wait, and all the
other women sided with her. Since then we’ve had marriages day and night. Why, nobody’s had any
sleep at all hardly.”
“That’s very interesting,” Perrin said when Simion paused to yawn again, “but have you seen a
young—”
“It is very interesting,” Moiraine said, cutting him off, “and I would hear more of it later,
perhaps. For now, we would like rooms, and a meal.” Lan made a small gesture toward Perrin, down
low, as if telling him to hold his tongue.
“Of course, good mistress. A meal. Rooms.” Simion hesitated, eyeing Loial. “We’ll have to push
two beds together for—” He leaned closer to Moiraine and dropped his voice. “Pardon, good
mistress, but—uh—what exactly—is he? Meaning no disrespect,” he added hastily.
He had not spoken softly enough, for Loial’s ears twitched irritably. “I am an Ogier! What did
you think I was? A Trolloc?”
Simion took a step back at the booming voice. “Trolloc, good—uh—master? Why, I’m a grown
man. I don’t believe in children’s tales. Uh, did you say Ogier? Why, Ogier are childr—I mean . . .
that is. . . .” In desperation, he turned to bellow toward the stable next to the inn. “Nico! Patrim!
Visitors! Come see to their horses!” After a moment two boys with hay in their hair tumbled out of the
stable, yawning and rubbing their eyes. Simion gestured to the steps, bowing, as the boys gathered
reins.
Perrin slung his saddlebags and blanketroll over his shoulder and carried his bow as he
followed Moiraine and Lan inside, with Simion bowing and bobbing ahead of them. Loial had to duck
low under the lintel, and the ceiling inside only cleared his head by a foot. He kept rumbling to
himself about not understanding why so few humans remembered the Ogier. His voice was like
distant thunder. Even Perrin, right in front of him, could only understand half of his words.
The inn smelled of ale and wine, cheese and weariness, and the aroma of roasting mutton drifted
from somewhere in the back. The few men in the common room sagged over their mugs as if they
would really like to lie down on the benches and go to sleep. One plump serving woman was drawing
a mug of ale from one of the barrels at the end of the room. The innkeeper himself, in a long white
apron, sat on a tall stool in the corner, leaning against the wall. As the newcomers entered, he lifted
his head, bleary-eyed. His jaw dropped at the sight of Loial.
“Visitors, Master Harod,” Simion announced. “They want rooms. Master Harod? He’s an Ogier,
Master Harod.” The serving woman turned and saw Loial, and dropped the mug with a clatter. None
of the weary men at the tables even looked up. One had put his head down on the table and was
snoring.
Loial’s ears twitched violently.
Master Harod got to his feet slowly, eyes fastened on Loial, smoothing his apron all the while.
“At least he isn’t a Whitecloak,” he said at last, then gave a start as if surprised he had spoken aloud.
“That is to say, welcome, good mistress. Good masters. Forgive my lack of manners. I can only plead
tiredness, good mistress.” He darted another glance at Loial, and mouthed “Ogier?” with a look of
disbelief.
Loial opened his mouth, but Moiraine forestalled him. “As your man said, good innkeeper, I

wish rooms for my party for the night, and a meal.”
“Oh! Of course, good mistress. Of course. Simion, show these good people to my best rooms, so
they can put down their belongings. I’ll have a fine meal laid out for you when you return, good
mistress. A fine meal.”
“If it pleases you to follow me, good mistress,” Simion said. “Good masters.” He bowed the
way to stairs at one side of the common room.
Behind them, one of the men at the tables suddenly exclaimed, “What in the name of the Light is
that?” Master Harod began explaining about Ogier, making it sound as if he were quite familiar with
them. Most of what Perrin heard before they left the voices behind was wrong. Loial’s ears twitched
without stop.
On the second floor, the Ogier’s head came near to brushing along the ceiling. The narrow
corridor was growing dark, with only the sharp light of sunset through a window next to the door at
the far end.
“Candles in the rooms, good mistress,” Simion said. “I should have brought a lamp, but my head
is still spinning from all those weddings. I’ll send someone up to light the fire, if you wish. And
you’ll want wash water, of course.” He pushed open a door. “Our best room, good mistress. We
don’t have many—not many strangers, you see—but this is our best.”
“I’ll take the one next to it,” Lan said. He had Moiraine’s blanketroll and saddlebags on his
shoulder as well as his own, and the bundle containing the Dragon banner, too.
“Oh, good master, that’s not a very good room at all. Narrow bed. Cramped. Meant for a
servant, I suspect, as if we’d ever have anybody here who had a servant. Begging your pardon, good
mistress.”
“I will take it anyway,” Lan said firmly.
“Simion,” Moiraine said, “does Master Harod dislike the Children of the Light?”
“Well, he does, good mistress. He didn’t, but he does. It isn’t good policy, disliking the
Children, not so close to the border as we are. They come through Jarra all the time, like there wasn’t
any border at all. But there was trouble, yesterday. A fistful of trouble. And with the weddings going
on, and all.”
“What happened, Simion?”
The man looked at her sharply before answering. Perrin did not think anyone else saw how
sharply, in the dimness. “There was about twenty of them, come day before yesterday. No trouble
then. But yesterday. . . . Why, three of them up and announced they weren’t Children of the Light
anymore. They took off their cloaks and just rode away.”
Lan grunted. “Whitecloaks swear for life. What did their commander do?”
“Why, he would have done something, you can be sure, good master, but another of them
announced he was off to find the Horn of Valere. Anyway, still another said they should be hunting the
Dragon. That one said he was going to Almoth Plain when he left. Then some of them started saying
things to women in the streets, things they shouldn’t have, and grabbing at them. The women were
screaming, and Children yelling at the ones bothering the women. I never saw such commotion.”
“Didn’t any of you try to stop them?” Perrin said.
“Good master, you carry that axe like you know how to use it, but it isn’t so easy to face up to
men with swords and armor and all, when all you know how to use is a broom or a hoe. The rest of
the Whitecloaks, those as hadn’t gone off, put an end to it. Almost came to drawing swords. And that
wasn’t the worst. Two more just went mad—if the others weren’t. Those two started raving that Jarra
was full of Darkfriends. They tried to burn the village down—said they would!—beginning with the

Leap. You can see the burn marks out back, where they got it started. Fought the other Whitecloaks
when they tried to stop them. The Whitecloaks that were left, they helped us put it out, tied those two
up tight, and rode out of here, back toward Amadicia. Good riddance, I say, and if they never come
back, it’ll be too soon.”
“Rough behavior,” Lan said, “even for Whitecloaks.”
Simion bobbed his head in agreement. “As you say, good master. They never acted like that
before. Swagger around, yes. Look at you like you were dirt, and poke their noses in where they
hadn’t any business. But they never caused trouble before. Not like that, anyway.”
“They are gone now,” Moiraine said, “and troubles with them. I am sure we will pass a quiet
night.”
Perrin kept his mouth shut, but he was not quiet inside. All these weddings and Whitecloaks are
all very well, but I’d sooner know if Rand stopped here, and which way he went when he left. That
smell couldn’t have been him.
He let Simion guide him on down the hall to another room, with two beds and a washstand, a
pair of stools and not much else. Loial stooped to put his head through the doorway. Only a little light
came in by the narrow windows. The beds were big enough, with blankets and comforters folded at
the foot, but the mattresses looked lumpy. Simion fumbled on the mantel above the fireplace until he
found a candle, and a tinderbox to get it alight.
“I’ll see about getting some beds put together for you, good—uh—Ogier. Yes, just a moment,
now.” He showed no sign of hurry to be about it, though, fussing with the candlestick as if he had to
place it just right. Perrin thought he looked uneasy.
Well, I’d be more than uneasy if Whitecloaks had been acting like that in Emond’s Field.
“Simion, has another stranger passed through here in the last day or two? A young man, tall, with gray
eyes and reddish hair? He might have played the flute for a meal or a bed.”
“I remember him, good master,” Simion said, still shifting the candlestick. “Came yesterday
morning, early. Looked hungry, he did. He played the flute for all the weddings, yesterday. Goodlooking young fellow. Some of the women eyed him, at first, but. . . .” He paused, looking at Perrin
sideways. “Is he a friend of yours, good master?”
“I know him,” Perrin said. “Why?”
Simion hesitated. “No reason, good master. He was an odd fellow, that’s all. He talked to
himself, sometimes, and sometimes he laughed when nobody had said anything. Slept in this very
room, last night, or part of it. Woke us all in the middle of the night, yelling. It was just a nightmare,
but he wouldn’t stay any longer. Master Harod didn’t make much effort to talk him into it, after all that
noise.” Simion paused again. “He said something strange when he left.”
“What?” Perrin demanded.
“He said somebody was after him. He said. . . .” The chinless man swallowed and went on more
slowly. “Said they’d kill him if he didn’t go. ‘One of us has to die, and I mean it to be him.’ His very
words.”
“He did not mean us,” Loial rumbled. “We are his friends.”
“Of course, good—uh—good Ogier. Of course, he didn’t mean you. I—uh—I don’t mean to say
anything about a friend of yours, but I—uh—I think he’s sick. In the head, you know.”
“We will take care of him,” Perrin said. “That’s why we’re following him. Which way did he
go?”
“I knew it,” Simion said, bouncing on his toes. “I knew she could help as soon as I saw you.
Which way? East, good master. East, like the Dark One himself was on his heels. Do you think she’ll

help me? Help my brother, that is? Noam’s bad sick, and Mother Roon says she can’t do anything.”
Perrin kept his face expressionless, and bought a little time to think by propping his bow in the
corner and setting his blanketroll and saddlebags on one of the beds. The problem was that thinking
did not help much. He looked at Loial, but found no help there; consternation had the Ogier’s ears
drooping and his long eyebrows hanging down on his cheeks. “What makes you think she can help
your brother?” Stupid question! The right question is, what does he mean to do about it?
“Why, I traveled to Jehannah, once, good master, and I saw two . . . two women like her. I
couldn’t mistake her after that.” His voice dropped to a whisper. “It’s said they can raise the dead,
good master.”
“Who else knows this?” Perrin asked sharply, and at the same time Loial said, “If your brother is
dead, there is nothing anyone can do.”
The frog-faced man looked from one to the other of them anxiously, and his words came in a
babble. “No one knows but me, good master. Noam isn’t dead, good Ogier, only sick. I swear nobody
else could recognize her. Even Master Harod’s never been more than twenty miles from here in his
life. He’s so bad sick. I’d ask her myself, only my knees’d be shaking so hard she couldn’t hear me
talk. What if she took offense and called down lightning on me? And what if I’d been wrong? It isn’t
the kind of thing you accuse a woman of without. . . . I mean . . . uh. . . .” He raised his hands, half in
pleading, half as if to defend himself.
“I can make no promises,” Perrin said, “but I’ll speak to her. Loial, why don’t you keep Simion
company till I’ve spoken to Moiraine?”
“Of course,” the Ogier boomed. Simion gave a start when Loial’s hand swallowed his shoulder.
“He will show me my room, and we will talk. Tell me, Simion, what do you know of trees?”
“T-t-trees, g-good Ogier?”
Perrin did not wait any longer. He hurried back down the dark hall and knocked on Moiraine’s
door, barely waiting for her peremptory “Come!” before pushing in.
Half a dozen candles showed that the Leap’s best room was none too good, though the one bed
had four tall posts supporting a canopy, and the mattress looked less full of lumps than Perrin’s. There
was a scrap of carpet on the floor, and two cushioned chairs instead of stools. Other than that, it
looked no different from his room. Moiraine and Lan stood in front of the cold hearth as if they had
been discussing something, and the Aes Sedai did not look pleased at being interrupted. The
Warder’s face was as imperturbable as a carving.
“Rand’s been here, all right,” Perrin started off. “That fellow Simion remembers him.” Moiraine
hissed through her teeth.
“You were told to keep your mouth shut,” Lan growled.
Perrin squared his feet to face the Warder. That was easier than facing Moiraine’s glare. “How
could we find out whether he had been here without asking questions? Tell me that. He left last night,
if you are interested, heading east. And he was carrying on about somebody following him, trying to
kill him.”
“East.” Moiraine nodded. The utter calm of her voice was at odds with her disapproving eyes.
“That is good to know, though it had to be so if he is going to Tear. But I was fairly certain he had
been here even before I heard about the Whitecloaks, and they made it a certainty. Rand is almost
surely right about one thing, Perrin. I cannot believe we are the only ones trying to find him. And if
they find out about us, they may well try to stop us. We have enough to contend with trying to catch up
to Rand without that. You must learn to hold your tongue until I tell you to speak.”
“The Whitecloaks?” Perrin said incredulously. Hold my tongue? Burn me, if I will! “How could

they tell you—? Rand’s madness. It is catching?”
“Not his madness,” Moiraine said, “if he is far enough gone yet to be called mad. Perrin, he is
more strongly ta’veren than anyone since the Age of Legends. Yesterday, in this village, the Pattern
. . . moved, shaped itself around him like clay shaped on a mold. The weddings, the Whitecloaks,
these were enough to say Rand had been here, for anyone who knew to listen.”
Perrin drew a long breath. “And this is what we’ll find everywhere he’s been? Light, if there are
Shadowspawn after him, they can track him as easily as we can.”
“Perhaps,” Moiraine said. “Perhaps not. No one knows anything aboutta’veren as strong as
Rand.” For just a moment she sounded vexed at not knowing. “Artur Hawkwing was the most strongly
ta’veren of whom any writings remain. And Hawkwing was in no way as strong as Rand.”
“It is said,” Lan put in, “that there were times when people in the same room with Hawkwing
spoke truth when they meant to lie, made decisions they had not even known they were contemplating.
Times when every toss of the dice, every turn of the cards, went his way. But only times.”
“You mean you don’t know,” Perrin said. “He could leave a trail of weddings and Whitecloaks
gone mad all the way to Tear.”
“I mean I know as much as there is to know,” Moiraine said sharply. Her dark-eyed gaze
chastised Perrin like a whip. “The Pattern weaves finely around ta’veren, and others can follow the
shape of those threads if they know where to look. Be careful your tongue does not unravel more than
you can know.”
In spite of himself Perrin hunched his shoulders as if she were delivering real blows. “Well, you
had better be glad I opened my mouth this time. Simion knows you’re Aes Sedai. He wants you to
Heal his brother Noam of some sickness. If I hadn’t talked to him, he would never have worked up
nerve enough to ask, but he might have started talking among his friends.”
Lan caught Moiraine’s eye, and for a moment they stared at one another. The Warder had the air
about him of a wolf about to leap. Finally, Moiraine shook her head. “No,” she said.
“As you wish. It is your decision.” Lan sounded as if he thought she had made the wrong one, but
the tension left him.
Perrin stared at them. “You were thinking of. . . . Simion couldn’t tell anyone if he were dead,
could he?”
“He will not die by my actions,” Moiraine said. “But I cannot, and will not, promise that it will
always be so. We must find Rand, and I will not fail in that. Is that spoken plainly enough for you?”
Caught in her gaze, Perrin could make no answer. She nodded as if his silence were answer enough.
“Now take me to Simion.”
The door to Loial’s room stood open, spilling a pool of candlelight into the hall. The two beds
inside had been pushed together, and Loial and Simion were seated on the edge of one. The chinless
man was staring up at Loial with his mouth open and an expression of wonder on his face.
“Oh, yes, the stedding are wonderful,” Loial was saying. “There is such peace there, under the
Great Trees. You humans may have your wars and strife, but nothing ever troubles the stedding. We
tend the trees and live in harmony. . . .” He trailed off when he saw Moiraine, with Lan and Perrin
behind her.
Simion scrambled to his feet, bowing and backing away until he came up against the far wall.
“Uh . . . good mistress. . . . Uh . . . uh. . . .” Even then, he continued bobbing like a toy on a string.
“Show me to your brother,” Moiraine commanded, “and I will do what I can. Perrin, you will
come, too, since this good man spoke to you first.” Lan lifted an eyebrow, and she shook her head. “If
we all go, we might attract attention. Perrin can give me what protection I need.”

Lan nodded reluctantly, then gave Perrin a hard look. “See that you do, blacksmith. If any harm
befalls her. . . .” His cold blue eyes finished the promise.
Simion snatched one of the candles and scurried into the hallway, still bowing so the candlelight
made their shadows dance. “This way—uh—good mistress. This way.”
Beyond the door at the end of the hall, outside stairs led down to a cramped alleyway, between
inn and stable. Night shrank the candle to a flickering pinpoint. The half moon was up in a starflecked sky, giving more than enough light for Perrin’s eyes. He wondered when Moiraine would tell
Simion he did not have to keep bowing, but she never did. The Aes Sedai glided along, clutching her
skirts to keep them out of the mud, as though the dark passage were a palace hall and she a queen. The
air was already cooling; nights still carried echoes of winter.
“This way.” Simion led them back to a small shed behind the stable and hurriedly unbarred the
door. “This way.” Simion pointed. “There, good mistress. There. My brother. Noam.”
The far end of the shed had been barred off with slats of wood; hastily, by the rough look of it. A
stout iron lock in a hasp held shut a crude door of wooden slats. Behind those bars, a man lay
sprawled on his stomach on the straw-covered floor. He was barefoot, his shirt and breeches ripped
as if he had torn at them without knowing how to take them off. There was an odor of unwashed flesh
that Perrin thought even Simion and Moiraine must smell.
Noam lifted his head and stared at them silently, without expression. There was nothing at all
about him to suggest he was Simion’s brother—he had a chin, for one thing, and he was a big man,
with heavy shoulders—but that was not what staggered Perrin. Noam stared at them with burnished
golden eyes.
“He’d been talking crazy almost a year, good mistress, saying he could . . . could talk with
wolves. And his eyes. . . .” Simion darted a glance at Perrin. “Well, he’d talk about it when he’d
drunk too much. Everybody laughed at him. Then a month or so ago, he didn’t come to town. I went
out to see what was the matter, and I found him—like this.”
Cautiously, unwillingly, Perrin reached out toward Noam as he would have toward a wolf.
Running through the woods with the cold wind in his nose. Quick dash from cover, teeth snapping
at hamstrings. Taste of blood, rich on the tongue. Kill. Perrin jerked back as he would have from a
fire, sealed himself off. They were not thoughts at all, really, just a chaotic jumble of desires and
images, part memory, part yearning. But there was more wolf there than anything else. He put a hand
to the wall to steady himself; his knees felt weak. Light help me!
Moiraine put a hand on the lock.
“Master Harod has the key, good mistress. I don’t know if he’ll—”
She gave a tug, and the lock sprang open. Simion gaped at her. She lifted the lock free of the
hasp, and the chinless man turned to Perrin.
“Is that safe, good master? He’s my brother, but he bit Mother Roon when she tried to help, and
he . . . he killed a cow. With his teeth,” he finished faintly.
“Moiraine,” Perrin said, “the man is dangerous.”
“All men are dangerous,” she replied in a cool voice. “Now be quiet.” She opened the door and
went in. Perrin held his breath.
At her first step, Noam’s lips peeled back from his teeth, and he began to growl, a rumble that
deepened till his whole body quivered. Moiraine ignored it. Still growling, Noam wriggled
backwards in the straw as she came closer to him, until he had backed himself into a corner. Or she
had backed him.
Slowly, calmly, the Aes Sedai knelt and took his head between her hands. Noam’s growl

heightened to a snarl, then tailed off in a whimper before Perrin could move. For a long moment
Moiraine held Noam’s head, then just as calmly released it and rose. Perrin’s throat tightened as she
turned her back on Noam and walked out of the cage, but the man only stared after her. She pushed the
slatted door to, slipped the lock back through the hasp, not bothering to snap it shut—and Noam
hurled himself snarling against the wooden bars. He bit at them, and battered them with his shoulders,
tried to force his head between them, all the while snarling and snapping.
Moiraine brushed straw from her skirt with a steady hand and no expression.
“You do take chances,” Perrin breathed. She looked at him—a steady, knowing gaze—and he
dropped his eyes. His yellow eyes.
Simion was staring at his brother. “Can you help him, good mistress?” he asked hoarsely.
“I am sorry, Simion,” she said.
“Can’t you do anything, good mistress? Something? One of those”—his voice fell to a whisper
—“Aes Sedai things?”
“Healing is not a simple matter, Simion, and it comes from within as much as from the Healer.
There is nothing here that remembers being Noam, nothing that remembers being a man. There are no
maps remaining to show him the path back, and nothing left to take that path. Noam is gone, Simion.”
“He—he just used to talk funny, good mistress, when he’d had too much to drink. He just. . . .”
Simion scrubbed a hand across his eyes and blinked. “Thank you, good mistress. I know you’d have
done something if you could.” She put a hand on his shoulder, murmured comforting words, and then
she was gone from the shed.
Perrin knew he should follow her, but the man—what had once been a man—snapping at the
wooden bars, held him. He took a quick step and surprised himself by removing the dangling lock
from the hasp. The lock was a good one, the work of a master smith.
“Good master?”
Perrin stared at the lock in his hand, at the man behind in the cage. Noam had stopped biting at
the slats; he stared back at Perrin warily, panting. Some of his teeth had broken off jaggedly.
“You can leave him in here forever,” Perrin said, “but I—I don’t think he’ll ever get any better.”
“If he gets out, good master, he’ll die!”
“He will die in here or out there, Simion. Out there, at least he’ll be free, and as happy as he can
be. He is not your brother anymore, but you’re the one who has to decide. You can leave him in here
for people to stare at, leave him to stare at the bars of his cage until he pines away. You cannot cage a
wolf, Simion, not and expect it to be happy. Or live long.”
“Yes,” Simion said slowly. “Yes, I see.” He hesitated, then nodded, and jerked his head toward
the shed door.
That was all the answer Perrin needed. He swung back the slatted door and stood aside.
For a moment Noam stared at the opening. Abruptly he darted out of the cage, running on all
fours, but with surprising agility. Out of the cage, out of the shed, and into the night. The Light help us
both, Perrin thought.
“I suppose it’s better for him to be free.” Simion gave himself a shake. “But I don’t know what
Master Harod will say when he finds that door standing open and Noam gone.”
Perrin shut the cage door; the big lock made a sharp click as he refastened it. “Let him puzzle
that out.”
Simion barked a quick laugh, abruptly cut off. “He’ll make something out of it. They all will.
Some of them say Noam turned into a wolf—fur and all!—when he bit Mother Roon. It’s not true, but
they say it.”

Shivering, Perrin leaned his head against the cage door. He may not have fur, but he’s a wolf.
He’s wolf, not man. Light, help me.
“We didn’t keep him here always,” Simion said suddenly. “He was at Mother Roon’s house, but
she and I got Master Harod to move him here after the Whitecloaks came. They always have a list of
names, Darkfriends they’re looking for. It was Noam’s eyes, you see. One of the names the
Whitecloaks had was a fellow named Perrin Aybara, a blacksmith. They said he has yellow eyes, and
runs with wolves. You can see why I didn’t want them to know about Noam.”
Perrin turned his head enough to look at Simion over his shoulder. “Do you think this Perrin
Aybara is a Darkfriend?”
“A Darkfriend wouldn’t care if my brother died in a cage. I suppose she found you soon after it
happened. In time to help. I wish she’d come to Jarra a few months ago.”
Perrin was ashamed that he had ever compared the man to a frog. “And I wish she could have
done something for him.” Burn me, I wish she could. Suddenly it burst on him that the whole village
must know about Noam. About his eyes. “Simion, would you bring me something to eat in my room?”
Master Harod and the rest might have been too taken with staring at Loial to notice his eyes before,
but they surely would if he ate in the common room.
“Of course. And in the morning, too. You don’t have to come down until you are ready to get on
your horse.”
“You are a good man, Simion. A good man.” Simion looked so pleased that Perrin felt ashamed
all over again.

CHAPTER

Wolf Dreams

Perrin returned to his room by the back way, and after a time Simion came up with a covered
tray. The cloth did not hold in the smells of roasted mutton, sweetbeans, turnips, and freshly baked
bread, but Perrin lay on his bed, staring at the whitewashed ceiling, until the aromas grew cold.
Images of Noam ran through his head over and over again. Noam chewing at the wooden slats. Noam
running off into the darkness. He tried to think of lock-making, of the careful quenching and shaping of
the steel, but it did not work.
Ignoring the tray, he rose and made his way down the hall to Moiraine’s room. She answered his
rap on the door with, “Come in, Perrin.”
For an instant all the old stories about Aes Sedai stirred again, but he pushed them aside and
opened the door.
Moiraine was alone—for which he was grateful—sitting with an ink bottle balanced on her
knee, writing in a small, leather-bound book. She corked the bottle and wiped the steel nib of her pen
on a small scrap of parchment without looking at him. There was a fire in the fireplace.
“I have been expecting you for some time,” she said. “I have not spoken about this before
because it was obvious you did not want me to. After tonight, though. . . . What do you want to
know?”
“Is that what I can expect?” he asked. “To end like that?”
“Perhaps.”
He waited for more, but she only put pen and ink away in their small case of polished rosewood
and blew on her writing to dry it. “Is that all? Moiraine, don’t give me slippery Aes Sedai answers. If
you know something, tell me. Please.”
“I know very little, Perrin. While searching for other answers among the books and manuscripts
two friends keep for their researches, I found a copied fragment of a book from the Age of Legends. It
spoke of . . . situations like yours. That may be the only copy anywhere in the world, and it did not tell
me much.”
“What did it tell you? Anything at all is more than I know now. Burn me, I’ve been worrying
about Rand going mad, but I never thought I had to worry about myself!”
“Perrin, even in the Age of Legends, they knew little of this. Whoever wrote it seemed uncertain
whether it was truth or legend. And I only saw a fragment, remember. She said that some who talked
to wolves lost themselves, that what was human was swallowed up by wolf. Some. Whether she
meant one in ten, or five, or nine, I do not know.”
“I can shut them out. I don’t know how I do it, but I can refuse to listen to them. I can refuse to
hear them. Will that help?”
“It may.” She studied him, seeming to choose her words carefully. “Mostly, she wrote of

dreams. Dreams can be dangerous for you, Perrin.”
“You said that once before. What do you mean?”
“According to her, wolves live partly in this world, and partly in a world of dreams.”
“A world of dreams?” he said disbelievingly.
Moiraine gave him a sharp look. “That is what I said, and that is what she wrote. The way
wolves talk to one another, the way they talk to you, is in some way connected to this world of
dreams. I do not claim to understand how.” She paused, frowning slightly. “From what I have read of
Aes Sedai who had the Talent called Dreaming, Dreamers sometimes spoke of encountering wolves
in their dreams, even wolves that acted as guides. I fear you must learn to be as careful sleeping as
waking, if you intend to avoid wolves. If that is what you decide to do.”
“If that is what I decide? Moiraine, I will not end up like Noam. I won’t!”
She eyed him quizzically, shaking her head slowly. “You speak as if you can make all your own
choices, Perrin. You are ta’veren, remember.” He turned his back on her, staring at the night-dark
windows, but she continued: “Perhaps, knowing what Rand is, knowing how strongly ta’veren he is, I
have paid too little attention to the other two ta’veren I found with him. Three ta’veren in the same
village, all born within weeks of one another? That is unheard of. Perhaps you—and Mat—have
larger purposes in the Pattern than you, or I, thought.”
“I do not want any purpose in the Pattern,” Perrin muttered. “I surely can’t have one if I forget I
am a man. Will you help me, Moiraine?” It was hard to say that. What if it means her using the One
Power? Would I rather forget I’m a man? “Help me keep from—losing myself?”
“If I can keep you whole, I will. I promise you that, Perrin. But I will not endanger the struggle
against the Shadow. You must know that, too.”
When he turned to look at her, she was regarding him unblinkingly. And if your struggle means
putting me in my grave tomorrow, will you do that, too? He was icily sure that she would. “What
have you not told me?”
“Do not presume too far, Perrin,” she said coldly. “Do not press me further than I think proper.”
He hesitated before asking the next question. “Can you do for me what you did for Lan? Can you
shield my dreams?”
“I already have a Warder, Perrin.” Her lips quirked almost into a smile. “And one is all I will
have. I am of the Blue Ajah, not the Green.”
“You know what I mean. I don’t want to be a Warder.” Light, bound to an Aes Sedai the rest of
my life? That’s as bad as the wolves.
“It would not aid you, Perrin. The shielding is for dreams from the outside. The danger in your
dreams is within you.” She opened the small book again. “You should sleep,” she said in dismissal.
“Be wary of your dreams, but you must sleep sometime.” She turned a page, and he left.
Back in his own room, he eased the hold he kept on himself, eased it just a trifle, let his senses
spread. The wolves were out there still, beyond the edges of the village, ringing Jarra. Almost
immediately he snapped back to rigid self-control. “What I need is a city,” he muttered. That would
keep them at bay. After I find Rand. After I finish whatever has to be finished with him. He was not
sure how sorry he was that Moiraine could not shield him. The One Power or the wolves; that was a
choice no man should have to make.
He left the fire laid on the hearthstone unlit, and threw open both windows. Cold night air rushed
in. Tossing blankets and comforter on the floor, he lay down fully clothed on the lumpy bed, not
bothering to try to find a comfortable position. His last thought before sleep came was that if anything
would keep him from deep sleep and dangerous dreams, that mattress would.

He was in a long hallway, its high stone ceiling and walls glistening with damp and streaked by
odd shadows. They lay in contorted strips, stopping as abruptly as they began, too dark for the light
between them. He had no idea where the light came from.
“No,” he said, then louder, “No! This is a dream. I need to wake up. Wake up!”
The hallway did not change.
Danger. It was a wolf’s thought, faint and distant.
“I will wake up. I will!” He pounded a fist against the wall. It hurt, but he did not wake. He
thought one of the sinuous shadows shifted away from his blow.
Run, brother. Run.
“Hopper?” he said wonderingly. He was sure he knew the wolf whose thoughts he heard.
Hopper, who had envied the eagles. “Hopper is dead!”
Run!
Perrin lurched into a run, one hand holding his axe to keep the haft from banging against his leg.
He had no idea where he was running, or why, but the urgency of Hopper’s sending could not be
ignored. Hopper’s dead, he thought. He’s dead! But Perrin ran.
Other hallways crossed the one he ran along, at odd angles, sometimes descending, sometimes
climbing. None looked any different from the passage he was in, though. Damp stone walls unbroken
by doors, and strips of darkness.
As he came on one of those crossing halls, he skidded to a halt. A man stood there, blinking at
him uncertainly, in strangely cut coat and breeches, the coat flaring over his hips as the bottoms of the
breeches flared over his boots. Both were bright yellow, and his boots were only a little paler.
“This is more than I can stand,” the man said, to himself, not Perrin. He had an odd accent, quick
and sharp. “Not only do I dream of peasants, now, but foreign peasants, from those clothes. Begone
from my dreams, fellow!”
“Who are you?” Perrin asked. The man’s eyebrows rose as if he were offended.
The strips of shadow around them writhed. One detached from the ceiling at one end and drifted
down to touch the strange man’s head. It appeared to tangle in his hair. The man’s eyes widened, and
everything seemed to happen at once. The shadow jerked back to the ceiling, ten feet overhead,
trailing something pale. Wet drops splattered Perrin’s face. A bone-rattling shriek shattered the air.
Frozen, Perrin stared at the bloody shape wearing the man’s clothes, screaming and thrashing on
the floor. Unbidden, his eyes rose to the pale thing like an empty sack that dangled from the ceiling.
Part of it was already absorbed by the black strip, but he had no trouble recognizing a human skin,
apparently whole and unbroken.
The shadows around him danced in agitation, and Perrin ran, pursued by dying screams. Ripples
ran along the shadow strips, pacing him.
“Change, burn you!” he shouted. “I know it’s a dream! Light burn you, change!”
Colorful tapestries hung along the walls between tall golden stands holding dozens of candles
that illuminated white floor tiles and a ceiling painted with fluffy clouds and fanciful birds in flight.
Nothing moved but the flickering candle flames along the length of that hall, stretching as far as he
could see, or in the pointed arches of white stone that occasionally broke the walls.
Danger. The sending was even fainter than before. And more urgent, if that were possible.
Axe in hand, Perrin started warily down the hall, muttering to himself. “Wake up. Wake up,
Perrin. If you know it’s a dream, it changes or you wake up. Wake up, burn you!” The hallway stayed
as solid as any he had ever walked.

He came abreast of the first of the pointed white archways. It let into a huge room, apparently
windowless, but furnished as ornately as any palace, the furniture all carved and gilded and inlaid
with ivory. A woman stood in the middle of the room, frowning at a tattered manuscript lying open on
a table. A black-haired, black-eyed, beautiful woman clothed in white and silver.
Even as he recognized her, she lifted her head and looked straight at him. Her eyes widened, in
shock, in anger. “You! What are you doing here? How did you—? You’ll ruin things you could not
begin to imagine!”
Abruptly the space seemed to flatten, as if he were suddenly staring at a picture of a room. The
flat image appeared to turn sideways, become only a bright vertical line down the middle of
blackness. The line flashed white, and was gone, leaving only the dark, blacker than black.
Just in front of Perrin’s boots, the floor tiles came to an abrupt end. As he watched, the white
edges dissolved into the black like sand washed away by water. He stepped back hastily.
Run.
Perrin turned, and Hopper was there, a big gray wolf, grizzled and scarred. “You are dead. I
saw you die. I felt you die!” A sending flooded Perrin’s mind.
Run now! You must not be here now. Danger. Great danger. Worse than all the Neverborn.
You must go. Go now! Now!
“How?” Perrin shouted. “I want to go, but how?”
Go! Teeth bared, Hopper leaped for Perrin’s throat.
With a strangled cry, Perrin sat up on the bed, hands going to his throat to hold in lifeblood. They
met unbroken skin. He swallowed with relief, but the next moment his fingers touched a damp spot.
Almost falling in his haste, he scrambled off the bed, stumbled to the washstand and seized the
pitcher, splashed water everywhere as he filled the basin. The water turned pink as he washed his
face. Pink with the blood of that strangely dressed man.
More dark spots dotted his coat and breeches. He tore them off and tossed them into the furthest
corner. He meant to leave them there. Simion could burn them.
A gust of wind whipped in the open window. Shivering in shirt and smallclothes, he sat on the
floor and leaned back against the bed. This should be uncomfortable enough. Sourness tinged his
thoughts, and worry, and fear. And determination. I won’t give in to this. I won’t!
He was still shivering when sleep finally came, a shallow half sleep filled with vague
awareness of the room around him and thoughts of the cold. But the bad dreams that came were better
than some others.
Rand huddled under the trees in the night, watching the heavy-shouldered black dog come nearer
his hiding place. His side ached, the wound Moiraine could not quite Heal, but he ignored it. The
moon gave barely enough light for him to make out the dog, waist-high, with its thick neck and
massive head, and its teeth that seemed to shine like wet silver in the night. It sniffed the air and
trotted toward him.
Closer, he thought. Come closer. No warning for your master this time. Closer. That’s it. The
dog was only ten paces away, now, a deep growl rumbling in its chest as it suddenly bounded
forward. Straight at Rand.
The Power filled him. Something leaped from his outstretched hands; he was not sure what it
was. A bar of white light, solid as steel. Liquid fire. For an instant, in the middle of that something,
the dog seemed to become transparent, and then it was gone.

The white light faded except for the afterimage burned across Rand’s vision. He sagged against
the nearest tree trunk, the bark rough on his face. Relief and silent laughter shook him. It worked.
Light save me, it worked this time. It had not always. There had been other dogs this night.
The One Power pulsed in him, and his stomach twisted with the Dark One’s taint onsaidin,
wanted to empty itself. Sweat beaded on his face despite the cold night wind, and his mouth tasted
full of sickness. He wanted to lie down and die. He wanted Nynaeve to give him some of her
medicines, or Moiraine to Heal him, or. . . . Something, anything, to stop the sick feeling that was
suffocating him.
But saidin flooded him with life, too, life and energy and awareness larded through the illness.
Life without saidin was a pale copy. Anything else was a wan imitation.
But they can find me if I hold on. Track me, find me. I have to reach Tear. I’ll find out there.
If I am the Dragon, there’ll be an end to it. And if I am not. . . . If it’s all a lie, there will be an end
to that, too. An end.
Reluctantly, with infinite slowness, he severed contact with saidin, gave up its embrace as if
giving up life’s breath. The night seemed drab. The shadows lost their infinite sharp shadings and
washed together.
In the distance, to the west, a dog howled, a shivering cry in the silent night.
Rand’s head came up. He peered in that direction as though he could see the dog if he tried hard
enough.
A second dog answered the first, then another, and two more together, all spread out somewhere
west of him.
“Hunt me,” Rand snarled. “Hunt me if you will. I’m no easy meat. No more!”
Pushing himself away from the tree, he waded a shallow, icy stream, then settled into a steady
trot eastward. Cold water filled his boots, and his side hurt, but he ignored both. The night was quiet
again behind him, but he ignored that, too. Hunt me. I can hunt, too. I am no easy meat.

Secrets

Ignoring her companions for a moment, Egwene al’Vere stood in her stirrups hoping for a
glimpse of Tar Valon in the distance, but all she could see was something indistinct, gleaming white
in the morning sunlight. It had to be the city on the island, though. The lone, broken-topped mountain
called Dragonmount, rising out of the rolling plain, had first appeared on the horizon late the
afternoon before, and that lay just this side of the River Erinin from Tar Valon. It was a landmark, that
mountain—one jagged fang sticking up out of rolling flatlands—easily seen for many miles, easy to
avoid, as all did, even those who went to Tar Valon.
Dragonmount was where Lews Therin Kinslayer had died, so it was said; and other words had
been spoken of the mountain, prophecy and warning. Rich reasons to stay away from its black slopes.
She had reason not to stay away, and more than one. Only in Tar Valon could she find the
training she needed, the training she had to have. I will never be collared again! She pushed the
thought away, but it came back turned end about. I will never lose my freedom again! In Tar Valon,
Anaiya would resume testing her dreams; the Aes Sedai would have to, though she had found no real
evidence that Egwene was a Dreamer, as Anaiya suspected. Egwene’s dreams had been troubling
since leaving Almoth Plain. Aside from dreams of the Seanchan—and those still made her wake
sweating—she dreamed more and more of Rand. Rand running. Running toward something, but
running away from something, too.
She peered harder toward Tar Valon. Anaiya would be there. And Galad, too, perhaps. She
blushed in spite of herself, and banished him from her mind entirely. Think about the weather. Think
about anything else. Light, but it feels warm.
This early in the year, with winter only yesterday’s memory, white still capped Dragonmount,
but here below, the snows were melted. Early shoots poked through the matted brown of last year’s
grasses, and where trees topped a low hill here and there, the first red of new growth was showing.
After a winter spent traveling, sometimes trapped in village or camp for days by storms, sometimes
covering less ground between sunrise and sunset, with snowdrifts belly-deep on the horses, than she
could have walked by noon in better weather, it was good to see signs of spring.
Sweeping her thick wool cloak back out of her way, Egwene let herself drop down in the highcantled saddle, and smoothed her skirts in a gesture of impatience. Her dark eyes filled with distaste.
She had worn the dress, divided for riding by her own skill with a needle, for far too long, but the
only other she had was even more grubby. And the same color, the dark gray of the Leashed Ones.
The choice all those weeks ago, on beginning their ride to Tar Valon, had been dark gray or nothing.
“I swear I will never wear gray again, Bela,” she told her shaggy mount, patting the mare’s neck.
Not that I’ll have much choice once we’re back in the White Tower, she thought. In the Tower, all
novices wore white.

“Are you talking to yourself again?” Nynaeve asked, pulling her bay gelding closer. The two
women were of a height as well as dressed alike, but the difference in their horses put the former
Wisdom of Emond’s Field a head taller. Nynaeve frowned now, and tugged at the thick braid of dark
hair hanging over her shoulder, the way she did when worried or troubled, or sometimes when she
was preparing to be particularly stubborn even for her. A Great Serpent ring on her finger marked her
as one of the Accepted, not yet Aes Sedai, but a long step closer than Egwene. “Better you should be
keeping watch.”
Egwene held her tongue on the retort that she had been watching for Tar Valon. Did she think I
was standing in my stirrups because I do not like my saddle? Nynaeve seemed to forget too often
that she was not the Wisdom of Emond’s Field any longer, and Egwene was no longer a child. But
she wears the ring and I do not—yet!—and for her, that means nothing has changed!
“Do you wonder how Moiraine is treating Lan?” she asked sweetly, and had a moment of
pleasure at the sharp jerk Nynaeve gave her braid. The pleasure faded quickly, though. Wounding
remarks did not come naturally to her, and she knew Nynaeve’s emotions concerning the Warder
were like skeins of yarn after a kitten had gotten into the knitting basket. But Lan was no kitten, and
Nynaeve would have to do something about the man before his stubborn-stupid nobility made her mad
enough to kill him.
They were six altogether, all plainly dressed enough not to stand out in the villages and small
towns they had encountered, yet perhaps as odd a party as had crossed the Caralain Grass anytime
recently, four of them women, and one of the men in a litter slung between two horses. The litter
horses carried light packs, as well, with supplies for the long stretches between villages the way they
had come.
Six people, Egwene thought, and how many secrets? They all shared more than one, secrets that
would have to be kept, perhaps, even in the White Tower. Life was simpler back home.
“Nynaeve, do you think Rand is all right? And Perrin?” she added hastily. She could not afford
to pretend any longer that one day she would marry Rand; pretending would be all it was, now. She
did not like that—she was not entirely reconciled to it—but she knew it.
“Your dreams? Have they been troubling you again?” Nynaeve sounded concerned, but Egwene
was in no mood to accept sympathy.
She made her voice sound as everyday as she could manage. “From the rumors we heard, I can’t
tell what might be going on. They have everything I know about so twisted, so wrong.”
“Everything has been wrong since Moiraine came into our lives,” Nynaeve said brusquely.
“Perrin and Rand. . . .” She hesitated, grimacing. Egwene thought Nynaeve believed everything that
Rand had become was Moiraine’s doing. “They will have to take care of themselves for now. I’m
afraid we have something to worry about ourselves. Something is not right. I can . . . feel it.”
“Do you know what?” Egwene asked.
“It feels almost like a storm.” Nynaeve’s dark eyes studied the morning sky, clear and blue, with
only a few scattered white clouds, and she shook her head again. “Like a storm coming.” Nynaeve
had always been able to foretell the weather. Listening to the wind, it was called, and the Wisdom of
every village was expected to do it, though many really could not. Yet since leaving Emond’s Field,
Nynaeve’s ability had grown, or changed. The storms she felt sometimes had to do with men rather
than wind, now.
Egwene bit her underlip, thinking. They could not afford to be stopped or slowed, not after
coming so far, not so close to Tar Valon. For Mat’s sake, and for reasons that her mind might tell her
were more important than the life of one village youth, one childhood friend, but that her heart could

not rate so high. She looked at the others, wondering if any of them had noticed something.
Verin Sedai, short and plump and all in shades of brown, rode apparently lost in thought, the
hood of her cloak pulled forward till it all but hid her face, in the lead but letting her horse amble at
its own pace. She was of the Brown Ajah, and the Brown sisters usually cared more for seeking out
knowledge than for anything in the world around them. Egwene was not so sure of Verin’s
detachment, though. Verin had put herself hip-deep in the affairs of the world by being with them.
Elayne, of an age with Egwene and also a novice, but golden-haired and blue-eyed where
Egwene was dark, rode back beside the litter where Mat lay unconscious. In the same gray as Egwene
and Nynaeve, she was watching him with the worry they all felt. Mat had not roused in three days,
now. The lean, long-haired man riding on the other side of the litter seemed to be trying to look
everywhere without anyone noticing, and the lines of his face had deepened in concentration.
“Hurin,” Egwene said, and Nynaeve nodded. They slowed to let the litter catch up to them. Verin
ambled on ahead.
“Do you sense something, Hurin?” Nynaeve asked. Elayne lifted her eyes, suddenly intent, from
Mat’s litter.
With the three of them looking at him, the lean man shifted in his saddle and rubbed the side of
his long nose. “Trouble,” he said, curt and reluctant at the same time. “I think maybe . . . trouble.”
A thief-taker for the King of Shienar, he did not wear a Shienaran warrior’s topknot, yet the
short sword and notched sword-breaker at his belt were worn with use. Years of experience seemed
to have given him some talent at sniffing out wrongdoers, especially those who had done violence.
Twice on the journey he had advised them to leave a village after being there less than an hour.
The first time, they had all refused, saying they were too tired, but before the night was done the
innkeeper and two other men of the village had tried to murder them in their beds. They were only
simple thieves, not Darkfriends, just greedy for the horses and whatever they had in their saddlebags
and bundles. But the rest of the village knew of it, and apparently considered strangers fair gleanings.
They had been forced to flee a mob waving axe handles and pitchforks. The second time, Verin
ordered them to ride on as soon as Hurin spoke.
But the thief-taker was always wary when talking to any of his companions. Except Mat, back
when Mat could talk; the two of them had joked and played at dice, when the women were not too
close at hand. Egwene thought he might be uneasy at being alone, for all practical purposes, with an
Aes Sedai and three women in training for sisterhood. Some men found facing a fight easier than
facing Aes Sedai.
“What kind of trouble?” Elayne said.
She spoke easily, but with such a clear note of expecting to be answered, immediately and in
detail, that Hurin opened his mouth. “I smell—” He cut himself short and blinked as if surprised, eyes
darting from one woman to another. “Just a feeling,” he said finally. “A . . . a hunch. I’ve seen some
tracks, yesterday, and today. A lot of horses. Twenty or thirty going this way, twenty or thirty that. It
makes me wonder. That’s all. A feeling. But I say it’s trouble.”
Tracks? Egwene had not noticed them. Nynaeve said sharply, “I did not see anything worrisome
in them.” Nynaeve prided herself on being as good a tracker as any man. “They were days old. What
makes you think they are trouble?”
“I just think they are,” Hurin said slowly, as if he wanted to say more. He dropped his eyes,
rubbing at his nose and inhaling deeply. “It’s been a long time since we saw a village,” he muttered.
“Who knows what news from Falme has come before us? We might not find so good a welcome as
we expect. I’m thinking these men could be brigands, killers. We should be wary, I’m thinking. If Mat

was on his feet, I’d scout ahead, but maybe it’s best I don’t leave you alone.”
Nynaeve’s eyebrows lifted. “Do you believe we cannot look after ourselves?”
“The One Power won’t do you much good if somebody kills you before you can use it,” Hurin
said, addressing the tall pommel of his saddle. “Begging your pardon, but I think I. . . . I’ll just ride up
with Verin Sedai for a time.” He dug in his heels and galloped forward before any of them could
speak again.
“Now that is a surprise,” Elayne said as Hurin slowed a little distance from the Brown sister.
Verin did not seem to notice him any more than she noticed anything else, and he appeared content to
leave it so. “He has been staying as far from Verin as he could ever since we left Toman Head. He
always looks at her as if he’s afraid of what she might say.”
“Respecting Aes Sedai doesn’t mean he is not afraid of them,” Nynaeve said, then added,
reluctantly, “Of us.”
“If he thinks there might be trouble, we ought to send him out scouting.” Egwene took a deep
breath and gave the other two women as level a look as she could manage. “If there is trouble, we can
defend ourselves better than he could with a hundred soldiers to help him.”
“He doesn’t know that,” Nynaeve said flatly, “and I am not about to tell him. Or anyone else.”
“I can imagine what Verin would have to say about it.” Elayne sounded anxious. “I wish I had
some idea how much she does know. Egwene, I don’t know if my mother could help me if the
Amyrlin found out, much less help the pair of you. Or even whether she would try.” Elayne’s mother
was Queen of Andor. “She was only able to learn a little of the Power before she left the White
Tower, for all she has lived as if she had been raised to full sister.”
“We cannot hope to rely on Morgase,” Nynaeve said. “She is in Caemlyn, and we will be in Tar
Valon. No, we may be in enough trouble already for going off as we did, no matter what we’ve
brought back. It will be best if we stay low, behave humbly, and do nothing to attract more attention
than we already have.”
Another time, Egwene would have laughed at the idea of Nynaeve pretending to be humble. Even
Elayne managed a better job of it. But at present she did not feel like laughing. “And if Hurin is right?
If we are attacked? He cannot defend us against twenty or thirty men, and we might be dead if we
wait for Verin to do something. You said you sense a storm, Nynaeve.”
“You do?” Elayne said. Red-gold curls swung as she shook her head. “Verin will not like it if
we. . . .” She trailed off. “Whatever Verin likes or doesn’t like, we may have to.”
“I will do what must be done,” Nynaeve said sharply, “if there is anything to be done, and you
two will run, if need be. The White Tower may be all abuzz with your potential, but don’t think they
will not still you both if the Amyrlin Seat or the Hall of the Tower decides it is necessary.”
Elayne swallowed hard. “If they would still us for it,” she said in a faint voice, “they would still
you, too. We should all run together; or act together. Hurin has been right before. If we want to live to
be in trouble in the Tower, we may have to . . . to do what we must.”
Egwene shivered. Stilled. Cut off fromsaidar, the female half of the True Source. Few Aes
Sedai had ever incurred that penalty, yet there were deeds for which the Tower demanded stilling.
Novices were required to learn the names of every Aes Sedai who had ever been stilled, and their
crimes.
She could always feel the Source there, now, just out of sight, like the sun at noon over her
shoulder. If she often caught nothing when she tried to touch saidar, she still wanted to touch it. The
more she touched it, the more she wanted to, all the time, no matter what Sheriam Sedai, the Mistress
of Novices, said about the dangers of growing too fond of the feel of the One Power. To be cut off

from it; still able to sense saidar, but never to touch it again. . . .
Neither of the others seemed to want to talk, either.
To cover her shaking, she bent from her saddle to the gently swaying litter. Mat’s blankets had
become disarrayed, exposing a curved dagger in a golden sheath clutched in one hand, a ruby the size
of a pigeon’s egg capping the hilt. Careful not to touch the dagger, she eased the blankets back over
his hand. He was only a few years older than she, but gaunt cheeks and sallow skin had aged him. His
chest barely moved as he breathed hoarsely. A lumpy leather sack lay at his feet. She shifted the
blanket to cover that, too. We have to get Mat to the Tower, she thought. And the sack.
Nynaeve leaned down as well, and felt Mat’s forehead. “His fever is worse.” She sounded
worried. “If only I had some worrynot root or feverbane.”
“Perhaps if Verin tried Healing again,” Elayne said.
Nynaeve shook her head. She smoothed Mat’s hair back and sighed, then straightened before
speaking. “She says it is all she can do to keep him alive, now, and I believe her. I—I tried Healing
last night myself, but nothing happened.”
Elayne gasped. “Sheriam Sedai says we mustn’t try to Heal until we’ve been guided step by step
a hundred times.”
“You could have killed him,” Egwene said sharply.
Nynaeve sniffed loudly. “I was Healing before I ever thought of going to Tar Valon, even if I
didn’t know I was. But it seems I need my medicines to make it work for me. If I only had some
feverbane. I do not think he has much time left. Hours, maybe.”
Egwene thought she sounded almost as unhappy about knowing, about how she knew, as she did
about Mat. She wondered again why Nynaeve had chosen to go to Tar Valon for training at all. She
had learned to channel unknowingly, even if she could not always control the act, and had passed the
crisis that killed three out of four women who learned without Aes Sedai guidance. Nynaeve said she
wanted to learn more, but often she was as reluctant about it as a child being dosed with sheepstongue
root.
“We will have him in the White Tower soon,” Egwene said. “They can Heal him there. The
Amyrlin will take care of him. She will take care of everything.” She did not look at where Mat’s
blanket covered the sack at his feet. The other two women were studiously not looking at it, either.
There were some secrets they would all be relieved to shed.
“Riders,” Nynaeve said suddenly, but Egwene had already seen them. Two dozen men appearing
over a low rise ahead, white cloaks flapping as they galloped, angling toward them.
“Children of the Light,” Elayne said, like a curse. “I think we have found your storm, and
Hurin’s trouble.”
Verin had pulled up, a hand on Hurin’s arm to stop him drawing his sword. Egwene touched the
lead litter horse to stop it just behind the plump Aes Sedai.
“Let me do all the talking, children,” the Aes Sedai said placidly, pushing her cowl back to
reveal gray in her hair. Egwene was not sure how old Verin was; she thought old enough to be a
grandmother, but the gray streaks were the Aes Sedai’s only signs of age. “And whatever you do, do
not allow them to make you angry.”
Verin’s face was as calm as her voice, but Egwene thought she saw the Aes Sedai measuring the
distance to Tar Valon. The tops of the towers were visible now, and a high bridge arching over the
river to the island, tall enough for the trading ships that plied the river to sail beneath.
Close enough to see, Egwene thought, but too far to do any good.
For a moment she was sure the oncoming Whitecloaks meant to charge them, but their leader

raised a hand and they abruptly drew rein a scant forty paces off, scattering dust and dirt ahead of
them.
Nynaeve muttered angrily under her breath, and Elayne sat straight and full of pride, appearing
likely to berate the Whitecloaks for ill manners. Hurin still had a grip on his sword hilt; he looked
ready to put himself between the women and the Whitecloaks no matter what Verin said. Verin mildly
waved a hand in front of her face to dispel the dust. The white-cloaked riders spread out in an arc,
blocking the way firmly.
Their breastplates and conical helmets shone from polishing, and even the mail on their arms
gleamed brightly. Each man had the flaring, golden sun on his breast. Some fitted arrows to bows,
which they did not raise, but held ready. Their leader was a young man, yet he wore two golden knots
of rank beneath the sunburst on his cloak.
“Two Tar Valon witches, unless I miss my guess, yes?” he said with a tight smile that pinched
his narrow face. Arrogance brightened his eyes, as if he knew some truth others were too stupid to
see. “And two nits, and a pair of lapdogs, one sick and one old.” Hurin bristled, but Verin’s hand
restrained him. “Where do you come from?” the Whitecloak demanded.
“We come from the west,” Verin said placidly. “Move out of our way, and let us continue. The
Children of the Light have no authority here.”
“The Children have authority wherever the Light is, witch, and where the Light is not, we bring
it. Answer my questions! Or must I take you to our camp and let the Questioners ask?”
Mat could not afford any more delay in reaching help in the White Tower. And more importantly
—Egwene winced to think of it that way—more importantly, they could not let the contents of that
sack fall into Whitecloak hands.
“I have answered you,” Verin said, still calm, “and more politely than you deserve. Do you
really believe you can stop us?” Some of the White-cloaks raised their bows as if she had uttered a
threat, but she went on, her voice never rising. “In some lands you may hold sway by your threats, but
not here, in sight of Tar Valon. Can you truly believe that in this place, you will be allowed to carry
off Aes Sedai?”
The officer shifted uneasily in his saddle, as though suddenly doubting whether he could back up
his words. Then he glanced back at his men—either to remind himself of their support or because he
had remembered they were watching—and with that he took himself in hand. “I have no fear of your
Darkfriend ways, witch. Answer me, or answer the Questioners.” He did not sound as forceful as he
had.
Verin opened her mouth as if for idle conversation, but before she could speak, Elayne jumped
in, voice ringing with command. “I am Elayne, Daughter-Heir of Andor. If you do not move aside at
once, you will have Queen Morgase to answer to, Whitecloak!” Verin hissed with vexation.
The Whitecloak looked taken aback for an instant, but then he laughed. “You think it so, yes?
Perhaps you will discover Morgase no longer has so much love for witches, girl. If I take you from
them and return you to her side, she will thank me for it. Lord Captain Eamon Valda would like very
much to speak to you, Daughter-Heir of Andor.” He raised a hand, whether to gesture or signal his
men, Egwene could not say. Some of the White-cloaks gathered their reins.
There’s no more time to wait , Egwene thought. I will not be chained again! She opened herself
to the One Power. It was a simple exercise, and after long practice, it went much more swiftly than
the first time she had tried. In a heartbeat her mind emptied of everything, everything but a single
rosebud, floating in emptiness. She was the rosebud, opening to the light, opening to saidar, the
female half of the True Source. The Power flooded her, threatening to sweep her away. It was like

being filled with light, with the Light, like being one with the Light, a glorious ecstasy. She fought to
keep from being overwhelmed, and focused on the ground in front of the Whitecloak officer’s horse.
A small patch of ground; she did not want to kill anyone. You will not take me!
The man’s hand was still going up. With a roar the ground in front of him erupted in a narrow
fountain of dirt and rocks higher than his head. Screaming, his horse reared, and he rolled out of his
saddle like a sack.
Before he hit the ground, Egwene shifted her focus closer to the other Whitecloaks, and the
ground threw up another small explosion. Bela danced sideways, but she controlled the mare with
reins and knees without even thinking of it. Wrapped inside emptiness, she was still surprised at a
third eruption, not of her making, and a fourth. Distantly, she was aware of Nynaeve and Elayne, both
enveloped in the glow that said they, too, had embraced saidar, had been embraced by it. That aura
would not be visible to any but another woman who could channel, but the results were visible to all.
Explosions harried the Whitecloaks on every side, showering them with dirt, shaking them with noise,
sending their horses plunging wildly.
Hurin stared around him, mouth open and obviously as frightened as the Whitecloaks, as he tried
to keep the litter horses and his own mount from bolting. Verin was wide-eyed with astonishment and
anger. Her mouth worked furiously, but whatever she might be saying was lost in the thunder.
And then the Whitecloaks were running away, some dropping their bows in panic, galloping as if
the Dark One himself were at their backs. All but the young officer, who was picking himself up off
the ground. Shoulders hunched, he stared at Verin, the whites of his eyes showing all the way ’round.
Dust stained his fine white cloak, and his face, but he did not seem to notice. “Kill me, then, witch,”
he said shakily. “Go ahead. Kill me, as you killed my father!”
The Aes Sedai ignored him. Her attention was all on her companions. As if they, too, had
forgotten their officer, the fleeing Whitecloaks vanished over the same rise where they had first
appeared, all in a body and none looking back. The officer’s horse ran with them.
Under Verin’s furious gaze, Egwene let go of saidar, slowly, unwillingly. It was always hard,
letting go. Even more slowly, the glow around Nynaeve vanished. Nynaeve was frowning hard at the
pinch-faced Whitecloak before them, as if he might still be capable of some sort of trickery. Elayne
looked shocked by what she had done.
“What you have done,” Verin began, then stopped to take a deep breath. Her stare took in all
three of the younger women. “What you have done is an abomination. An abomination! An Aes Sedai
does not use the Power as a weapon except against Shadowspawn, or in the last extreme to defend
her life. The Three Oaths—”
“They were ready to kill us,” Nynaeve broke in heatedly. “Kill us, or carry us off to be tortured.
He was giving the order.”
“It . . . it was not really using the Power as a weapon, Verin Sedai.” Elayne held her chin high,
but her voice shook. “We did not hurt anyone, or even try to hurt anyone. Surely—”
“Do not split hairs with me!” Verin snapped. “When you become full Aes Sedai—if you ever
become full Aes Sedai!—you will be bound to obey the Three Oaths, but even novices are expected
to do their best to live as if already bound.”
“What about him?” Nynaeve gestured to the Whitecloak officer, still standing there and looking
stunned. Her face was as tight as a drum; she seemed almost as angry as the Aes Sedai. “He was
about to take us prisoner. Mat will die if he doesn’t reach the Tower soon, and . . . and. . . .”
Egwene knew what Nynaeve was struggling not to say aloud. And we can’t let that sack fall
into any hands but the Amyrlin’s.

Verin regarded the Whitecloak wearily. “He was only trying to bully us, child. He knew very
well he could not make us go where we did not want, not without more trouble than he was willing to
accept. Not here, not in sight of Tar Valon. I could have talked us past him, with a little time and a
little patience. Oh, he might well have tried to kill us if he could have done it from hiding, but no
Whitecloak with the brains of a goat will try harming an Aes Sedai who knows he is there. See what
you have done! What stories will those men tell, and what harm will it do?”
The officer’s face had reddened when she mentioned hiding. “It is no cowardice not to charge
the powers that Broke the World,” he burst out. “You witches want to Break the World again, in the
service of the Dark One!” Verin shook her head in tired disbelief.
Egwene wished she could mend some of the damage she had done. “I am very sorry for what I
did,” she told the officer. She was glad she was not bound to speak no word that was not true, as full
Aes Sedai were, because what she had said was only half true at best. “I should not have, and I
apologize. I am sure Verin Sedai will Heal your bruises.” He stepped back as if she had offered to
have him skinned alive, and Verin sniffed loudly. “We have come a long way,” Egwene went on, “all
the way from Toman Head, and if I weren’t so tired, I would never have—”
“Be quiet, girl!” Verin shouted at the same time the Whitecloak snarled, “Toman Head? Falme!
You were at Falme!” He stumbled back another step and half drew his sword. From the look on his
face, Egwene did not know whether he meant to attack, or to defend himself. Hurin moved his horse
closer to the Whitecloak, a hand on his sword-breaker, but the narrow-faced man went on in a rant,
spittle flying with his fury. “My father died at Falme! Byar told me! You witches killed him for your
false Dragon! I’ll see you dead for it! I will see you burn!”
“Impetuous children,” Verin sighed. “Almost as bad as boys for letting your mouths run away
with you. Go with the Light, my son,” she told the Whitecloak.
Without another word, she guided them around the man, but his shouts followed after. “My name
is Dain Bornhald! Remember it, Darkfriends! I will make you fear my name! Remember my name!”
As Bornhald’s shouts faded behind them, they rode in silence for a time. Finally, Egwene said to
no one in particular, “I was only trying to make things better.”
“Better!” Verin muttered. “You must learn there is a time to speak all of the truth, and a time to
govern your tongue. The least of the lessons you must learn, but important, if you mean to live long
enough to wear the shawl of a full sister. Did it never occur to you that word of Falme might have
come ahead of us?”
“Why should it have occurred to her?” Nynaeve asked. “No one we’ve met before this had heard
more than rumors, if that, and we have outrun even rumor in the last month.”
“And all word has to come along the same roads we used?” Verin replied. “We have moved
slowly. Rumor takes wing along a hundred paths. Always plan for the worst, child; that way, all your
surprises will be pleasant ones.”
“What did he mean about my mother?” Elayne said suddenly. “He must have been lying. She
would never turn against Tar Valon.”
“The Queens of Andor have always been friends to Tar Valon, but all things change.” Verin’s
face was calm again, yet there was a tightness in her voice. She turned in her saddle to look over
them, the three young women, Hurin, Mat in the litter. “The world is strange, and all things change.”
They capped the ridge; a village was in sight ahead of them now, yellow tile roofs clustered around
the great bridge that led to Tar Valon. “Now you must truly be on your guard,” Verin told them. “Now
the real danger begins.”

CHAPTER
11

Tar Valon

The small village of Darein had lain beside the River Erinin almost as long as Tar Valon had
occupied its island. Darein’s small, red and brown brick houses and shops, its stone-paved streets,
gave a feel of permanence, but the village had been burned in the Trolloc Wars, sacked when Artur
Hawkwing’s armies besieged Tar Valon, looted more than once during the War of the Hundred
Years, and put to the torch again in the Aiel War, not quite twenty years before. An unquiet history for
a little village, but Darein’s place, at the foot of one of the bridges leading out to Tar Valon, ensured
it would always be rebuilt, however many times it was destroyed. So long as Tar Valon stood, at
least.
At first it seemed to Egwene that Darein was expecting war again. A square of pikemen marched
along the streets, ranks and files bristling like a carding comb, followed by bowmen in flat, rimmed
helmets, with filled quivers riding at their hips and bows slanted across their chests. A squadron of
armored horsemen, faces hidden behind the steel bars of their helmets, gave way to Verin and her
party at a wave of their officer’s gauntleted hand. All wore the White Flame of Tar Valon, like a
snowy teardrop, on their breasts.
Yet townspeople went about their business with apparent unconcern, the market throng dividing
around the soldiers as if marching men were obstructions they were long used to. A few men and
women carrying trays of fruit kept pace with the soldiers, trying to interest them in wrinkled apples
and pears pulled from winter cellars, but aside from those few, shopkeepers and hawkers alike paid
the soldiers no mind. Verin seemingly ignored them, too, as she led Egwene and the others through the
village to the great bridge, arching over half a mile or more of water like lace woven from stone.

At the foot of the bridge more soldiers stood guard, a dozen pikemen and half that many archers,
checking everyone who wanted to cross. Their officer, a balding man with his helmet hanging on his
sword hilt, looked harassed by the waiting line of people afoot and on horseback, people with carts
drawn by oxen or horses or the owner. The line was only a hundred paces long, but every time one
was let onto the bridge, another joined the far end. Just the same, the balding man seemed to be taking
his time about making sure each one had a right to enter Tar Valon before he let them go.
He opened his mouth angrily when Verin led her party to the head of the line, then caught a good
look at her face and hurriedly stuffed his helmet onto his head. No one who really knew them needed
a Great Serpent ring to identify Aes Sedai. “Good morrow to you, Aes Sedai,” he said, bowing with a
hand to his heart. “Good morrow. Go right across, if it please you.”
Verin reined in beside him. A murmur rose from the waiting line, but no one voiced a complaint
aloud. “Trouble from the Whitecloaks, guardsman?”
Why are we stopping? Egwene wondered urgently. “Has she forgotten about Mat?”
“Not really, Aes Sedai,” the officer said. “No fighting. They tried to move into Eldone Market,
the other side of the river, but we showed them better. The Amyrlin means to make sure they don’t try
again.”
“Verin Sedai,” Egwene began carefully, “Mat—”
“In a moment, child,” the Aes Sedai said, sounding only halfway absentminded. “I have not
forgotten him.” Her attention went right back to the officer. “And the outlying villages?”
The man shrugged uncomfortably. “We can’t keep the Whitecloaks out, Aes Sedai, but they move
off when our patrols ride in. They seem to be trying to goad us.” Verin nodded, and would have
ridden on, but the officer spoke again. “Pardon, Aes Sedai, but you’ve obviously come from a
distance. Have you any news? Fresh rumors come upriver with every trading vessel. They say there’s
a new false Dragon out west somewhere. Why, they even say he has Artur Hawkwing’s armies, back
from the dead, following him, and that he killed a lot of Whitecloaks and destroyed a city—Falme,
they call it—in Tarabon, some say.”
“They say Aes Sedai helped him!” a man’s voice shouted from the waiting line. Hurin breathed
deeply, and shifted himself as if he expected violence.
Egwene looked ’round, but there was no sign of whoever had shouted. Everyone appeared to be
concerned only with waiting, patiently or impatiently, for his turn to cross. Things had changed, and
not for the better. When she had left Tar Valon, any man who spoke against Aes Sedai would have
been lucky to escape with a punch in the nose from whoever overheard. Red in the face, the officer
was glaring down the line.
“Rumors are seldom true,” Verin told him. “I can tell you that Falme still stands. It isn’t even in
Tarabon, guardsman. Listen less to rumor, and more to the Amyrlin Seat. The Light shine on you.” She
lifted her reins, and he bowed as she led the others past him.
The bridge struck Egwene with wonder, as the bridges of Tar Valon always did. The openwork
walls looked intricate enough to tax the best craftswoman at her lace-frame. It hardly seemed that
such could have been done with stone, or that it could stand even its own weight. The river rolled,
strong and steady, fifty paces or more below, and for all that half mile the bridge flowed unsupported
from riverbank to island.
Even more wondrous, in its own way, was the feeling that the bridge was taking her home. More
wondrous, and shocking. Emond’s Field is my home. But it was in Tar Valon that she would learn
what she must to keep her alive, to keep her free. It was in Tar Valon that she would learn—must
learn—why her dreams disturbed her so, and why they sometimes seemed to have meanings she could

not puzzle out. Tar Valon was where her life was tied, now. If she ever returned to Emond’s Field—
the “if” hurt, but she had to be honest—if she returned, it would be to visit, to see her parents. She had
already gone beyond being an innkeeper’s daughter. Those bonds would not hold her again, either, not
because she hated them, but because she had outgrown them.
The bridge was only the beginning. It arched straight to the walls that surrounded the island, high
walls of gleaming white, silver-streaked stone, whose tops looked down on the bridge’s height. At
intervals, guard towers interrupted the walls, of the same white stone, their massive footings washed
by the river. But above the walls and beyond rose the true towers of Tar Valon, the towers of story,
pointed spires and flutes and spirals, some connected by airy bridges a good hundred paces or more
above the ground. And still only the beginning.
There were no guards on the bronze-clad gates, and they stood wide enough for twenty abreast to
ride through, opening onto one of the broad avenues that crisscrossed the island. Spring might barely
have come, but the air already smelled of flowers and perfumes and spices.
The city took Egwene’s breath as if she had never seen it before. Every square and street
crossing had its fountain, or its monument or statue, some atop great columns as high as towers, but it
was the city itself that dazzled the eye. What was plain in form might have so many ornaments and
carvings that it seemed an ornament itself, or, lacking decoration, used its form alone for grandeur.
Great buildings and small, in stone of every color, looking like shells, or waves, or wind-sculpted
cliffs, flowing and fanciful, captured from nature or the flights of men’s minds. The dwellings, the
inns, the very stables—even the most insignificant buildings in Tar Valon had been made for beauty.
Ogier stonemasons had built most of the city in the long years after the Breaking of the World, and
they maintained it had been their finest work.
Men and women of every nation thronged the streets. They were dark of skin, and pale, and
everything in between, their garments in bright colors and patterns, or drab, but decked with fringes
and braids and shining buttons, or stark and severe; showing more skin than Egwene thought proper,
or revealing nothing but eyes and fingertips. Sedan chairs and litters wove through the crowds, the
trotting bearers crying “Give way!” Closed carriages inched along, liveried coachmen shouting
“Hiya!” and “Ho!” as if they believed they might achieve more than a walk. Street musicians played
flute or harp or pipes, sometimes accompanying a juggler or an acrobat, always with a cap set out for
coins. Wandering hawkers cried their wares, and shopkeepers standing in front of their shops shouted
the excellence of their goods. A hum filled the city like the song of a thing alive.
Verin had pulled her cowl back up, hiding her face. No one seemed to be paying them any mind
in these crowds, Egwene thought. Not even Mat in his horse litter drew a second glance, though some
folk did edge away from it as they hurried past. People sometimes brought their sick to the White
Tower for Healing, and whatever he had might be catching.
Egwene rode up beside Verin and leaned close. “Do you really expect trouble now? We are in
the city. We are almost there.” The White Tower stood in plain sight now, the great building gleaming
broad and tall above the rooftops.
“I always expect trouble,” Verin replied placidly, “and so should you. In the Tower most of all.
You must all of you be more careful than ever, now. Your . . . tricks”—her mouth tightened for an
instant before serenity returned—“frightened away the Whitecloaks, but inside the Tower they may
well bring you death or stilling.”
“I would not do that in the Tower,” Egwene protested. “None of us would.” Nynaeve and Elayne
had joined them, leaving Hurin to mind the litter horses. They nodded, Elayne fervently, and Nynaeve,
it seemed to Egwene, as if she had reservations.

“You should not do it ever again, child. You must not! Ever!” Verin eyed them sideways ’round
the edge of her cowl, and shook her head. “And I truly hope you have learned the folly of speaking
when you should be silent.” Elayne’s face went crimson, and Egwene’s cheeks grew hot. “Once we
enter the Tower grounds, hold your tongues and accept whatever happens. Whatever happens! You
know nothing of what awaits us in the Tower, and if you did, you would not know how to handle it.
So be silent.”
“I will do as you say, Verin Sedai,” Egwene said, and Elayne echoed her. Nynaeve sniffed. The
Aes Sedai stared at her, and she nodded reluctantly.
The street opened into a vast square, centered in the city, and in the middle of the square stood
the White Tower, shining in the sun, rising until it seemed to touch the sky from a palace of domes and
delicate spires and other shapes surrounded by the Tower grounds. There were surprisingly few
people in the square. No one intruded on the Tower unless he had business there, Egwene reminded
herself uneasily.
Hurin led the horse litter forward as they entered the square. “Verin Sedai, I must leave you
now.” He eyed the Tower once, then managed not to look at it again, though it was hard to look at
anything else. Hurin came from a land where Aes Sedai were respected, but it was one thing to
respect them and quite another to be surrounded by them.
“You have been a great help on our journey, Hurin,” Verin told him, “and a long journey it has
been. There will be a place in the Tower for you to rest before you travel on.”
Hurin shook his head emphatically. “I cannot waste a day, Verin Sedai. Not another hour. I must
return to Shienar, to tell King Easar, and Lord Agelmar, the truth of what happened at Falme. I must
tell them about—” He cut off abruptly and looked around. There was no one close enough to
overhear, but he still lowered his voice and said only, “About Rand. That the Dragon is Reborn.
There must be trading ships heading upriver, and I mean to be on the next to sail.”
“Go in the Light, then, Hurin of Shienar,” Verin said.
“The Light illumine all of you,” he replied, gathering his reins. Yet he hesitated a moment, then
added, “If you need me—ever—send word to Fal Dara, and I’ll find a way to come.” Clearing his
throat as if embarrassed, he turned his horse and trotted away, heading beyond the Tower. All too
soon he was lost to sight.
Nynaeve gave an exasperated shake of her head. “Men! They always say to send for them if you
need them, but when you do need one, you need him right then.”
“No man can help where we are going now,” Verin said dryly. “Remember. Be silent.”
Egwene felt a sense of loss with Hurin’s going. He would barely talk to any of them, except Mat,
and Verin was right. He was only a man, and helpless as a babe when it came to facing whatever
might await them in the Tower. Yet his leaving made their number one less, and she could never help
thinking that a man with a sword was useful to have around. And he had been a link to Rand, and
Perrin. I have my own troubles to worry about. Rand and Perrin would have to make do with
Moiraine to look after them. And Min will certainly look after Rand, she thought with a flash of
jealousy that she tried to suppress. She almost succeeded.
With a sigh, she took up the lead of the horse litter. Mat lay bundled to his chin; his breathing
was a dry rasp. Soon, she thought. You’ll be Healed soon, now. And we’ll find out what’s waiting
for us. She wished Verin would stop trying to frighten them. She wished she did not think Verin had
reason to frighten them.
Verin took them around the Tower grounds to a small side gate that stood open, with two guards.
Pausing, the Aes Sedai pushed back her cowl and leaned from her saddle to speak softly to one of the

men. He gave a start, and a surprised look at Egwene and the others. With a quick, “As you command,
Aes Sedai,” he took off into the grounds at a run. Verin was already riding through the gates as he
spoke. She rode as if there were no hurry.
Egwene followed with the litter, exchanging glances with Nynaeve and Elayne, wondering what
Verin had told the man.
A gray stone guardhouse stood just inside the gate, shaped like a six-pointed star lying on its
side. A small knot of guards lounged in the doorway; they left off talking and bowed as Verin rode
past.
This part of the Tower grounds could have been some lord’s park, with trees and pruned shrubs
and wide graveled paths. Other buildings were visible through the trees, and the Tower itself loomed
over everything.
The path led them to a stableyard among the trees, where grooms in leather vests came running to
take their horses. At the Aes Sedai’s direction, some of the grooms unfastened the litter and set it
gently off to one side. As the horses were led away into the stable, Verin took the leather sack from
Mat’s feet and tucked it carelessly under one arm.
Nynaeve paused in knuckling her back and frowned at the Aes Sedai. “You said he has hours,
perhaps. Are you just going to—”
Verin held up a hand, but whether it was the gesture that stopped Nynaeve or the crunch of feet
approaching on gravel, Egwene could not say.
In a moment Sheriam Sedai appeared, followed by three of the Accepted, their white dresses
ringed at the hem with the colors of all seven Ajahs from Blue to Red, and two husky men in rough,
laborer’s coats. The Mistress of Novices was a slightly plump woman, with the high cheekbones that
were common in Saldaea. Flame-red hair and clear, tilted green eyes made her smooth Aes Sedai
features striking. She eyed Egwene and the others calmly, but her mouth was tight.
“So you have brought back our three runaways, Verin. With everything that happened, I could
almost wish you had not.”
“We did not—” Egwene began, but Verin cut her off with a sharp, “BE SILENT !” Verin stared at her
—at each of the three of them—as if the intensity of her look could hold their mouths shut.
Egwene was sure that, for her part, it could. She had never seen Verin angry before. Nynaeve
crossed her arms beneath her breasts and muttered under her breath, but she said nothing. The three
Accepted behind Sheriam kept their silence, of course, but Egwene thought she could see their ears
grow from listening.
When she was certain Egwene and the others would remain still, Verin turned back to Sheriam.
“The boy must be taken somewhere away from everyone. He is ill, dangerously so. Dangerous to
others as well as to himself.”
“I was told you had a litter to be carried.” Sheriam motioned the two men to the litter, spoke a
quiet word to one, and as quickly as that Mat was whisked away.
Egwene opened her mouth to say he needed help now, but at Verin’s stare, quick and furious, she
closed it again. Nynaeve was tugging her braid nearly hard enough to pull it out of her head.
“I suppose,” Verin said, “that the whole Tower knows we have returned by now?”
“Those who do not know,” Sheriam told her, “will know before much longer. Comings and
goings have become the first topic of conversation and gossip. Even before Falme, and far ahead of
the war in Cairhien. Did you think to keep it secret?”
Verin gathered the leather sack in both arms. “I must see the Amyrlin. Immediately.”
“And what of these three?”

Verin considered Egwene and her friends, frowning. “They must be closely held until the
Amyrlin wishes to see them. If she does wish to. Closely held, mind. Their own rooms will do, I
think. No need for cells. Not a word to anyone.”
Verin was still speaking to Sheriam, but Egwene knew the last had been meant as a reminder to
her and the others. Nynaeve’s brows were drawn down, and she jerked at her braid as if she wanted
to hit something. Elayne’s blue eyes were open wide, and her face was even paler than usual. Egwene
was not sure which feelings she shared, anger or fear or worry. Some of all three, she thought.
With a last, searching glance at her three traveling companions, Verin hurried off, clutching the
sack to her chest, cloak flapping behind her. Sheriam put her fists on her hips and studied Egwene and
the other two. For a moment Egwene felt a lessening of tension. The Mistress of Novices always kept
a steady temper and a sympathetic sense of humor even when she was giving you extra chores for
breaking the rules.
But Sheriam’s voice was grim when she spoke. “Not a word, Verin Sedai said, and not a word
shall it be. If one of you speaks—except to answer an Aes Sedai, of course—I’ll make you wish you
had nothing but a switching and a few hours scrubbing floors to worry about. Do you understand me?”
“Yes, Aes Sedai,” Egwene said, and heard the other two say the same, although Nynaeve
pronounced the words like a challenge.
Sheriam made a disgusted sound in her throat, almost a growl. “Fewer girls now come to the
Tower to be trained than once did, but they still come. Most leave never having learned to sense the
True Source, much less touch it. A few learn enough not to harm themselves before they go. A bare
handful can aspire to be raised to the Accepted, and fewer still to wear the shawl. It is a hard life, a
hard discipline, yet every novice fights to hold on, to attain the ring and the shawl. Even when they
are so afraid they cry themselves to sleep every night, they struggle to hold on. And you three, who
have more ability born in you than I ever hoped to see in my lifetime, left the Tower without
permission, ran away not even half-trained, like irresponsible children, stayed away for months. And
now you ride back in as if nothing has happened, as if you can take up your training again on the
morrow.” She let out a long breath as if she might explode otherwise. “Faolain!”
The three Accepted jumped as if they had been caught eavesdropping, and one, a dark, curlyhaired woman, stepped forward. They were all young women, but still older than Nynaeve.
Nynaeve’s rapid Acceptance had been extraordinary. In the normal course of things, it took years as a
novice to earn the Great Serpent rings they wore, and would take years more before they could hope
to be raised to full Aes Sedai.
“Take them to their rooms,” Sheriam commanded, “and keep them there. They may have bread,
cold broth, and water until the Amyrlin Seat says otherwise. And if one of them speaks even a word,
you may take her to the kitchens and set her to scrubbing pots.” She whirled and stalked away, even
her back expressing anger.
Faolain eyed Egwene and the others with almost a hopeful air, especially Nynaeve, who wore a
glower like a mask. Faolain’s round face held no love for those who broke the rules so extravagantly,
and less for one like Nynaeve, a wilder who had earned her ring without ever being a novice, who
had channeled power before she ever entered Tar Valon. When it became obvious that Nynaeve
meant to keep her anger to herself, Faolain shrugged. “When the Amyrlin sends for you, you’ll
probably be stilled.”
“Give over, Faolain,” another of the Accepted said. The oldest of the three, she had a willowy
neck and coppery skin, and a graceful way of moving. “I will take you,” she told Nynaeve. “I am
called Theodrin, and I, too, am a wilder. I will hold you to Sheriam Sedai’s order, but I will not bait

you. Come.”
Nynaeve gave Egwene and Elayne a worried look, then sighed and let Theodrin lead her away.
“Wilders,” Faolain muttered. On her tongue, it sounded like a curse. She turned her stare to
Egwene.
The third Accepted, a pretty, apple-cheeked young woman, stationed herself beside Elayne. Her
mouth was turned up at the corners as if she liked to smile, but the stern look she gave Elayne said she
would brook no nonsense now.
Egwene returned Faolain’s stare with as much calm as she could manage, and, she hoped, a
measure of the haughty, silent contempt that Elayne had adopted. Red Ajah, she thought. This one will
definitely choose the Reds. But it was hard not to think of her own troubles. Light, what are they
going to do to us? She meant the Aes Sedai, the Tower, not these women.
“Well, come along,” Faolain snapped. “It’s bad enough I have to stand guard on your door
without standing here all day. Come along.”
Taking a deep breath, Egwene gripped Elayne’s hand and followed. Light, let them be Healing
Mat.

The Amyrlin Seat

Siuan Sanche paced the length of her study, pausing now and again to glance, with a blue-eyed
gaze that had made rulers stammer, at a carved nightwood box on a long table centered in the room.
She hoped she would not have to use any of the carefully drawn documents within it. They had been
prepared and sealed in secret, by her own hand, to cover a dozen possible eventualities. She had laid
a warding on the box so that if any hand but hers opened it, the contents would flash to ash in an
instant; very likely the box itself would burst into flame.
“And burn the thieving fisher-bird, whoever she might be, so she never forgets it, I hope,” she
muttered. For the hundredth time since being told that Verin had returned, she readjusted her stole on
her shoulders without realizing what she was doing. It hung below her waist, broad and striped with
the colors of the seven Ajahs. The Amyrlin Seat was of all Ajahs and of none, no matter from which
she had been raised.
The room was ornate, for it had belonged to generations of women who had worn the stole. The
tall fireplace and broad, cold hearth were all carved golden marble from Kandor, and the diamondshaped floor tiles, polished redstone from the Mountains of Mist. The walls were panels of some pale
striped wood, hard as iron and carved in fantastic beasts and birds of unbelievable plumage, panels
brought from the lands beyond the Aiel Waste by the Sea Folk before Artur Hawkwing was born.
Tall, arched windows, open now to let in the new, green smells, let onto a balcony overlooking her
small private garden, where she seldom had time to walk.
All that grandeur was in stark contrast to the furnishings Siuan Sanche had brought to the room.
The one table and the stout chair behind it were plain, if well polished with age and beeswax, as was
the only other chair in the room. That stood off to one side, close enough to be drawn up if she wished
a visitor to sit. A small Tairen rug lay in front of the table, woven in simple patterns of blue and
brown and gold. A single drawing, tiny fishing boats among reeds, hung above the fireplace. Half a
dozen stands held open books about the floor. That was all. Even the lamps would not have been out
of place in a farmer’s house.
Siuan Sanche had been born poor in Tear, and had worked on her father’s fishing boat, one just
like the boats in the drawing, in the delta called the Fingers of the Dragon, before ever she dreamed
of coming to Tar Valon. Even the nearly ten years since she had been raised to the Seat had not made
her comfortable with too much luxury. Her bedchamber was more simple still.
Ten years with the stole, she thought. Nearly twenty since I decided to sail these dangerous
waters. And if I slip now, I’ll wish I were back hauling nets.
She spun at a sound. Another Aes Sedai had slipped into the room, a copper-skinned woman
with dark hair cut short. She caught herself in time to keep her voice steady and say only what was
expected. “Yes, Leane?”

The Keeper of the Chronicles bowed, just as deeply as she would had others been present. The
tall Aes Sedai, as tall as most men, was second only to the Amyrlin in the White Tower, and though
Siuan had known her since they were novices together, sometimes Leane’s insistence on upholding
the dignity of the Amyrlin Seat was enough to make Siuan want to scream.
“Verin is here, Mother, asking leave to speak with you. I have told her you are busy, but she asks
—”
“Not too busy to speak to her,” Siuan said. Too quickly, she knew, but she did not care. “Send
her in. There’s no need for you to remain, Leane. I will speak to her alone.”
A twitch of her eyebrows was the Keeper’s only sign of surprise. The Amyrlin seldom saw
anyone, even a queen, without the Keeper present. But the Amyrlin was the Amyrlin. Leane bowed
her way out, and in moments Verin took her place, kneeling to kiss the Great Serpent ring on Siuan’s
finger. The Brown sister had a good-sized leather sack under her arm.
“Thank you for seeing me, Mother,” Verin said as she straightened. “I have urgent news from
Falme. And more. I scarcely know where to begin.”
“Begin where you will,” Siuan said. “These rooms are warded, in case anyone thinks to use
childhood tricks of eavesdropping.” Verin’s eyebrows lifted in surprise, and the Amyrlin added,
“Much has changed since you left. Speak.”
“Most importantly, then, Rand al’Thor has proclaimed himself the Dragon Reborn.”
Siuan felt a tightness loosen in her chest. “I hoped it was he,” she said softly. “I have had reports
from women who could only tell what they had heard, and rumors by the score come with every
trader’s boat and merchant’s wagon, but I could not be sure.” She took a deep breath. “Yet I think I
can name the day it happened. Did you know the two false Dragons no longer trouble the world?”
“I had not heard, Mother. That is good news.”
“Yes. Mazrim Taim is in the hands of our sisters in Saldaea, and the poor fellow in Haddon
Mirk, the Light have pity on his soul, was taken by the Tairens and executed on the spot. No one even
seems to know what his name was. Both were taken on the same day and, according to rumor, under
the same circumstances. They were in battle, and winning, when suddenly a great light flashed in the
sky, and a vision appeared, just for an instant. There are a dozen different versions of what it was, but
in both cases the result was exactly the same. The false Dragon’s horse reared up and threw him. He
was knocked unconscious, and his followers cried out that he was dead, and fled the field, and he
was taken. Some of my reports speak of visions in the sky at Falme. I’ll wager a gold mark to a weekold delta perch that was the instant Rand al’Thor proclaimed himself.”
“The true Dragon has been Reborn,” Verin said almost to herself, “and so the Pattern has no
room for false Dragons anymore. We have loosed the Dragon Reborn on the world. The Light have
mercy on us.”
The Amyrlin shook her head irritably. “We have done what must be done.” And if even the
newest novice learns of it, I will be stilled before the next sunrise, if I’m not torn to pieces first.
Me, and Moiraine, and Verin, and likely anyone thought to be a friend of ours, as well. It was not
easy to carry on so great a conspiracy when only three women knew of it, when even a close friend
would betray them and consider it a duty well done. Light, but I wish I could be sure they would not
be right to do it. “At least he is safely in Moiraine’s hands. She will guide him, and do what must be
done. What else have you to tell me, Daughter?”
For answer, Verin placed the leather sack on the table and took out a curled, gold horn, with
silver script inlaid around its flaring bell mouth. She laid the horn on the table, then looked to the
Amyrlin with quiet expectation.

Siuan did not have to be close enough to read the script to know what it said. Tia mi aven
Moridin isainde vadin. “The grave is no bar to my call.” “The Horn of Valere?” she gasped. “You
brought that all the way here, across hundreds of leagues, with the Hunters looking everywhere for it?
Light, woman, it was to be left with Rand al’Thor.”
“I know, Mother,” Verin said calmly, “but the Hunters all expect to find the Horn in some great
adventure, not in a sack with four women escorting a sick youth. And it would do Rand no good.”
“What do you mean? He is to fight Tarmon Gai’don. The Horn is to summon dead heroes from
the grave to fight in the Last Battle. Has Moiraine once again made some new plan without consulting
me?”
“This is none of Moiraine’s doing, Mother. We plan, but the Wheel weaves the Pattern as it
wills. Rand was not first to sound the Horn. Matrim Cauthon did that. And Mat now lies below, dying
of his ties to the Shadar Logoth dagger. Unless he can be Healed here.”
Siuan shivered. Shadar Logoth, that dead city so tainted that even Trollocs feared to enter, and
with reason. By chance, a dagger from that place had come into young Mat’s hands, twisting and
tainting him with the evil that had killed the city long ago. Killing him. By chance? Or by the
Pattern? He is ta’veren, too, after all. But . . . Mat sounded the Horn. Then—
“So long as Mat lives,” Verin went on, “the Horn of Valere is no more than a horn to anyone
else. If he dies, of course, another can sound it and forge a new link between man and Horn.” Her
gaze was steady and untroubled by what she seemed to be suggesting.
“Many will die before we are done, Daughter.” And who else could I use to sound it again? I’ll
not take the risk of trying to return it to Moiraine, now. One of the Gaidin, perhaps. Perhaps. “The
Pattern has yet to make his fate clear.”
“Yes, Mother. And the Horn?”
“For the moment,” the Amyrlin said finally, “we will find some place to hide this where no one
but we two know. I will consider what to do after that.”
Verin nodded. “As you say, Mother. Of course, a few hours will make one decision for you.”
“Is that all you have for me?” Siuan snapped. “If it is, I have those three runaways to deal with.”
“There is the matter of the Seanchan, Mother.”
“What of them? All my reports say they have fled back across the ocean, or to wherever they
came from.”
“It seems so, Mother. But I fear we may have to deal with them again.” Verin pulled a small
leather notebook from behind her belt and began leafing through it. “They spoke of themselves as the
Forerunners, or Those Who Come Before, and talked of the Return, and of reclaiming this land as
theirs. I’ve taken notes on everything I heard of them. Only from those who actually saw them, of
course, or had dealings with them.”
“Verin, you are worrying about a lionfish out in the Sea of Storms, while here and now the
silverpike are chewing our nets to shreds.”
The Brown sister continued turning pages. “An apt metaphor, Mother, the lionfish. Once I saw a
large shark that a lionfish had chased into the shallows, where it died.” She tapped one page with a
finger. “Yes. This is the worst. Mother, the Seanchan use the One Power in battle. They use it as a
weapon.”
Siuan clasped her hands tightly at her waist. The reports the pigeons had brought spoke of that,
too. Most had only secondhand knowledge, but a few women wrote of seeing for themselves. The
Power used as a weapon. Even dry ink on paper carried an edge of hysteria when they wrote of that.
“That is already causing us trouble, Verin, and will cause more as the stories spread, and grow with

the spreading. But I can do nothing about that. I am told these people are gone, Daughter. Do you have
any evidence otherwise?”
“Well, no, Mother, but—”
“Until you do, let us deal with getting the silverpike out of our nets before they start chewing
holes in the boat, too.”
With reluctance, Verin closed the notebook and tucked it back behind her belt. “As you say,
Mother. If I might ask, what do you intend to do to Nynaeve and the other two girls?”
The Amyrlin hesitated, considering. “Before I am done with them, they will wish they could go
down to the river and sell themselves for fishbait.” It was the simple truth, but it could be taken in
more than one way. “Now. Seat yourself, and tell me everything those three have said and done in the
time they were with you. Everything.”

Punishments

Lying on her narrow bed, Egwene frowned up at the flickering shadows cast on the ceiling by
her single lamp. She wished she could form some plan of action, or reason out what to expect next.
Nothing came. The shadows had more pattern than her thoughts. She could hardly even make herself
worry about Mat, yet the shame she felt at that was small, crushed by the walls around her.
It was a stark, windowless room, like all those in the novices’ quarters, small and square and
painted white, with pegs on one wall for hanging her belongings, the bed built against a second, and a
tiny shelf on a third, where in other days she had kept a few books borrowed from the Tower library.
A washstand and a three-legged stool completed the furnishings. The floorboards were almost white
from scrubbing. She had done that task, on hands and knees, every day she had lived there, in addition
to her other chores and lessons. Novices lived simply, whether they were innkeepers’ daughters or
the Daughter-Heir of Andor.
She wore the plain white dress of a novice again—even her belt and pouch were white—but she
felt no joy at having rid herself of the hated gray. Her room had become too much of a prison cell.
What if they mean to keep me here. In this room. Like a cell. Like a collar and. . . .
She glanced at the door—the dark Accepted would still be standing guard on the other side, she
knew—and rolled close to the white plastered wall. Just above the mattress was a small hole, almost
invisible unless you knew where to look, drilled through into the next room by novices long ago.
Egwene kept her voice to a whisper.
“Elayne?” There was no answer. “Elayne? Are you asleep?”
“How could I sleep?” came Elayne’s reply, a reedy whisper through the hole. “I thought we
might be in some trouble, but I did not expect this. Egwene, what are they going to do to us?”
Egwene had no answer, and her guesses were not of the sort she wanted to voice aloud. She did
not even want to think of them. “I actually thought we might be heroes, Elayne. We brought back the
Horn of Valere safely. We discovered Liandrin is Black Ajah.” Her voice skipped on that. Aes Sedai
had always denied the existence of a Black Ajah, an Ajah that served the Dark One, and were known
to become angry with anyone who even suggested it was real. But we know it’s real. “We should be
heroes, Elayne.”
“ ‘Should and would build no bridges,’ ” Elayne said. “Light, I used to hate it when Mother said
that to me, but it’s true. Verin said we mustn’t speak of the Horn, or Liandrin, to anyone but her or the
Amyrlin Seat. I do not think any of this will work out the way we thought. It is not fair. We’ve been
through so much; you’ve been through so much. It just is not fair.”
“Verin says. Moiraine says. I know why people think Aes Sedai are puppetmasters. I can almost
feel the strings on my arms and legs. Whatever they do, it will be what they decide is good for the
White Tower, not what is good or fair for us.”

“But you still want to be Aes Sedai. Don’t you?”
Egwene hesitated, but there was never any real question as to her answer. “Yes,” she said. “I
still do. It is the only way we will ever be safe. But I will tell you this. I’ll not let myself be stilled.”
That was a new thought, voiced as soon as it came to her, but she realized she did not want to take it
back. Give up touching the True Source? She could sense it there, even now, the glow just over her
shoulder, the shining just out of sight. She resisted the desire to reach out to it. Give up being filled
with the One Power, feeling more alive than I ever have before? I won’t! “Not without a fight.”
There was a long silence from the other side of the wall. “How could you stop it? You may be
as strong as any of them, now, but neither one of us knows enough yet to stop even one Aes Sedai
from shielding us from the Source, and there are dozens of them here.”
Egwene considered. Finally she said, “I could run away. Really run away, this time.”
“They would come after us, Egwene. I’m sure they would. Once you show any ability at all, they
don’t let you go until you’ve learned enough not to kill yourself. Or just die from it.”
“I am not a simple village girl anymore. I have seen something of the world. I can keep out of
Aes Sedai hands if I want to.” She was trying to convince herself as much as Elayne.And what if I
don’t know enough, yet? Enough about the world, enough about the Power? What if just
channeling can still kill me? She refused to think of that. So much I have to learn yet. I won’t let
them stop me.
“My mother might protect us,” Elayne said, “if what that Whitecloak said is true. I never thought
I would hope something like that was the truth. But if it isn’t, Mother is just as likely to send us both
back in chains. Will you teach me how to live in a village?”
Egwene blinked at the wall. “You will come with me? If it comes to that, I mean?”
There was another long silence, then a faint whisper. “I do not want to be stilled, Egwene. I will
not be. I will not be!”
The door swung open, crashing against the wall, and Egwene sat up with a start. She heard the
bang of a door from the other side of the wall. Faolain stepped into Egwene’s room, smiling as her
eyes went to the tiny hole. Similar holes joined most of the novice rooms; any woman who had been a
novice knew of them.
“Whispering with your friend, eh?” the curly-haired Accepted said with surprising warmth.
“Well, it grows lonely, waiting by yourself. Did you have a nice chat?”
Egwene opened her mouth, then closed it again hastily. She could answer Aes Sedai, Sheriam
had said. No one else. She regarded the Accepted with a level expression and waited.
The false sympathy slid off Faolain’s face like water running off a roof. “On your feet. The
Amyrlin’s not to be kept waiting by the likes of you. You are lucky I did not come in in time to hear
you. Move!”
Novices were supposed to obey the Accepted almost as quickly as they obeyed Aes Sedai, but
Egwene got to her feet slowly, and took as much time as she dared in smoothing her dress. She gave
Faolain a small curtsy and a tiny smile. The scowl that rolled across the Accepted’s face made
Egwene’s smile grow before she remembered to rein it in; there was no point in pushing Faolain too
far. Holding herself straight, pretending her knees were not shaking, she preceded the Accepted out of
the room.
Elayne was already waiting outside with the apple-cheeked Accepted, looking fiercely
determined to be brave. Somehow, she managed to give the impression that the Accepted was a
handmaid carrying her gloves. Egwene hoped that she herself was doing half so well.
The railed galleries of the novices’ quarters rose tier on tier above, in a hollow column, and fell

as many below, to the Novices’ Court. There were no other women in sight. Even if every novice in
the Tower had been there, though, less than a quarter of the rooms would have been filled. The four of
them walked ’round the empty galleries and down the spiraling ramps in silence; none could bear to
have the sounds of voices emphasize the emptiness.
Egwene had never before been into the part of the Tower where the Amyrlin had her rooms. The
corridors there were wide enough for a wagon to pass down easily, and taller than they were wide.
Colorful tapestries hung on the walls, tapestries in a dozen styles, of floral designs and forest scenes,
of heroic deeds and intricate patterns, some so old they looked as if they might break if handled. Their
shoes made loud clicks on diamond-shaped floor tiles that repeated the colors of the seven Ajahs.
There were few other women in evidence—an Aes Sedai now and then, sweeping majestically
along with no time to notice Accepted or novices; five or six Accepted hurrying self-importantly
about their tasks or studies; a sprinkling of serving women with trays, or mops, or armfuls of sheets or
towels; a few novices moving on errands even more quickly than the servants.
Nynaeve and her slim-necked escort, Theodrin, joined them. Neither spoke. Nynaeve wore an
Accepted’s dress, now, white with the seven colored bands at the hem, but her belt and pouch were
her own. She gave Egwene and Elayne each a reassuring smile and a hug—Egwene was so relieved
to see another friendly face that she returned the hug with barely a thought that Nynaeve was behaving
as if she were comforting children—but as they walked on, Nynaeve gave her thick braid a sharp tug
from time to time, too.
Very few men came into that part of the Tower, and Egwene saw only two: Warders walking
side by side in conversation, one with his sword on his hip, the other with his on his back. One was
short and slender, even slight, the other almost as wide as he was tall, yet both moved with a
dangerous grace. The color-shifting Warder cloaks made them queasy-making to watch for long, parts
of them sometimes seeming to fade into the walls beyond. She saw Nynaeve looking at them, and
shook her head. She has to do something about Lan. If any of us can do anything about anyone
after today.
The antechamber of the Amyrlin Seat’s study was grand enough for any palace, though the chairs
scattered about for those who might wait were plain, but Egwene had eyes only for Leane Sedai. The
Keeper wore her narrow stole of office, blue to show she had been raised from the Blue Ajah, and
her face could have been carved from smooth, brownish stone. There was no one else there.
“Did they give any trouble?” The Keeper’s clipped way of talking gave no hint now of either
anger or sympathy.
“No, Aes Sedai,” Theodrin and the apple-cheeked Accepted said together.
“This one had to be pulled by the scruff of her neck, Aes Sedai,” Faolain said, indicating
Egwene. The Accepted sounded indignant. “She balks as if she has forgotten what the discipline of
the White Tower is.”
“To lead,” Leane said, “is neither to push nor to pull. Go to Marris Sedai, Faolain, and ask her
to allow you to contemplate on this while raking the paths in the Spring Garden.” She dismissed
Faolain and the other two Accepted, and they dropped deep curtsies. From the depth of hers, Faolain
shot a furious look at Egwene.
The Keeper paid no attention to the Accepted’s leaving. Instead, she studied the remaining
women, tapping a forefinger against her lips, till Egwene had the feeling they had all been measured
to the inch and weighed to the ounce. Nynaeve’s eyes took on a dangerous sparkle, and she had a tight
grip on her braid.
Finally Leane raised a hand toward the doors to the Amyrlin’s study. The Great Serpent bit its

own tail, a pace across, on the dark wood of each. “Enter,” she said.
Nynaeve stepped forward promptly and opened one of the doors. That was enough to get
Egwene moving. Elayne held her hand tightly, and she gripped Elayne’s just as hard. Leane followed
them in and took a place to one side, halfway between the three of them and the table in the center of
the room.
The Amyrlin Seat sat behind the table, examining papers. She did not look up. Once Nynaeve
opened her mouth, but closed it again, at a sharp look from the Keeper. The three of them stood in a
line in front of the Amyrlin’s table and waited. Egwene tried not to fidget. Long minutes went by—it
seemed like hours—before the Amyrlin raised her head, but when those blue eyes fixed them each in
turn, Egwene decided she could have waited longer. The Amyrlin’s gaze was like two icicles boring
into her heart. The room was cool, but a trickle of sweat began to run down her back.
“So!” the Amyrlin said finally. “Our runaways return.”
“We did not run away, Mother.” Nynaeve was obviously straining for calm, but her voice shook
with emotion. Anger, Egwene knew. That strong will was all too often accompanied by anger.
“Liandrin told us we were to go with her, and—” The loud crack of the Amyrlin’s hand slapping the
table cut her off.
“Do not invoke Liandrin’s name here, child!” the Amyrlin snapped. Leane watched them with a
stern serenity.
“Mother, Liandrin is Black Ajah,” Elayne burst out.
“That is known, child. Suspected, at least, and as good as known. Liandrin left the Tower some
months ago, and twelve other—women—went with her. None has been seen since. Before they left,
they tried to break into the storeroom where the angreal and sa’angreal are kept, and did manage to
enter that where the smaller ter’angreal are stored. They stole a number of those, including several
we do not know the use of.”
Nynaeve stared at the Amyrlin in horror, and Elayne suddenly rubbed her arms as if she were
cold. Egwene knew she was shivering, too. Many times she had imagined returning to confront
Liandrin and accuse her, to see her condemned to some punishment—except that she had never
managed to imagine any punishment strong enough to suit that doll-faced Aes Sedai’s crimes. She had
even pictured returning to find Liandrin already fled—in terror of her return, it was usually. But she
had never imagined anything like this. If Liandrin and the others—she had not really wanted to
believe there were others—had stolen those remnants of the Age of Legends, there was no telling
what they could do with them. Thank the Light they did not get any sa’angreal, she thought. The
other was bad enough.
Sa’angreal were like angreal, allowing an Aes Sedai to channel more of the Power than she
safely could unaided, but far more powerful than angreal, and rare. Ter’angreal were something
different. Existing in greater numbers than either angreal or sa’angreal, though still not common, they
used the One Power rather than helping to channel it, and no one truly understood them. Many would
work only for someone who could channel, needing the actual channeling of the Power, while others
did what they did for anyone. Where all the angreal and sa’angreal Egwene had ever heard of were
small, ter’angreal could seemingly be any size. Each had apparently been made for a specific
purpose by those Aes Sedai of three thousand years ago, to do a certain thing, and Aes Sedai since
had died trying to learn what; died, or had the ability to channel burned out of them. There were
sisters of the Brown Ajah who had made ter’angreal their life’s study.
Some were in use, if likely not for the purposes they had been made. The stout white rod that the
Accepted held while taking the Three Oaths on being raised to Aes Sedai was a ter’angreal, binding

them to the oaths as surely as if they had been bred in the bone. Another ter’angreal was the site of
the final test before a novice was raised to the Accepted. There were others, including many no one
could make work at all, and many others that seemed to have no practical use.
Why did they take things no one knows how to use? Egwene wondered. Or maybe the Black
Ajah does know. That possibility made her stomach churn. That might be as bad as sa’angreal in
Darkfriend hands.
“Theft,” the Amyrlin went on in tones as cold as her eyes, “was the least of what they did. Three
sisters died that night, as well as two Warders, seven guards, and nine of the servants. Murder, done
to hide their thieving and their flight. It may not be proof that they were—Black Ajah”—the words
grated from her mouth—“but I cannot believe otherwise. When there are fish heads and blood in the
water, you don’t need to see the silverpike to know they are there.”
“Then why are we being treated as criminals?” Nynaeve demanded. “We were tricked by a
woman of the—of the Black Ajah. That should be enough to clear us of any wrongdoing.”
The Amyrlin barked a mirthless laugh. “You think so, do you, child? It may be your salvation
that no one in the Tower but Verin, Leane, and I even suspects you had anything to do with Liandrin. If
that were known, much less the little demonstration you put on for the Whitecloaks—no need to look
so surprised; Verin told me everything—if it were known you had gone off with Liandrin, the Hall
might very well vote for stilling the three of you before you could take a breath.”
“That is not fair!” Nynaeve said. Leane stirred, but Nynaeve went on. “It is not right! It—!”
The Amyrlin stood up. That was all, but it cut Nynaeve short.
Egwene thought she was wise to keep quiet. She had always believed Nynaeve was as strong, as
strong-willed, as anyone could be. Until she met the woman wearing the striped stole. Please keep
your temper, Nynaeve. We might as well be children—babes—facing our mother, and this Mother
can do far worse than beat us.
It seemed to her a way out was being offered in what the Amyrlin had said, but she was not sure
what way. “Mother, forgive me for speaking, but what do you intend to do to us?”
“Do to you, child? I intend to punish you and Elayne for leaving the Tower without permission,
and Nynaeve for leaving the city without permission. First, you will each be called to Sheriam
Sedai’s study, where I’ve told her to switch you till you wish you had a cushion to sit on for the next
week. I have already had this announced to the novices and the Accepted.”
Egwene blinked in surprise. Elayne gave an audible grunt, stiffened her back, and muttered
something under her breath. Nynaeve was the only one who seemed to take it without shock.
Punishment, whether extra labors or something else, was always between the Mistress of Novices
and whoever was called to her. Those were usually novices, but included the Accepted who stepped
far enough beyond the bounds. Sheriam always keeps it between you and her, Egwene thought
bleakly. She can’t have told everyone. But better than being imprisoned. Better than being stilled.
“The announcement is part of the punishment, of course,” the Amyrlin went on, as if she had read
Egwene’s mind. “I have also had it announced that you are all three assigned to the kitchens, to work
with the scullions, until further notice. And I have let it be whispered about that ‘further notice’ might
just mean the rest of your natural lives. Do I hear objections to any of this?”
“No, Mother,” Egwene said quickly. Nynaeve would hate scrubbing pots even more than the
other. It could be worse, Nynaeve. Light, it could be so much worse. Nynaeve’s nostrils had flared,
but she gave her head a tight shake.
“And you, Elayne?” the Amyrlin said. “The Daughter-Heir of Andor is used to gentler
treatment.”

“I want to be Aes Sedai, Mother,” Elayne said in a firm voice.
The Amyrlin fingered a paper in front of her on the table and seemed to study it for a moment.
When she raised her head, her smile was not at all pleasant. “If any of you had been silly enough to
answer otherwise, I had something to add to your tally that would have had you cursing your mother
for ever letting your father steal that first kiss. Letting yourselves be winkled out of the Tower like
thoughtless children. Even an infant would never have fallen into that trap. I will teach you to think
before you act, or else I’ll use you to chink cracks in the water gates!”
Egwene found herself offering silent thanks. A prickle ran over her skin as the Amyrlin
continued.
“Now, as to what else I intend to do with you. It seems you have all increased your ability to
channel remarkably since you left the Tower. You have learned much. Including some things,” she
added sharply, “that I intend to see you unlearn!”
Nynaeve surprised Egwene by saying, “I know we have done . . . things . . . we should not have,
Mother. I assure you, we will do our best to live as if we had taken the Three Oaths.”
The Amyrlin grunted. “See that you do,” she said dryly. “If I could, I’d put the Oath Rod in your
hands tonight, but as that is reserved for being raised to Aes Sedai, I must trust to your good sense—if
you have any—to keep you whole. As it is, you, Egwene, and you, Elayne, are to be raised to the
Accepted.”
Elayne gasped, and Egwene stammered a shocked, “Thank you, Mother.” Leane shifted where
she stood. Egwene did not think the Keeper looked best pleased. Not surprised—she had obviously
known it was coming—but not pleased, either.
“Do not thank me. Your abilities have gone too far for you to remain novices. Some will think
you should not have the ring, not after what you’ve done, but the sight of you up to your elbows in
greasy pots should mute the criticism. And lest you start thinking it’s some sort of reward, remember
that the first few weeks as one of the Accepted are used to pick the rotting fish out of the basket of
good ones. Your worst day as a novice will seem a fond dream compared to the least of your studies
over the next weeks. I suspect that some of the sisters who teach you will make your trials even worse
than they strictly must be, but I don’t believe you will complain. Will you?”
I can learn, Egwene thought. Choose my own studies. I can learn about the dreams, learn now
to . . .
The Amyrlin’s smile cut off her train of thought. That smile said nothing the sisters could do to
them would be worse than it needed to be, if it left them alive. Nynaeve’s face was a mixture of deep
sympathy and horrified remembrance of her own first weeks as one of the Accepted. The combination
was enough to make Egwene swallow hard. “No, Mother,” she said faintly. Elayne’s reply was a
hoarse whisper.
“Then that’s done. Your mother was not at all pleased by your disappearance, Elayne.”
“She knows?” Elayne squeaked.
Leane sniffed, and the Amyrlin arched an eyebrow, saying, “I could hardly keep it from her. You
missed her by less than a month, which may be as well for you. You might not have survived that
meeting. She was mad enough to chew through an oar, at you, at me, at the White Tower.”
“I can imagine, Mother,” Elayne said faintly.
“I don’t think you can, child. You may have ended a tradition that began before there was an
Andor. A custom stronger than most laws. Morgase refused to take Elaida back with her. For the first
time ever, the Queen of Andor does not have an Aes Sedai advisor. She demanded your immediate
return to Caemlyn as soon as you were found. I convinced her it would be safer for you to train here a

little longer. She was ready to remove your two brothers from their training with the Warders, too.
They talked their way out of that themselves. I still do not know how.”
Elayne seemed to be looking inward, perhaps seeing Morgase in all her anger. She shivered.
“Gawyn is my brother,” she said absently. “Galad is not.”
“Do not be childish,” the Amyrlin told her. “Sharing the same father makes Galad your brother,
too, whether or not you like him. I will not allow childishness out of you, girl. A measure of stupidity
can be tolerated in a novice; it is not allowed in one of the Accepted.”
“Yes, Mother,” Elayne said glumly.
“The Queen left a letter for you with Sheriam. Aside from giving you the rough side of her
tongue, I believe she states her intention of bringing you home as soon as it is safe for you. She is sure
that in a few more months at most you will be able to channel without risking killing yourself.”
“But I want to learn, Mother.” The iron had returned to Elayne’s voice. “I want to be Aes
Sedai.”
The Amyrlin’s smile was even grimmer than her last. “As well that you do, child, because I have
no intention of letting Morgase have you. You have the potential to be stronger than any Aes Sedai in
a thousand years, and I will not let you go until you achieve the shawl as well as the ring. Not if I
have to grind you into sausage to do it. I will not let you go. Do I make myself clear?”
“Yes, Mother.” Elayne sounded uneasy, and Egwene did not blame her. Caught between
Morgase and the White Tower like a towel between two dogs, caught between the Queen of Andor
and the Amyrlin Seat. If Egwene had ever envied Elayne her wealth and the throne she would one day
occupy, at that moment she surely did not.
The Amyrlin said briskly, “Leane, take Elayne down to Sheriam’s study. I have a few words yet
to say to these other two. Words I do not think they will enjoy hearing.”
Egwene exchanged startled looks with Nynaeve; for a moment, worry dissolved the tension
between them. What does she have to say to us and not to Elayne? she wondered. I do not care, so
long as she does not try to stop me learning. But why not Elayne, too?
Elayne grimaced at the mention of the Mistress of Novices’s study, but she drew herself up as
Leane came to her side. “As you command, Mother,” she said formally, lowering herself in a perfect
curtsy, skirts sweeping wide, “so shall I obey.” She followed Leane out with her head held high.

The Bite of the Thorns

The Amyrlin Seat did not speak at once—she walked to the tall, arched windows and looked
out across the balcony at the garden below, hands clasped tightly behind her. Minutes went by before
she spoke, still with her back to the two of them.
“I have kept the worst of it from getting out, but how long will that last? The servants do not
know of the stolen ter’angreal, and they do not connect the deaths with Liandrin and the others
leaving. It was not easy to manage that, gossip being what it is. They believe the deaths were the
work of Darkfriends. And so they were. Rumors are reaching the city, too. That Darkfriends got into
the Tower, that they did murder. There was no way to stop that. It does our reputation no good, but at
least it is better than the truth. At least none outside the Tower, and few inside, know Aes Sedai were
killed. Darkfriends in the White Tower. Faugh! I’ve spent my life denying that. I will not let them be
here. I will hook them, and gut them, and hang them out in the sun to dry.”
Nynaeve gave Egwene an uncertain look—half as uncertain as Egwene felt—then took a deep
breath. “Mother, are we to be punished more? Beyond what you’ve already sentenced us to?”
The Amyrlin looked over her shoulder at them; her eyes were lost in shadow. “Punished more?
You might well say that. Some will say I’ve given you a gift, raising you. Now feel the real bite of
that rose’s thorns.” She strode briskly back to her chair and sat down, then seemed to lose her urgency
again. Or to gain uncertainty.
To see the Amyrlin look uncertain made Egwene’s stomach clench. The Amyrlin Seat was
always sure, always serenely centered on her path. The Amyrlin was strength personified. For all her
own raw power, the woman on the other side of the table had the knowledge and experience to wind
her around a spindle. To see her suddenly wavering—like a girl who knew she had to dive head first
into a pond without any idea of how deep it was or whether there were rocks or mud on the bottom—
to see that, chilled Egwene right to her core. What does she mean, the real bite of the thorns? Light,
what does she mean to do to us?
Fingering a carved black box on the table in front of her, the Amyrlin peered at it as if looking at
something beyond. “It is a question of who I can trust,” she said softly. “I should be able to trust
Leane and Sheriam, at least. But do I dare? Verin?” Her shoulders shook with a quick, silent laugh. “I
already trust Verin with more than my life, but how far can I take it? Moiraine?” She was silent for a
moment. “I have always believed I could trust Moiraine.”
Egwene shifted uneasily. How much did the Amyrlin know? It was not the kind of thing she
could ask, not of the Amyrlin Seat. Do you know that a young man from my village, a man I used to
think I’d marry one day, is the Dragon Reborn? Do you know two of your Aes Sedai are helping
him? At least she was sure the Amyrlin did not know she had dreamed of him last night, running from
Moiraine. She thought she was sure. She kept silent.

“What are you talking about?” Nynaeve demanded. The Amyrlin looked up at her, and she
moderated her tone as she added, “Forgive me, Mother, but are we to be punished more? I do not
understand this talk of trust. If you want my opinion, Moiraine is not to be trusted.”
“That is your opinion, is it?” the Amyrlin said. “A year out of your village, and you think you
know enough of the world to choose which Aes Sedai to trust, and which not? A master sailor who’s
barely learned to hoist a sail!”
“She did not mean anything, Mother,” Egwene said, but she knew Nynaeve meant exactly what
she had said. She shot a warning glance at Nynaeve. Nynaeve gave her braid a sharp tug, but she kept
her mouth shut.
“Well, who is to say,” the Amyrlin mused. “Trust is as slippery as a basket of eels, sometimes.
The point is, you two are what I have to work with, thin reeds though you may be.”
Nynaeve’s mouth tightened, though her voice stayed level. “Thin reeds, Mother?”
The Amyrlin went on as if she had not spoken. “Liandrin tried to stuff you headfirst into a weir,
and it may well be she left because she learned you were returning, and could unmask her, so I have
to believe you aren’t—Black Ajah. I would rather eat scales and entrails,” she muttered, “but I
suppose I’ll have to get used to saying that name.”
Egwene gaped in shock—Black Ajah? Us? Light!—but Nynaeve barked, “We certainly are not!
How dare you say such a thing? How dare you even suggest it?”
“If you doubt me, child, go ahead!” the Amyrlin said in a hard voice. “You may have an Aes
Sedai’s power sometimes, but you are not yet Aes Sedai, not by miles. Well? Speak, if you have more
to say. I promise to leave you weeping for forgiveness! ‘Thin reed’? I’ll break you like a reed! I’ve
no patience left.”
Nynaeve’s mouth worked. Finally, though, she gave herself a shake, and drew a calming breath.
When she spoke her voice still had an edge, but a small one. “Forgive me, Mother. But you should not
—We are not—We would not do such a thing.”
With a compressed smile, the Amyrlin leaned back in her chair. “So you can keep your temper,
when you want to. I had to know that.” Egwene wondered how much of it had been a test; there was a
tightness around the Amyrlin’s eyes that suggested her patience might well be exhausted. “I wish I
could have found a way to raise you to the shawl, Daughter. Verin says you are already as strong as
any woman in the Tower.”
“The shawl!” Nynaeve gasped. “Aes Sedai? Me?”
The Amyrlin gestured slightly as if tossing something away, but she looked regretful to lose it.
“No point wishing for what can’t be. I could hardly raise you to full sister and send you to scrub pots
at the same time. And Verin also says you still cannot channel consciously unless you are furious. I
was ready to sever you from the True Source if you even looked like embracing saidar. The final
tests for the shawl require you to channel while maintaining utter calm under pressure. Extreme
pressure. Even I cannot—and would not—set that requirement aside.”
Nynaeve seemed stunned. She was staring at the Amyrlin with her mouth hanging open.
“I don’t understand, Mother,” Egwene said after a moment.
“I suppose you don’t, at that. You are the only two in the Tower I can be absolutely sure are not
Black Ajah.” The Amyrlin’s mouth still twisted around those words. “Liandrin and her twelve went,
but did all of them go? Or did they leave some of their number behind, like a stub in shallow water
that you don’t see till it puts a hole in your boat? It may be I’ll not find that out until it is too late, but I
will not let Liandrin and the others get away with what they did. Not the theft, and especially not the
murders. No one kills my people and walks away unscathed. And I’ll not let thirteen trained Aes

Sedai serve the Shadow. I mean to find them, and still them!”
“I don’t see what that has to do with us,” Nynaeve said slowly. She did not look as if she liked
what she was thinking.
“Just this, child. You two are to be my hounds, hunting the Black Ajah. No one will believe it of
you, not a pair of half-trained Accepted I humiliated publicly.”
“That is crazy!” Nynaeve’s eyes had opened wide by the time the Amyrlin reached the words
“Black Ajah,” and her knuckles were white from her grip on her braid. She bit her words off and spat
them: “They are all full Aes Sedai. Egwene hasn’t even been raised to Accepted yet, and you know I
cannot channel enough to light a candle unless I am angry, not of my own free will. What chance
would we have?”
Egwene nodded agreement. Her tongue had stuck to the roof of her mouth. Hunt the Black Ajah?
I’d rather hunt a bear with a switch! She’s just trying to scare us, to punish us more. She has to
be! If that was what the Amyrlin was trying, she was succeeding all too well.
The Amyrlin was nodding, too. “Every word you say is true. But each of you is more than a
match for Liandrin in sheer power, and she is the strongest of them. Yet they are trained, and you are
not, and you, Nynaeve, do have limitations, as yet. But when you don’t have an oar, child, any plank
will do to paddle the boat ashore.”
“But I would be useless,” Egwene blurted. Her voice came out as a squeak, but she was too
afraid to be ashamed. She means it! Oh, Light, she means it! Liandrin gave me to the Seanchan, and
now she wants me to hunt thirteen like her? “My studies, my lessons, working in the kitchens. Anaiya
Sedai will surely want to continue testing me to see if I am a Dreamer. I’ll barely have time left over
to sleep and eat. How can I hunt anything?”
“You will have to find the time,” the Amyrlin said, cool and serene once more, as if hunting the
Black Ajah were no more than sweeping a floor. “As one of the Accepted, you choose your own
studies, within limits, and the times for them. And the rules are a little easier for Accepted. A little
easier. They must be found, child.”
Egwene looked to Nynaeve, but what Nynaeve said was, “Why is Elayne not part of this? It can’t
be because you think she is Black Ajah. Is it because she is Daughter-Heir of Andor?”
“A full net on the first cast, child. I would make her one of you if I could, but at the moment
Morgase gives me enough problems as it is. When I have her combed and curried and prodded back
on the proper path, perhaps Elayne will join you. Perhaps then.”
“Then leave Egwene out, too,” Nynaeve said. “She is barely old enough to be a woman. I will
do your hunting for you.” Egwene made a sound of protest—I am a woman!—but the Amyrlin spoke
before her.
“I am not setting you out as bait, child. If I had a hundred of you, I would still not be happy, but
there are only you two, so two I will have.”
“Nynaeve,” Egwene said, “I do not understand you. Do you mean you want to do this?”
“It isn’t that I want to,” Nynaeve said wearily, “but I’d rather hunt them than sit wondering if the
Aes Sedai teaching me is really a Darkfriend. And whatever they are up to, I do not want to wait until
they’re ready to find out what it is.”
The decision Egwene came to twisted her stomach. “Then I will do it, too. I don’t want to sit
wondering and waiting any more than you do.” Nynaeve opened her mouth, and Egwene felt a flash of
anger; it was such a relief after fear. “And don’t you dare say I’m too young again. At least I can
channel when I want to. Most of the time. I am not a little girl anymore, Nynaeve.”
Nynaeve stood there, jerking on her braid and not saying a word. Finally the stiffness drained out

of her. “You are not, are you? I have said myself you are a woman, but I suppose I did not really
believe it, inside. Girl, I—No, woman. Woman, I hope you realize you’ve climbed into a pickling
cauldron with me, and the fire may be lit.”
“I know it.” Egwene was proud that her voice hardly shook at all.
The Amyrlin smiled as if pleased, but there was something in her blue eyes that made Egwene
suspect she had known what their decisions would be all along. For an instant, she felt those
puppeteer’s strings on her arms and legs again.
“Verin. . . .” The Amyrlin hesitated, then muttered half to herself. “If I must trust someone, it
might as well be her. She knows as much as I already, and maybe more.” Her voice strengthened.
“Verin will give you all that is known of Liandrin and the others, and also a list of the ter’angreal
that were taken, and what they will do. Those that we know. As for any of the Black Ajah still in the
Tower. . . . Listen, watch, and be careful of your questions. Be like mice. If you have even a
suspicion, report it to me. I will keep an eye on you myself. No one will think that strange, given what
you’re being punished for. You can make your reports when I look in on you. Remember, they have
killed before. They could easily kill again.”
“That’s all very well,” Nynaeve said, “but we will still be Accepted, and it is Aes Sedai we’re
after. Any full sister can tell us to go about our business, or send us off to do her laundry, and we will
have no choice but to obey. There are places Accepted are not supposed to go, things we’re not
supposed to do. Light, if we were sure a sister was Black Ajah, she could tell the guards to lock us in
our rooms and keep us there, and they would do it. They certainly would not take the word of an
Accepted over that of an Aes Sedai.”
“For the most part,” the Amyrlin said, “you must work within the limitations of the Accepted.
The idea is for no one to suspect you. But. . . .”She opened the black box on her table, hesitated and
looked at the other two women as if still unsure she wanted to do this, then took out a number of stiff,
folded papers. Sorting through them carefully, she hesitated again, then chose out two. The remainder
she shoved back into the box, and handed those two to Egwene and Nynaeve. “Keep these well
hidden. They are for an emergency only.”
Egwene unfolded her thick paper. It held writing in a neat, round hand, and was sealed at the
bottom with the White Flame of Tar Valon.
What the bearer does is done at my order and by my authority. Obey, and keep silent, at my
command.

“I could do anything with this,” Nynaeve said in a wondering voice. “Order the guards to march.
Command the Warders.” She gave a little laugh. “I could make a Warder dance, with this.”
“Until I found out about it,” the Amyrlin agreed dryly. “Unless you had a very convincing reason,
I’d make you wish Liandrin had caught you.”
“I didn’t mean to do any of that,” Nynaeve said hastily. “I just meant that it gives more authority
than I had imagined.”
“You may need every shred of it. But just you remember, child. A Darkfriend won’t heed that
any more than a Whitecloak would. They would both likely kill you just for having it. If that paper is a
shield . . . well, paper shields are flimsy, and this one may have a target painted on it.”

“Yes, Mother,” Egwene and Nynaeve said together. Egwene folded her paper up and tucked it
into her belt pouch, resolving not to take it out again unless she absolutely had to. And how will I
know when that is?
“What about Mat?” Nynaeve asked. “He’s very sick, Mother, and he does not have much time
left.”
“I will send word to you,” the Amyrlin said curtly.
“But, Mother—”
“I will send word to you! Now, off with you, children. The hope of the Tower rests in your
hands. Go to your rooms and get some rest. Remember, you have appointments with Sheriam, and
with the pots.”

CHAPTER
15

The Gray Man

Outside the Amyrlin Seat’s study, Egwene and Nynaeve found the corridors empty except for
an occasional serving woman, hurrying about her duties on soft-slippered feet. Egwene was grateful
for their presence. The halls suddenly seemed like caverns, for all the tapestries and stonework.
Dangerous caverns.
Nynaeve strode along purposefully, tugging at her braid fitfully again, and Egwene hurried to
keep up. She did not want to be left alone.
“If the Black Ajah is still here, Nynaeve, and if they even suspect what we’re doing. . . . I hope
you didn’t mean what you said about acting as if we are already bound by the Three Oaths. I don’t
intend to let them kill me, not if I can stop it by channeling.”
“If any of them are still here, Egwene, they will know what we are doing as soon as they see us.”
Despite what she was saying, Nynaeve sounded preoccupied. “Or at least they will see us as a threat,
and that’s much the same thing as far as what they will do.”
“How will they see us as a threat? Nobody is threatened by someone they can order about.
Nobody is threatened by someone who has to scrub pots and turn the spits three times a day. That’s
why the Amyrlin is putting us to work in the kitchens. Part of the reason, anyway.”
“Perhaps the Amyrlin did not think it through,” Nynaeve said absently. “Or perhaps she did, and
means something different for us than what she claims. Think, Egwene. Liandrin would not have tried
to put us out of the way unless she thought we were a threat to her. I can’t imagine how, or to what,
but I cannot see how it could have changed, either. If there are any Black Ajah still here, they will
surely see us the same way, whether they suspect what we’re doing or not.”
Egwene swallowed. “I hadn’t thought of that. Light, I wish I were invisible. Nynaeve, if they are
still after us, I will risk being stilled before I let Darkfriends kill me, or maybe worse. And I won’t
believe you will let them take you, either, no matter what you told the Amyrlin.”
“I meant it.” For a moment Nynaeve seemed to rouse from her thoughts. Her steps slowed. A
pale-haired novice carrying a tray rushed past. “I meant every word, Egwene.” Nynaeve went on
when the novice was out of hearing. “There are other ways to defend ourselves. If there were not,
Aes Sedai would be killed every time they left the Tower. We just have to reason those ways out, and
use them.”
“I know several ways already, and so do you.”
“They are dangerous.” Egwene opened her mouth to say they were only dangerous to whoever
attacked her, but Nynaeve plowed on over her. “You can come to like them too much. When I let out
all my anger at those Whitecloaks this morning. . . . It felt too good. It is too dangerous.” She shivered
and quickened her pace again, and Egwene had to step lively to catch up.
“You sound like Sheriam. You never have before. You have pushed every limit they’ve put on

you. Why would you accept limits now, when we might have to ignore them to stay alive?”
“What good if it ends with us being put out of the Tower? Stilled or not, what good then?”
Nynaeve’s voice dropped as if she were speaking to herself. “I can do it. I must, if I’m to stay here
long enough to learn, and I must learn if I’m to—” Suddenly she seemed to realize she was speaking
aloud. She shot a hard look at Egwene, and her voice firmed. “Let me think. Please, be quiet and let
me think.”
Egwene held her tongue, but inside she bubbled with unasked questions. What special reason did
Nynaeve have for wanting to learn more of what the White Tower could teach? What was it she
wanted to do? Why was Nynaeve keeping it secret from her? Secrets. We’ve learned to keep too
many secrets since coming to the Tower. The Amyrlin is keeping secrets from us, too. Light, what
is she going to do about Mat?
Nynaeve accompanied her all the way back to the novices’ quarters, not turning aside to the
Accepted’s quarters. The galleries were still empty, and they met no one as they climbed the spiraling
ramps.
As they came up on Elayne’s room, Nynaeve stopped, knocked once, and immediately opened
the door and put her head inside. Then she was letting the white door swing shut and striding toward
the next, Egwene’s room. “She isn’t here yet,” she said. “I need to talk to both of you.”
Egwene caught her shoulders and pulled her to an abrupt halt. “What—?” Something tugged at
her hair, stung her ear. A black blur streaked in front of her face to clang against the wall, and in the
next breath Nynaeve was bearing her to the gallery floor, behind the railing.
Wide-eyed and sprawling, Egwene stared at what lay on the stone in front of her door, where it
had fallen. A bolt from a crossbow. A few dark strands from her hair were tangled in the four heavy
prongs, meant for punching through armor. She raised a trembling hand to touch her ear, to touch the
tiniest nick, damp with a bead of blood. If I had not stopped just then. . . . If I hadn’t. . . . The
quarrel would have gone right through her head, and would probably have killed Nynaeve, too.
“Blood and ashes!” she gasped. “Blood and bloody ashes!”
“Watch your language,” Nynaeve admonished, but her heart was not in it. She lay peering
between the white stone balusters toward the far side of the galleries. A glow surrounded her, to
Egwene’s eyes. She had embraced saidar.
Hastily, Egwene tried to reach out for the One Power, too, but at first haste defeated her. Haste,
and images that kept intruding on the emptiness, images of her head being ripped apart like a rotten
melon by a heavy quarrel that went on to bury itself in Nynaeve. She took a deep breath and tried
again, and finally the rose floated in nothingness, opened to the True Source, and the Power filled her.
She rolled onto her stomach to peer through the railing beside Nynaeve. “Do you see anything?
Do you see him? I’ll put a lightning bolt through him!” She could feel it building, pressing on her to
loose it. “It is a man, isn’t it?” She could not imagine a man coming into the novices’ quarters, but it
was impossible to picture a woman carrying a crossbow through the Tower.
“I don’t know.” Quiet anger filled Nynaeve’s voice; her anger was always at its worst when she
grew quiet with it. “I thought I saw—Yes! There!” Egwene felt the Power pulse in the other woman,
and then Nynaeve was unhurriedly getting to her feet, brushing at her dress as if there were nothing
more to worry about.
Egwene stared at her. “What? What did you do? Nynaeve?”
“ ‘Of the Five Powers,’ ” Nynaeve said in a lecturing tone, faintly mocking, “ ‘Air, sometimes
called Wind, is thought by many to be of the least use. This is far from true.’ ” She finished with a
tight laugh. “I told you there were other ways to defend ourselves. I used Air, to hold him with air. If

it is a he; I could not see him clearly. A trick the Amyrlin showed me once, though I doubt she
expected me to see how it was done. Well, are you going to lie there all day?”
Egwene scrambled up to hurry after her around the gallery. Before long a man did come into
sight around the curve, dressed in plain brown breeches and coat. He stood facing the other way,
balanced on the ball of one foot, with the other hanging in midair as if he had been caught in the
middle of running. The man would feel as if he were buried in thick jelly, yet it was nothing but air
stiffened around him. Egwene remembered the Amyrlin’s trick, too, but she did not think she could
duplicate it. Nynaeve only had to see a thing done once to know how to do it herself. When she could
manage to channel at all, of course.
They came closer, and Egwene’s melding with the Power vanished in shock. The hilt of a dagger
stood out from the man’s chest. His face sagged, and death had already filmed his half-closed eyes.
He crumpled to the gallery floor as Nynaeve loosed the trap that had held him.
He was an average-appearing man, of average height and average build, with features so
ordinary Egwene did not think she would have noticed him in a group of three. She only studied him a
moment, though, before realizing that something was missing. A crossbow.
She gave a start and looked about wildly. “There had to be another one, Nynaeve. Somebody
took the crossbow. And somebody stabbed him. He could be out there ready to shoot at us again.”
“Calm yourself,” Nynaeve said, but she peered both ways along the gallery, jerking at her braid.
“Just be calm, and we will figure out what to—” Her words cut off at the sound of steps on the ramp
leading up to their level.
Egwene’s heart pounded, seemingly in her throat. Eyes fastened on the head of the ramp, she
desperately strove to touch saidar again, but for her that required calm, and her heartbeats shattered
calm.
Sheriam Sedai stopped at the top of the ramp, frowning at what she saw. “What in the name of
the Light has happened here?” She hurried forward, her serenity gone for once.
“We found him,” Nynaeve said as the Mistress of Novices knelt beside the corpse.
Sheriam put a hand to the man’s chest, and jerked it back twice as fast, hissing. Steeling herself
visibly, she touched him again, and maintained the Touch longer. “Dead,” she muttered. “As dead as
it is possible to be, and more.” When she straightened, she pulled a handkerchief from her sleeve and
wiped her fingers. “You found him? Here? Like this?”
Egwene nodded, sure that if she spoke, Sheriam would hear the lie in her voice.
“We did,” Nynaeve said firmly.
Sheriam shook her head. “A man—a dead man, at that!—in the novices’ quarters would be
scandal enough, but this . . . !”
“What makes him different?” Nynaeve asked. “And how could he be more than dead?”
Sheriam took a deep breath, and gave them each a searching look. “He is one of the Soulless. A
Gray Man.” Absently, she wiped her fingers again, her eyes going back to the body. Worried eyes.
“The Soulless?” Egwene said, a tremor in her voice, at the same time that Nynaeve said, “A
Gray Man?”
Sheriam glanced at them, a look as penetrating as it was brief. “Not a part of your studies, yet,
but you seem to have gone beyond the rules in a great many ways. And considering you found this.
. . .” She gestured to the corpse. “The Soulless, the Gray Men, give up their souls to serve the Dark
One as assassins. They are not really alive, after that. Not quite dead, but not truly alive. And despite
the name, some Gray Men are women. A very few. Even among Darkfriends, only a handful of
women are stupid enough to make that sacrifice. You can look right at them and hardly notice them,

until it is too late. He was as much as dead while he walked. Now, only my eyes tell me that what is
lying there ever lived at all.” She gave them another long look. “No Gray Man has dared enter Tar
Valon since the Trolloc Wars.”
“What will you do?” Egwene asked. Sheriam’s brows rose, and she quickly added, “If I may
ask, Sheriam Sedai.”
The Aes Sedai hesitated. “I suppose you may, since you had the bad luck to find him. It will be
up to the Amyrlin Seat, but with everything that has happened, I believe she will want to keep this as
quiet as is possible. We do not need more rumors. You will speak of this to none but me, or to the
Amyrlin, should she mention it first.”
“Yes, Aes Sedai,” Egwene said fervently. Nynaeve’s voice was cooler.
Sheriam appeared to take their obedience for granted. She gave no sign of having heard them.
Her attention was all on the dead man. The Gray Man. The Soulless. “There will be no hiding the fact
that a man was killed here.” The glow of the One Power suddenly surrounded her, and just as
abruptly, a long, low dome covered the body on the floor, grayish and so opaque that it was hard to
see there was a body under it. “But this will keep anyone else from touching him who can discover
his nature. I must have this removed before the novices come back.”
Her tilted green eyes regarded them as if she had just remembered their presence. “You two go,
now. To your room, I think, Nynaeve. Considering what you are already facing, if it became known
you were involved in this, even on the edge of it. . . . Go.”
Egwene curtsied, and tugged at Nynaeve’s sleeve, but Nynaeve said, “Why did you come up
here, Sheriam Sedai?”
For a moment Sheriam looked startled, but on the instant she frowned. Fists on her hips, she
regarded Nynaeve with all the firmness of her office. “Does the Mistress of Novices now need an
excuse for coming to the novices’ quarters, Accepted?” she said softly. “Do Accepted now question
Aes Sedai? The Amyrlin means to make something of you two, but whether she does or not, I will
teach you manners, at least. Now, the pair of you, go, before I haul you both down to my study, and
not for the appointment the Amyrlin Seat has already set for you.”
A sudden thought came to Egwene. “Forgive me, Sheriam Sedai,” she said quickly, “but I must
fetch my cloak. I feel cold.” She rushed away, around the gallery before the Aes Sedai could speak.
If Sheriam found that crossbow bolt in front of her door, there would be too many questions. No
pretending they had only found the man, that he had no connection to her, then. But when she reached
the door to her room, the heavy bolt was gone. Only the jagged chip in the stone beside the door said
it had ever been there.
Egwene’s skin crawled. How could anyone take it without one of us seeing. . . . Another Gray
Man! She had embraced saidar before she knew it, only the sweet flow of the Power inside her
telling her what she had done. Even so, it was one of the hardest things she had ever done, opening
that door and going into her room. There was no one there. She snatched the white cloak off its peg
and ran out, anyway, and she did not release saidar until she was halfway back to the others.
Something more had passed between the women while she was gone. Nynaeve was attempting to
appear meek, and succeeding only in looking as if she had a sour stomach. Sheriam had her fists on
her hips and was tapping her foot irritably, and the stare she was giving Nynaeve, like green
millstones ready to start grinding barley flour, took in Egwene equally.
“Forgive me, Sheriam Sedai,” she said hastily, dropping a curtsy and settling her cloak on her
shoulders at the same time. “This . . . finding a dead man—a . . . a Gray Man!—it made me cold. If
we may go now?”

At Sheriam’s tight nod of dismissal, Nynaeve made a bare curtsy. Egwene seized her arm and
hustled her away.
“Are you trying to make more trouble for us?” she demanded when they were two levels down.
And safely out of earshot of Sheriam, she hoped. “What else did you say to her, to make her glare like
that? More questions, I suppose? I hope you learned something worth making her mad at us.”
“She would not say anything,” Nynaeve muttered. “We must ask questions if we are to do any
good, Egwene. We will have to take a few chances, or we’ll never learn anything.”
Egwene sighed. “Well, be a little more circumspect.” From the set of Nynaeve’s face, the other
woman had no intention of going easy or avoiding risks. Egwene sighed again. “The crossbow bolt
was gone, Nynaeve. It must have been another Gray Man who took it.”
“So that is why you. . . . Light!” Nynaeve frowned and gave a sharp tug to her braid.
After a time Egwene said, “What was that she did to cover the . . . the body?” She did not want
to think of it as a Gray Man; that reminded her there was another one out there. She did not want to
think of anything at all, right then.
“Air,” Nynaeve replied. “She used Air. A neat trick, and I think I see how to make something
useful with it.”
The use of the One Power was divided into the Five Powers: Earth, Air, Fire, Water, and Spirit.
Different Talents required different combinations of the Five Powers. “I don’t understand some of the
ways the Five Powers are combined. Take Healing. I can see why it requires Spirit, and maybe Air,
but why Water?”
Nynaeve rounded on her. “What are you babbling about? Have you forgotten what we’re doing?”
She looked around. They had reached the Accepted’s quarters, a stack of galleries lower than the
novices’ quarters, surrounding a garden rather than a court. There was no one in sight except for
another Accepted, hurrying along on another level, but she lowered her voice. “Have you forgotten
the Black Ajah?”
“I am trying to forget it,” Egwene said fiercely. “For a little while, anyway. I am trying to forget
that we just left a dead man. I’m trying to forget that he almost killed me, and that he has a companion
who might try it again.” She touched her ear; the drop of blood had dried, but the nick still hurt. “We
are lucky we aren’t both dead right now.”
Nynaeve’s face softened, but when she spoke her voice held something of the time when she had
been the Wisdom of Emond’s Field, saying words that had to be said for someone’s own good.
“Remember that body, Egwene. Remember that he tried to kill you. Kill us. Remember the Black
Ajah. Remember them all the time. Because if you forget, just once, the next time, it may be you lying
dead.”
“I know,” Egwene sighed. “But I do not have to like it.”
“Did you notice what Sheriam did not mention?”
“No. What?”
“She never wondered who stabbed him. Now, come on. My room is just down here, and you can
put your feet up while we talk.”

CHAPTER

Hunters Three

Nynaeve’s room was considerably larger than the novice rooms. She had a real bed, not one
built into the wall, two ladder-back armchairs instead of a stool, and a wardrobe for her clothes. The
furnishings were all plain, suitable for a middling successful farmer’s house, but compared to the
novices, the Accepted lived in luxury. There was even a small rug, woven with scrolls of yellow and
red on blue. The room was not empty when Egwene and Nynaeve entered.
Elayne stood in front of the fireplace, arms crossed beneath her breasts and eyes red at least
partly from anger. Two tall young men sprawled in the chairs, all arms and legs. One, with his dark
green coat undone to show a snowy shirt, shared Elayne’s blue eyes and red-gold hair, and his
grinning face marked him plainly as her brother. The other, Nynaeve’s age and with his gray coat
neatly buttoned, was slender and dark of hair and eye. He rose, all sure confidence and lithely
muscled grace, when Egwene and Nynaeve came in. He was, Egwene thought not for the first time,
the most handsome man she had ever seen. His name was Galad.
“It is good to see you again,” he said, taking her hand. “I have worried much over you. We have
worried much.”
Her pulse quickened, and she took back her hand before he should feel it. “Thank you, Galad,”
she murmured. Light, but he’s beautiful. She told herself to stop thinking that way. It was not easy.
She found herself smoothing her dress, wishing he were seeing her in silk instead of this plain white
wool, perhaps even one of those Domani dresses Min had told her of, the ones that clung and seemed
so thin you thought they must be transparent even though they were not. She flushed furiously and
banished the image from her mind, willed him to look away from her face. It did not help that half the
women in the Tower, from scullery maids to Aes Sedai themselves, looked at him as if they had the
same thoughts. It did not help that his smile seemed for her alone. In fact, his smile made it worse.
Light, if he even suspected what I was thinking, I’d die!
The golden-haired young man leaned forward in his chair. “The question is, where have you
been? Elayne dodges my questions as if she has a pocket full of figs and doesn’t want me to have
any.”
“I have told you, Gawyn,” Elayne said in a tight voice, “it is none of your affair. I came here,”
she added to Nynaeve, “because I did not want to be alone. They saw me, and followed. They would
not take no for an answer.”
“Wouldn’t they,” Nynaeve said flatly.
“But it is our affair, sister,” Galad said. “Your safety is very much our affair.” He looked at
Egwene, and she felt her heart jump. “The safety of all of you is very important to me. To us.”
“I am not your sister,” Elayne snapped.
“If you want company,” Gawyn told Elayne with a smile, “we can do as well as any. And after

what we went through just to be here, we deserve some explanation of where you’ve been. I would
rather let Galad thump me all over the practice yard all day than face Mother again for a single
minute. I’d rather have Coulin mad at me.” Coulin was Master of Arms, and kept a tight discipline
among the young men who came to train at the White Tower whether they aspired to become Warders
or just to learn from them.
“Deny the connection if you will,” Galad told Elayne gravely, “but it is still there. And Mother
put your safety in our hands.”
Gawyn grimaced. “She’ll have our hides, Elayne, if anything happens to you. We had to talk fast,
or she’d have hauled us back home with her. I have never heard of a queen sending her own sons to
the headsman, but Mother sounded ready to make an exception if we don’t bring you home safely.”
“I am sure,” Elayne said, “that your fast talk was all for me. None of it was meant to let you stay
here studying with the Warders.” Gawyn’s face reddened.
“Your safety was our first concern.” Galad sounded as if he meant it, and Egwene was sure he
did. “We managed to convince Mother that if you did return here, you would need someone to look
after you.”
“Look after me!” Elayne exclaimed, but Galad went on smoothly.
“The White Tower has become a dangerous place. There have been deaths—murders—with no
real explanations. Even some Aes Sedai have been killed, though they have tried to keep that quiet.
And I have heard rumors of the Black Ajah, spoken in the Tower itself. By Mother’s command, when
it is safe for you to leave your training, we are to return you to Caemlyn.”
For answer, Elayne lifted her chin and half turned away from him.
Gawyn ran a hand through his hair in frustration. “Light, Nynaeve, Galad and I are not villains.
All we want to do is help. We would do it anyway, but Mother commanded it, so there’s no chance of
you talking us out of it.”
“Morgase’s commands carry no weight in Tar Valon,” Nynaeve said in a level voice. “As for
your offer of help, I will remember it. Should we need help, you will be among the first to hear of it.
For now, I wish you to leave.” She gestured pointedly to the door, but he ignored her.
“That is all very well, but Mother will want to know Elayne has come back. And why she ran off
without a word, and what she was doing these months. Light, Elayne! The whole Tower was in a
turmoil. Mother was half-crazed with fear. I thought she’d tear the Tower down with her bare hands.”
Elayne’s face took on a measure of guilt, and Gawyn pressed his advantage. “You owe her that much,
Elayne. You owe me that much. Burn me, you’re being as stubborn as stone. You’ve been gone for
months, and all I know about it is that you’ve run afoul of Sheriam. And the only reasons I know that
much are because you’ve been crying and you won’t sit down.” Elayne’s indignant stare said he had
squandered whatever momentary advantage he might have had.
“Enough,” Nynaeve said. Galad and Gawyn opened their mouths. She raised her voice. “I said
enough!” She glared at them until it was clear their silence would hold, then went on. “Elayne owes
the two of you nothing. Since she chooses to tell you nothing, that is that. Now, this is my room, not
the common room of an inn, and I want you out of it.”
“But, Elayne—” Gawyn began at the same time that Galad said, “We only want—”
Nynaeve spoke loudly enough to drown them out. “I doubt you asked permission to enter the
Accepted’s quarters.” They stared at her, looking surprised. “I thought not. You will be out of my
room, out of my sight, before I count three, or I will write a note to the Master of Arms about this.
Coulin Gaidin has a much stronger arm than Sheriam Sedai, and you may be assured that I will be
there to see he makes a proper job of it.”

“Nynaeve, you wouldn’t—” Gawyn began worriedly, but Galad motioned him to silence and
stepped closer to Nynaeve.
Her face kept its stern expression, but she unconsciously smoothed the front of her dress as he
smiled down at her. Egwene was not surprised. She did not think she had met a woman outside the
Red Ajah who would not be affected by Galad’s smile.
“I apologize, Nynaeve, for our forcing ourselves on you unwanted,” he said smoothly. “We will
go, of course. But remember that we are here if you need us. And whatever caused you to run away,
we can help with that, as well.”
Nynaeve returned his smile. “One,” she said.
Galad blinked, his smile fading. Calmly, he turned to Egwene. Gawyn got up and started for the
door. “Egwene,” Galad said, “you know that you, especially, can call on me at any time, for anything.
I hope you know that.”
“Two,” Nynaeve said.
Galad gave her an irritated look. “We will talk again,” he told Egwene, bowing over her hand.
With a last smile, he took an unhurried step toward the door.
“Thrrrrrrrrr”—Gawyn darted through the door, and even Galad’s graceful stride quickened
markedly—“ree,” Nynaeve finished as the door banged shut behind them.
Elayne clapped her hands delightedly. “Oh, well done,” she said. “Very well done. I did not
even know men were forbidden the Accepted’s quarters, too.”
“They aren’t,” Nynaeve said dryly, “but those louts did not know it, either.” Elayne clapped her
hands again and laughed. “I’d have let them just leave,” Nynaeve added, “if Galad had not made such
a show of taking his time about it. That young man has too fair a face for his own good.” Egwene
almost laughed at that; Galad was no more than a year younger that Nynaeve, if that, and Nynaeve was
straightening her dress again.
“Galad!” Elayne sniffed. “He’ll bother us again, and I do not know whether your trick will work
more than once. He does what he sees as right no matter who it hurts, even himself.”
“Then I will think of something else,” Nynaeve said. “We can’t afford to have them looking over
our shoulders all the time. Elayne, if you wish, I can make a salve that will soothe you.”
Elayne shook her head, then lay down across the bed with her chin in her hands. “If Sheriam
found out, we would no doubt both have yet another visit to her study to look forward to. You have
not said very much, Egwene. Cat caught your tongue?” Her expression became grimmer. “Or perhaps
Galad has?”
Egwene blushed in spite of herself. “I simply did not choose to argue with them,” she said in as
dignified a tone as she could manage.
“Of course,” Elayne said grudgingly. “I will admit that Galad is good-looking. But he is horrid,
too. He always does right, as he sees it I know that does not sound horrid, but it is. He has never
disobeyed Mother, not in the smallest thing that I know of. He will not tell a lie, even a small one, or
break a rule. If he turns you in for breaking one, there isn’t the slightest spite in it—he seems sad you
could not live up to his standards, if anything—but that doesn’t change the fact that he will turn you
in.”
“That sounds—uncomfortable,” Egwene said carefully, “but not horrid. I cannot imagine Galad
doing anything horrid.”
Elayne shook her head, as if in disbelief that Egwene found it so hard to see what was clear to
her. “If you want to pay attention to someone, try Gawyn. He is nice enough—most of the time—and
he’s besotted with you.”

“Gawyn! He has never looked at me twice.”
“Of course not, you fool, the way you stare at Galad until your eyes look ready to fall out of your
face.” Egwene’s cheeks felt hot, but she was afraid it might well be true. “Galad saved his life when
Gawyn was a child,” Elayne went on. “Gawyn will never admit he is interested in a woman if Galad
is interested in her, but I have heard him talk about you, and I know. He never could hide things from
me.”
“That is nice to know,” Egwene said, then laughed at Elayne’s grin. “Perhaps I can get him to
say some of those things to me instead of you.”
“You could choose Green Ajah, you know. Green sisters sometimes marry. Gawyn truly is
besotted, and you would be good for him. Besides, I would like to have you for a sister.”
“If you two are finished with girlish chatter,” Nynaeve cut in, “there are important matters to talk
about.”
“Yes,” Elayne said, “such as what the Amyrlin Seat had to say to you after I left.”
“I would rather not talk about that,” Egwene said awkwardly. She did not like lying to Elayne.
“She did not say anything that was pleasant.”
Elayne gave a sniff of disbelief. “Most people think I get off easier than the others because I am
Daughter-Heir of Andor. The truth is that if anything, I catch it harder than the rest because I’m
Daughter-Heir. Neither of you did anything I did not, and if the Amyrlin had harsh words for you, she
would have twice as harsh for me. Now, what did she say?”
“You must keep this just between us three,” Nynaeve said. “The Black Ajah—”
“Nynaeve!” Egwene exclaimed. “The Amyrlin said Elayne was to be left out of it!”
“The Black Ajah!” Elayne almost shouted, scrambling up to kneel in the middle of the bed. “You
cannot leave me out after telling me this much. I won’t be left out.”
“I never meant for you to be,” Nynaeve assured her. Egwene could only stare at her in
amazement. “Egwene, it was you and I who Liandrin saw as a threat. It was you and I who were just
nearly killed—”
“Nearly killed?” Elayne whispered.
“—perhaps because we are still a threat, and perhaps because they already know that we were
closeted alone with the Amyrlin, and even what she told us. We need someone with us who they do
not know about, and if she isn’t known to the Amyrlin, either, so much the better. I am not sure we can
trust the Amyrlin much further than the Black Ajah. She means to use us for her own ends. I mean to
see she doesn’t use us up. Can you understand that?”
Egwene nodded reluctantly. Just the same, she said, “It will be dangerous, Elayne, as dangerous
as anything we faced in Falme. Maybe more so. You do not have to be part of it, this time.”
“I know that,” Elayne said quietly. She paused, then went on. “When Andor goes to war, the
First Prince of the Sword commands the army, but the Queen rides with them, too. Seven hundred
years ago, at the Battle of Cuallin Dhen, the Andormen were being routed when Queen Modrellein
rode, alone and unarmed, carrying the Lion banner into the midst of the Tairen army. The Andormen
rallied and attacked once more, to save her, and won the battle. That is the kind of courage expected
of the Queen of Andor. If I have not learned to control my fear yet, I must before I take my mother’s
place on the Lion Throne.” Suddenly her somber mood vanished in a giggle. “Besides, do you think I
would pass up an adventure so I could scrub pots?”
“You will do that anyway,” Nynaeve told her, “and hope that everyone thinks that is all you are
doing. Now listen carefully.”
Elayne listened, and her mouth slowly dropped open as Nynaeve unfolded what the Amyrlin

Seat had told them, and the task she had laid on them, and the attempt on their lives. She shivered over
the Gray Man, and read the document the Amyrlin had given Nynaeve with a look of wonder, then
returned it, murmuring, “I wish I could have that when I face Mother next.” By the time Nynaeve
finished, though, her face was a picture of indignation.
“Why, that’s like being told to go up in the hills and find lions, only you do not know whether
there are any lions, but if there are, they may be hunting you, and they may be disguised as bushes. Oh,
and if you find any lions, try not to let them eat you before you can tell where they are.”
“If you are afraid,” Nynaeve said, “you can still stand aside. It will be too late, once you’ve
begun.”
Elayne tossed her head back. “Of course I am afraid. I am not a fool. But not afraid enough to
quit before I have even started.”
“There is something else, too,” Nynaeve said. “I am afraid the Amyrlin may mean to let Mat
die.”
“But an Aes Sedai is supposed to Heal anyone who asks.” The Daughter-Heir seemed caught
between indignation and disbelief. “Why would she let Mat die? I cannot believe it! I will not!”
“Nor can I!” Egwene gasped. She could not have meant that! The Amyrlin couldn’t let him die!
“All the way here Verin said that the Amyrlin would see he was Healed.”
Nynaeve shook her head. “Verin said the Amyrlin would ‘see to him.’ That is not the same thing.
And the Amyrlin avoided saying yes or no when I asked her. Maybe she has not made her mind up.”
“But why?” Elayne asked.
“Because the White Tower does what it does for its own reasons.” Nynaeve’s voice made
Egwene shiver. “I do not know why. Whether they help Mat live or let him die depends on what
serves their ends. None of the Three Oaths says they have to Heal him. Mat is just a tool, in the
Amyrlin’s eyes. So are we. She will use us to hunt the Black Ajah, but if you break a tool so it cannot
be fixed, you don’t weep over it. You just get another one. Both of you had best remember that.”
“What are we going to do about him?” Egwene asked. “What can we do?”
Nynaeve went to her wardrobe and rummaged in the back of it. When she came out, she had a
striped cloth bag of herbs. “With my medicines—and luck—perhaps I can Heal him myself.”
“Verin could not,” Elayne said. “Moiraine and Verin together could not, and Moiraine had an
angreal. Nynaeve, if you draw too much of the One Power, you could burn yourself to a cinder. Or
just still yourself, if you are lucky. If you can call that luck.”
Nynaeve shrugged. “They keep telling me I have the potential to be the most powerful Aes Sedai
in a thousand years. Perhaps it is time to find out whether they are right.” She gave a tug to her braid.
It was plain that however brave Nynaeve’s words, she was afraid. But she won’t let Mat die
even if it means risking death herself. “They keep saying we’re all three so powerful—or will be.
Maybe, if we all try together, we can divide the flow among us.”
“We have never tried working together,” Nynaeve said slowly. “I am not sure I know how to
combine our abilities. Trying could be almost as dangerous as drawing too much of the Power.”
“Oh, if we are going to do it,” Elayne said, climbing off the bed, “let’s do it. The longer we talk
of it, the more frightened I will become. Mat is in the guest rooms. I do not know which one, but
Sheriam told me that much.”
As if to put period to her words, the door banged open, and an Aes Sedai entered as though it
were her room, and they the interlopers.
Egwene made her curtsy deep, to hide the dismay on her face.

CHAPTER

The Red Sister

Elaida was a handsome woman rather than beautiful, and the sternness on her face added
maturity to her ageless Aes Sedai features. She did not look old, yet Egwene could never imagine
Elaida as having been young. Except for the most formal occasions, few Aes Sedai wore the vineembroidered shawl with the white teardrop Flame of Tar Valon large on the wearer’s back, but
Elaida wore hers, the long red fringe announcing her Ajah. Red slashed her dress of cream-colored
silk, too, and red slippers peeked under the edge of her skirts as she moved into the room. Her dark
eyes watched them as a bird’s eyes watched worms.
“So all of you are together. Somehow, that does not surprise me.” Her voice made no more
pretense than her bearing did; she was a woman of power, and ready to wield it if she decided it was
necessary, a woman who knew more than those she spoke to. It was much the same for a queen as for
a novice.
“Forgive me, Elaida Sedai,” Nynaeve said, dropping another curtsy, “but I was about to go out. I
have much to catch up in my studies. If you will forgive—”
“Your studies can wait,” Elaida said. “They have waited long enough already, after all.” She
plucked the cloth bag out of Nynaeve’s hands and undid the strings, but after one glance inside she
tossed it on the floor. “Herbs. You are not a village Wisdom any longer, child. Trying to hold on to
the past will only hold you back.”
“Elaida Sedai,” Elayne said, “I—”
“Be silent, novice.” Elaida’s voice was cold and soft, as silk wrapped around steel is soft. “You
may have broken a bond between Tar Valon and Caemlyn that has lasted a thousand years. You will
speak when spoken to.” Elayne’s eyes examined the floor in front of her toes. Spots of color burned in
her cheeks. Guilt, or anger? Egwene was not sure.
Ignoring them all, Elaida sat down in one of the chairs, carefully arranging her skirts. She made
no gesture for the rest of them to sit. Nynaeve’s face tightened, and she began giving sharp little tugs
to her braid. Egwene hoped she would keep her temper well enough not to take the other chair
without permission.
When Elaida had settled herself to her own satisfaction, she studied them for a time in silence,
her face unreadable. At last she said, “Did you know that we have the Black Ajah among us?”
Egwene exchanged startled glances with Nynaeve and Elayne.
“We were told,” Nynaeve said cautiously. “Elaida Sedai,” she added after a pause.
Elaida arched an eyebrow. “Yes. I thought that you might know of it.” Egwene gave a start at her
tone, implying so much more than it said, and Nynaeve opened her mouth angrily, but the Aes Sedai’s
flat stare stilled tongues. “The two of you,” Elaida went on in a casual tone, “vanish, taking with you
the Daughter-Heir of Andor—the girl who may become Queen of Andor one day, if I do not strip off

her hide and sell it to a glove maker—vanish without permission, without a word, without a trace.”
“I was not carried off,” Elayne said to the floor. “I went of my own will.”
“Will you obey me, child?” A glow surrounded Elaida. The Aes Sedai’s glare was fixed on
Elayne. “Must I teach you, here and now?”
Elayne raised her head, and there was no mistaking what was in her face. Anger. For a long
moment she met Elaida’s stare.
Egwene’s fingernails dug into her palms. It was maddening. She, or Elayne, or Nynaeve, could
destroy Elaida where she sat. If they caught Elaida by surprise, at least; she was fully trained, after
all. And if we do anything but take whatever she wants to feed us, we throw away everything. Don’t
throw it away now, Elayne.
Elayne’s head dropped. “Forgive me, Elaida Sedai,” she mumbled. “I—forgot myself.”
The glow winked out of existence, and Elaida sniffed audibly. “You have learned bad habits,
wherever these two took you. You cannot afford bad habits, child. You will be the first Queen of
Andor ever to be Aes Sedai. The first queen anywhere to be Aes Sedai in over a thousand years. You
will be one of the strongest of us since the Breaking of the World, perhaps strong enough to be the
first ruler since the Breaking to openly tell the world she is Aes Sedai. Do not risk all of that, child,
because you can still lose it all. I have invested too much time to see that. Do you understand me?”
“I think so, Elaida Sedai,” Elayne said. She sounded as if she did not understand at all. No more
did Egwene.
Elaida abandoned the subject. “You may be in grave danger. All three of you. You disappear
and return, and in the interval, Liandrin and her . . . companions leave us. There will inevitably be
comparisons. We are sure Liandrin and those who went with her are Darkfriends. Black Ajah. I
would not see the same charge leveled at Elayne, and to protect her, it seems I must protect all of you.
Tell me why you ran away, and what you have been doing these months, and I will do what I can for
you.” Her eyes fastened on Egwene like grappling hooks.
Egwene floundered for an answer that the Aes Sedai would accept. It was said that Elaida could
hear a lie, sometimes. “It . . . it was Mat. He is very sick.” She tried to choose her words carefully, to
say nothing that was not true, yet give an impression far from truth. Aes Sedai do it all the time. “We
went to. . . . We brought him back to be Healed. If we hadn’t, he would die. The Amyrlin is going to
Heal him.” I hope. She made herself continue to meet the Red Aes Sedai’s gaze, willed herself not to
shift her feet guiltily. From Elaida’s face, there was no way to tell whether she believed a word.
“That is enough, Egwene,” Nynaeve said. Elaida’s penetrating look shifted to her, but she gave
no sign of being affected by it. She met the Aes Sedai’s eyes without blinking. “Forgive me for
interrupting, Elaida Sedai,” she said smoothly, “but the Amyrlin Seat said our transgressions were to
be put behind us and forgotten. As part of making a new beginning, we are not even to speak of them.
The Amyrlin said it should be as if they never happened.”
“She said that, did she?” Still nothing in Elaida’s voice or on her face told whether she believed
or not. “Interesting. You can hardly forget entirely when your punishment has been announced to the
entire Tower. Unprecedented, that. Unheard of, for less than stilling. I can see why you are eager to
put it all behind you. I understand you are to be raised to the Accepted, Elayne. And Egwene. That is
hardly punishment.”
Elayne glanced at the Aes Sedai as though for permission to speak. “The Mother said we were
ready,” she said. A touch of defiance entered her voice. “I have learned, Elaida Sedai, and grown.
She would not have named me to be raised if I had not.”
“Learned,” Elaida said musingly. “And grown. Perhaps you have.” There was no hint in her tone

whether she thought this was good. Her gaze shifted back to Egwene and Nynaeve, searching. “You
returned with this Mat, a youth from your village. There was another young man from your village.
Rand al’Thor.”
Egwene felt as if an icy hand had suddenly gripped her stomach.
“I hope he is well,” Nynaeve said levelly, but her hand was a fist gripping her braid. “We have
not seen him in some time.”
“An interesting young man.” Elaida studied them as she spoke. “I met him only once, but I found
him—most interesting. I believe he must be ta’veren. Yes. The answers to many questions may rest in
him. This Emond’s Field of yours must be an unusual place to produce the two of you. And Rand
al’Thor.”
“It is just a village,” Nynaeve said. “Just a village like any other.”
“Yes. Of course.” Elaida smiled, a cold quirk of her lips that twisted Egwene’s stomach. “Tell
me about him. The Amyrlin has not commanded you to be silent about him also, has she?”
Nynaeve gave her braid a tug. Elayne studied the carpet as if something important were hidden
in it, and Egwene racked her brain for an answer. She can hear lies, they say. Light, if she can really
hear a lie. . . . The moment stretched on, until finally Nynaeve opened her mouth.
At that instant the door opened again. Sheriam regarded the room with a measure of surprise. “It
is well I find you here, Elayne. I want all three of you. I had not expected you, Elaida.”
Elaida stood, arranging her shawl. “We are all curious about these girls. Why they ran away.
What adventures they had while gone. They say the Mother has commanded them not to speak of it.”
“As well not to,” Sheriam said. “They are to be punished, and that should be an end to it. I have
always felt that when punishment is done, the fault that caused it should be erased.”
For a long moment the two Aes Sedai stood looking at each other, no expression on either
smooth face. Then Elaida said, “Of course. Perhaps I will speak to them another time. About other
matters.” The look she gave to the three women in white seemed to Egwene to carry a warning, and
then she was slipping past Sheriam.
Holding the door open, the Mistress of Novices watched the other Aes Sedai go down the
gallery. Her face was still unreadable.
Egwene let out a long breath, and heard echoes from Nynaeve and Elayne.
“She threatened me,” Elayne said incredulously, and half to herself. “She threatened me with
stilling, if I don’t stop being—willful!”
“You mistook her,” Sheriam said. “If being willful were a stilling offense, the list of the stilled
would have more names on it than you could learn. Few meek women ever achieve the ring and the
shawl. That is not to say, of course, that you must not learn to act meekly when it is required.”
“Yes, Sheriam Sedai,” they all three said almost as one, and Sheriam smiled.
“You see? You can give the appearance of meekness, at least. And you will have plenty of
opportunity to practice before you earn your way back into the Amyrlin’s good graces. And mine.
Mine will be harder to achieve.”
“Yes, Sheriam Sedai,” Egwene said, but this time only Elayne spoke with her.
Nynaeve said, “What of . . . the body, Sheriam Sedai? The . . . the Soulless? Have you
discovered who killed him? Or why he entered the Tower?”
Sheriam’s mouth tightened. “You take one step forward, Nynaeve, and then a step back. Since
from Elayne’s lack of surprise, you have obviously told her of it—after I told you not to speak of the
matter!—then there are exactly seven people in the Tower who know a man was killed today in the
novices’ quarters, and two of them are men who know no more than that. Except that they are to keep

their mouths shut. If an order from the Mistress of Novices carries no weight with you—and if that is
so, I will correct you—perhaps you will obey one from the Amyrlin Seat. You are to speak of this to
no one except the Mother or me. The Amyrlin will not have more rumors piled on those we must
already contend with. Do I make myself clear?”
The firmness of her voice produced a chorus of “Yes, Sheriam Sedai”—but Nynaeve refused to
stop at that. “Seven, you said, Sheriam Sedai. Plus whoever killed him. And maybe they had help
getting into the Tower.”
“That is no concern of yours.” Sheriam’s level gaze included them all. “I will ask whatever
questions must be asked about this man. You will forget you know anything at all about a dead man. If
I discover you are doing anything else. . . . Well, there are worse things than scrubbing pots to occupy
your attention. And I will not accept any excuses. Do I hear any more questions?”
“No, Sheriam Sedai.” This time, Nynaeve joined in, to Egwene’s relief. Not that she felt very
much relief. Sheriam’s watchful eye would make it doubly hard to carry out a search for the Black
Ajah. For a moment she felt like laughing hysterically. If the Black Ajah doesn’t catch us, Sheriam
will. The urge to laugh vanished. If Sheriam isn’t Black Ajah herself. She wished she could make that
thought go away.
Sheriam nodded. “Very well, then. You will come with me.”
“To where?” Nynaeve asked, and added, “Sheriam Sedai,” only an instant before the Aes
Sedai’s eyes narrowed.
“Have you forgotten,” Sheriam said in a tight voice, “that in the Tower, Healing is always done
in the presence of those who bring their sick to us?”
Egwene thought that the Mistress of Novices’s stock of patience with them was about used up,
but before she could stop herself, she burst out, “Then she is going to Heal him!”
“The Amyrlin Seat herself, among others, will see to him.” Sheriam’s face held no more
expression than her voice. “Did you have reason to doubt it?” Egwene could only shake her head.
“Then you waste your friend’s life standing here. The Amyrlin Seat is not to be kept waiting.” Yet
despite her words, Egwene had the feeling the Aes Sedai was in no hurry at all.

CHAPTER

Healing

Lamps on iron wall brackets lit the passages deep beneath the Tower, where Sheriam took
them. The few doors they passed were shut tight, some locked, some so cunningly worked that they
remained unseen until Egwene was right on top of them. Dark openings marked most of the crossing
hallways, while down others she could only see the dim glow of distant lights spaced far apart. She
saw no other people. These were not places even Aes Sedai often came. The air was neither cool nor
warm, but she shivered anyway, and at the same time felt sweat trickling down her back.
It was down here, in the depths of the White Tower, that novices went through their last test
before being raised to Accepted. Or put out of the Tower, if they failed. Down here, Accepted took
the Three Oaths after passing their final test. No one, she realized, had ever told her what happened to
an Accepted who failed. Down here, somewhere, was the room where the Tower’s few angreal and
sa’angreal were kept, and the places where the ter’angreal were stored. The Black Ajah had struck
at those storerooms. And if some of the Black Ajah were lying in wait in one of those dark side
corridors, if Sheriam were leading them not to Mat, but to. . . .
She gave a squeak when the Aes Sedai stopped suddenly, then colored when the others looked at
her curiously. “I was thinking about the Black Ajah,” she said weakly.
“Do not think of it,” Sheriam said, and for once she sounded like the Sheriam of old, kindly if
firm. “The Black Ajah will not be your worry for years to come. You have what the rest of us do not:
time before you must deal with it. Much time, yet. When we enter, stay against the wall and keep
silent. You are allowed here as a benevolence, to attend, not to distract or interfere.” She opened a
door covered in gray metal worked to look like stone.
The square room within was spacious, its pale stone walls bare. The only furnishing was a long
stone table draped with a white cloth, in the middle of the room. Mat lay on that table, fully clothed
save for coat and boots, eyes closed and face so gaunt that Egwene wanted to cry. His labored
breathing made a hoarse whistle. The Shadar Logoth dagger hung sheathed at his belt, the ruby
capping its hilt seeming to gather light, so it glowed like some fierce red eye despite the illumination
of a dozen lamps, magnified by the pale walls and white-tiled floor.
The Amyrlin Seat stood at Mat’s head, and Leane at his feet. Four Aes Sedai stood down one
side of the table, and three down the other. Sheriam joined the three. One of them was Verin. Egwene
recognized Serafelle, another Brown sister, and Alanna Mosvani, of the Green Ajah, and Anaiya, of
the Blue, which was Moiraine’s Ajah.
Alanna and Anaiya had each taught her some of her lessons in opening herself to the True
Source, in how to surrender to saidar in order to control it. And between her first arrival in the White
Tower and her departure, Anaiya must have tested her fifty times to see if she was a Dreamer. The
tests had shown nothing one way or the other, but plain-faced, kindly Anaiya, with that warm smile

that was her only beauty, had kept calling her back for more tests, as implacable as a boulder rolling
downhill.
The rest were unknown to her, except for one cool-eyed woman she thought was a White. The
Amyrlin and the Keeper wore their stoles, of course, but none of the others had anything to mark them
out except Great Serpent rings and ageless Aes Sedai faces. None of them acknowledged the presence
of Egwene and the other two by so much as a glance.
Despite the outward calm of the women around the table, Egwene thought she saw signs of
uncertainty. A tightness to Anaiya’s mouth. A slight frown on Alanna’s darkly beautiful face. The
cool-eyed woman kept smoothing her pale blue dress over her thighs without seeming to realize what
she was doing.
An Aes Sedai Egwene did not know set a plain, polished wooden box, long and narrow, on the
table and opened it. From its nest in the red silk lining, the Amyrlin took out a white, fluted wand the
length of her forearm. It could have been bone, or ivory, but was neither. No one alive knew what it
was made of.
Egwene had never seen the wand before, but she recognized it from a lecture Anaiya had given
the novices. One of the few sa’angreal, and perhaps the most powerful, that the Tower possessed.
Sa’angreal had no power of their own, of course—they were merely devices for focusing and
magnifying what an Aes Sedai could channel—but with that wand, a strong Aes Sedai might be able
to crumple the walls of Tar Valon.
Egwene clutched Nynaeve’s hand on one side and Elayne’s on the other. Light! They’re not sure
they can Heal him, even with a sa’angreal—with that sa’angreal! What chance would we have had?
We’d probably have killed him, and ourselves, too. Light!
“I will meld the flows,” the Amyrlin said. “Be careful. The Power needed to break the bond
with the dagger and Heal its damage is very close to what could kill him. I will focus. Attend.” She
held the wand straight out in front of her in both hands, above Mat’s face. Still unconscious, he shook
his head and tightened a fist on the dagger’s hilt, muttering something that sounded like a denial.
A glow appeared around each Aes Sedai, that soft, white light that only a woman who could
channel could see. Slowly the lights spread, until that which seemed to emanate from one woman
touched that which came from the woman beside her, merged with it, till there was only one light, a
light that, to Egwene’s eyes, diminished the lamps to nothing. And in that brightness was a stronger
light still. A bar of bone-white fire. The sa’angreal.
Egwene fought the urge to open herself to saidar and add her flow to the tide. It was a pull so
strong she was about to be jerked off her feet. Elayne tightened her hold on her hand. Nynaeve took a
step toward the table, then stopped with an angry shake of her head. Light, Egwene thought, I could
do it. But she did not know what it was she could do. Light, it’s so strong. It’s so—wonderful.
Elayne’s hand was trembling.
On the table, Mat thrashed in the middle of the glow, jerking this way, then that, muttering
incomprehensibly. But he did not loosen his hold on the dagger, and his eyes remained closed.
Slowly, ever so slowly, he began to arch his back, muscles straining till he shook. Still he fought and
bucked, until finally only his heels and his shoulders touched the table. His hand on the dagger sprang
open and, quivering, crept back from the hilt; was forced, fighting, from the hilt. His lips skinned
away from his teeth in a snarl, a grimace of pain, and his breath came in forced grunts.
“They are killing him,” Egwene whispered. “The Amyrlin is killing him! We have to do
something.”
Just as softly, Nynaeve said, “If we stop them—if we could stop them—he’ll die. I do not think I

could handle half that much of the Power.” She paused as if she had just heard her own words—that
she could channel half of what ten full Aes Sedai did with a sa’angreal—and her voice grew even
fainter. “Light help me, I want to.”
She fell silent abruptly. Did she mean that she wanted to help Mat, or that she wanted to channel
that flow of Power? Egwene could feel that urge in herself, like a song that compelled her to dance.
“We must trust them,” Nynaeve said in an intense whisper, finally. “He has no other chance.”
Suddenly Mat shouted, loud and strong. “Muad’drin tia dar allende caba’drin rhadiem!”
Arched and struggling, eyes squeezed shut, he bellowed the words clearly. “Los Valdar Cuebiyari!
Los! Carai an Caldazar! Al Caldazar!”
Egwene frowned. She had learned enough to recognize the Old Tongue, if not to understand more
than a few words. Carai an Caldazar! Al Caldazar! “For the honor of the Red Eagle! For the Red
Eagle!” Ancient battle cries of Manetheren, a nation that had vanished during the Trolloc Wars. A
nation that had stood where the Two Rivers was now. That much, she knew; but in some way it
seemed for a moment that she should understand the rest, too, as if the meaning were just out of sight,
and all she had to do was turn her head to know.
With a loud pop of tearing leather, the golden-sheathed dagger rose from Mat’s belt, hung a foot
above his straining body. The ruby glittered, seemed to send off crimson sparks, as if it, too, fought
the Healing.
Mat’s eyes opened, and he glared at the women standing around him. “Mia ayende, Aes Sedai!
Caballein misain ye! Inde muagdhe Aes Sedai misain ye! Mia ayende!”And he began to scream, a
roar of rage that went on and on, till Egwene wondered that he had breath left in him.
Hurriedly Anaiya bent to lift a dark metal box from under the table, moving as if it were heavy.
When she set it beside Mat and opened the lid, only a small space was revealed within sides at least
two inches thick. Anaiya bent again for a set of tongs such as a goodwife might use in her kitchen, and
grasped the floating dagger in them as carefully as if it were a poisonous snake.
Mat’s scream grew frantic. The ruby shone furiously, flashing blood-red.
The Aes Sedai thrust the dagger into the box and snapped the lid down, letting out a loud sigh as
it clicked shut. “A filthy thing,” she said.
As soon as the dagger was hidden, Mat’s shriek cut off, and he collapsed as if muscle and bone
had turned to water. An instant later the glow surrounding Aes Sedai and table winked out.
“Done,” the Amyrlin said hoarsely, as if she had been the one screaming. “It is done.”
Some of the Aes Sedai sagged visibly, and sweat beaded on more than one brow. Anaiya pulled
a plain linen handkerchief from her sleeve and wiped her face openly. The cool-eyed White dabbed
almost surreptitiously at her cheeks with a bit of Lugard lace.
“Fascinating,” Verin said. “That the Old Blood could flow so strongly in anyone today.” She and
Serafelle put their heads together, talking softly, but with many gestures.
“Is he Healed?” Nynaeve said. “Will he . . . live?”
Mat lay as if sleeping, but his face still had that hollow-cheeked gauntness. Egwene had never
heard of a Healing that did not cure everything. Unless just separating him from the dagger took all
of the Power they used. Light!
“Brendas,” the Amyrlin said, “will you see that he is taken back to his room?”
“As you command, Mother,” the cool-eyed woman said, her curtsy as emotionless as she herself
seemed. When she left to summon bearers, several of the other Aes Sedai left, too, including Anaiya.
Verin and Serafelle followed, still talking to one another too quietly for Egwene to make out what
they said.

“Is Mat all right?” Nynaeve demanded. Sheriam raised her eyebrows.
The Amyrlin Seat turned toward them. “He is as well as he can be,” she said coldly. “Only time
will tell. Carrying something with Shadar Logoth’s taint for so long . . . who knows what effect it will
have on him? Perhaps none, perhaps much. We will see. But the bond with the dagger is broken. Now
he needs rest, and as much food as can be gotten into him. He should live.”
“What was that he was shouting, Mother?” Elayne asked, then hastily added, “If I may ask.”
“He was ordering soldiers.” The Amyrlin gave the young man lying on the table a quizzical look.
He had not moved since collapsing, but Egwene thought his breathing seemed easier, the rise and fall
of his chest more rhythmic. “In a battle two thousand years gone, I would say. The Old Blood comes
again.”
“It was not all about a battle,” Nynaeve said. “I heard him say Aes Sedai. That was no battle.
Mother,” she added belatedly.
For a moment the Amyrlin seemed to consider, perhaps what to say, perhaps whether to say
anything. “For a time,” she said finally, “I believe the past and the present were one. He was there,
and he was here, and he knew who we were. He commanded us to release him.” She paused again. “
‘I am a free man, Aes Sedai. I am no Aes Sedai meat.’ That is what he said.”
Leane sniffed loudly, and some of the other Aes Sedai muttered angrily under their breath.
“But, Mother,” Egwene said, “he could not have meant it as it sounds. Manetheren was allied
with Tar Valon.”
“Manetheren was an ally, child,” the Amyrlin told her, “but who can know the heart of a man?
Not even he himself, I suspect. A man is the easiest animal to put on a leash, and the hardest to keep
leashed. Even when he chooses it himself.”
“Mother,” Sheriam said, “it is late. The cooks will be waiting for these helpers.”
“Mother,” Egwene asked anxiously, “could we not stay with Mat? If he may still die. . . .”
The Amyrlin’s look was level, her face without expression. “You have chores to do, child.”
It was not scrubbing pots she meant. Egwene was sure of that. “Yes, Mother.” She curtsied, her
skirts brushing Nynaeve’s and Elayne’s as they made theirs. One last time she looked at Mat, then
followed Sheriam out. Mat had still not moved.

CHAPTER
19

Awakening

Mat opened his eyes slowly and stared up at the white plaster ceiling, wondering where he
was and how he had come there. An intricate fringe of gilded leaves bordered the ceiling, and the
mattress under his back felt plumped full of feathers. Somewhere rich, then. Somewhere with money.
But his head was empty of the where and the how, and a lot more besides.
He had been dreaming, and bits of those dreams still tumbled together with memories in his
head. He could not separate one from the other. Wild flights and fights, strange people from across the
ocean, Ways and Portal Stones and pieces of other lives, things right out of a gleeman’s tales, these
had to be dreams. At least, he thought they must be. But Loial was no dream, and he was an Ogier.
Chunks of conversations drifted around in his thoughts, talks with his father, with friends, with
Moiraine, and a beautiful woman, and a ship captain, and a well-dressed man who spoke to him like
a father giving sage advice. Those were probably real. But it was all bits and fragments. Drifting.
“Muad’drin tia dar allende caba’drin rhadiem,” he murmured. The words were only sounds,
yet they sparked—something.
The packed lines of spearmen stretched a mile or more to either side below him, dotted with
the pennants and banners of towns and cities and minor Houses. The river secured his flank on the
left, the bogs and mires on the right. From the hillside he watched the spearmen struggle against
the mass of Trollocs trying to break through, ten times the humans’ number. Spears pierced black
Trolloc mail, and spiked axes carved bloody gaps in the human ranks. Screams and bellows
harried the air. The sun burned hot overhead in a cloudless sky, and shimmers of heat rose above
the battle line. Arrows still rained down from the enemy, slaying Trolloc and human alike. He had
called his archers back, but the Dreadlords did not care so long as they broke his line. On the
ridge behind him, the Heart Guard awaited his command, horses stamping impatiently. Armor on
men and horses alike shone silver in the sunlight; neither men nor animals could stand the heat
much longer.
They must win here or die. He was known as a gambler; it was time to toss the dice. In a voice
that carried over the tumult below, he gave the order as he swung up into his saddle. “Footmen
prepare to pass cavalry forward!” His bannerman rode close beside him, the Red Eagle banner
flapping over his head, as the command was repeated up and down the line.
Below, the spearmen suddenly moved, sidestepping with good discipline, narrowing their
formations, opening wide gaps between. Gaps into which the Trollocs poured, roaring bestial
cries, like a black, oozing tide of death.
He drew his sword, raised it high. “Forward the Heart Guard!” He dug his heels in, and his
mount leaped down the slope. Behind him, hooves thundered in the charge. “Forward!” He was
first to strike into the Trollocs, his sword rising and falling, his bannerman close behind. “For the

honor of the Red Eagle!” The Heart Guard pounded into the gaps between the spearmen, smashing
the tide, hurling it back. “The Red Eagle!” Half-human faces snarled at him, oddly curved swords
sought him, but he cut his way ever deeper. Win or die. “Manetheren!”
Mat’s hand trembled as he raised it to his forehead. “Los Valdar Cuebiyari,” he muttered. He
was almost sure he knew what it meant—“Forward the Heart Guard,” or maybe “The Heart Guard
will advance”—but that could not be. Moiraine had told him a few words of the Old Tongue, and
those were all he knew of it. The rest might as well be magpie chatter.
“Crazy,” he said roughly. “It probably isn’t even the Old Tongue at all. Just gibberish. That Aes
Sedai is crazy. It was only a dream.”
Aes Sedai. Moiraine. He suddenly became aware of his too-thin wrist and bony hand, and
looked at them. He had been sick. Something to do with a dagger. A dagger with a ruby in the hilt, and
a long-dead, tainted city called Shadar Logoth. It was all foggy and distant, and made no real sense,
but he knew it was no dream. Egwene and Nynaeve had been taking him to Tar Valon to be Healed.
He remembered that much.
He tried to sit up, and fell back, as weak as a newborn lamb. Laboriously, he pulled himself up
and shoved the single woolen blanket aside. His clothes were gone, perhaps into the vine-carved
wardrobe standing against the wall. For the moment he did not care about clothes. He struggled to his
feet, tottered across the flowered carpet to cling to a high-backed armchair, and lurched from the
chair to the table, gilded scrolls on its legs and edges.
Beeswax candles, four to each tall stand and small mirrors behind the flames, lit the room
brightly. A larger mirror on the wall above the highly polished washstand threw his reflection back at
him, gaunt and wasted, cheeks hollow and dark eyes sunken, hair sweat-matted, bent like an old man
and wavering like pasture grass in a breeze. He made himself stand straight, but it was not much
improvement.
A large, covered tray sat on the table in front of his hands, and his nose caught the smells of
food. He twitched aside the cloth, revealing two large silver pitchers and dishes of thin green
porcelain. He had heard that the Sea Folk charged its weight in silver for that porcelain. He had
expected beef tea, or sweetbreads, the kinds of things invalids had pushed on them. Instead, one plate
held slices of a beef roast piled thickly, with brown mustard and horseradish. On others there were
roasted potatoes, sweetbeans with onions, cabbage, and butterpeas. Pickles, and a wedge of yellow
cheese. Thick slices of crusty bread, and a dish of butter. One pitcher was filled with milk and still
beaded with condensation on the outside, the other with what smelled like spiced wine. There was
enough of everything for four men. His mouth watered, and his stomach growled at him.
First I find out where I am. But he rolled up a slice of beef and dipped it in the mustard before
pushing himself away from the table toward the three tall, narrow windows.
Wooden shutters carved in lacy patterns covered them, but through the holes he could see that it
was night outside. Lights from other windows made dots in the blackness. For a moment he sagged
against the white stone windowsill in frustration, but then he began to think.
You can turn the worst that comes to your advantage if you only think, his father always said, and
certainly Abell Cauthon was the best horse trader in the Two Rivers. When it seemed somebody had
taken advantage of Mat’s father, it always turned out they had gotten the greasy end of the stick. Not
that Abell Cauthon ever did anything dishonest, but even Taren Ferry folk never got the best of him,
and everybody knew how close to the bone they cut. All because he thought about things from every
side that there was.
Tar Valon. It had to be Tar Valon. This room belonged in a palace. The flowered Domani carpet

alone probably cost as much as a farm. More, he did not think he was sick any longer, and from what
he had been told, Tar Valon was his only chance to get well. He had never actually felt sick, not that
he remembered, not even when Verin—another name swam out of the haze—had told someone nearby
that he was dying. Now he felt weak as a babe and hungry as a starving wolf, but somehow, he was
sure the Healing had been done. I feel—whole and well, that’s all. I’ve been Healed. He grimaced at
the shutters.
Healed. That meant they had used the One Power on him. The notion sent goose bumps marching
across his skin, but he had known it would be done. “Better than dying,” he told himself. Some of the
stories he had heard about Aes Sedai came back. “It has to be better than dying. Even Nynaeve
thought I was going to die. Anyway, it’s done, and worrying about it now won’t help anything.” He
realized he had finished the slice of beef and was licking its juice from his fingers.
Unsteadily, he made his way back to the table. There was a stool underneath. He pulled it out
and sat down. Not bothering with knife or fork, he made another roll of beef. How could he turn being
in Tar Valon—In the White Tower. It has to be—to his advantage?
Tar Valon meant Aes Sedai. That was certainly no reason to stay even an hour. Exactly the
opposite. What he remembered of his time with Moiraine, and later with Verin, was not much to go
on. He could not recall either of them doing anything really terrible, but then he could not recall a
great deal of that time at all. Anyway, whatever Aes Sedai did, they did for their own reasons.
“And those aren’t always the reasons you think they are,” he mumbled around a mouthful of
potato, then swallowed. “An Aes Sedai never lies, but the truth an Aes Sedai tells you isn’t always
the truth you think it is. That’s one thing I have to remember: I can’t be sure about them even when I
think I know.” It was not a cheering conclusion. He filled his mouth with butterpeas.
Thinking about Aes Sedai made him remember a little about them. The seven Ajahs: Blue, Red,
Brown, Green, Yellow, White, and Gray. The Reds were the worst. Except for that Black Ajah they
all claim doesn’t exist. But the Red Ajah should be no threat to him. They were only interested in
men who could channel.
Rand. Burn me, how could I forget that? Where is he? Is he all right? He sighed regretfully,
and spread butter on a piece of still-warm bread. I wonder if he’s gone mad yet.
Even if he knew the answers, he could do nothing to help Rand. He was not sure he would if he
could. Rand could channel, and Mat had grown up with stories of men channeling, stories to frighten
children. Stories that frightened adults, too, because some of them were all too true. Discovering what
Rand could do had been like finding out his best friend tortured small animals and killed babies.
Once you finally made yourself believe it, it was hard to call him a friend any longer.
“I have to look out for myself,” he said angrily. He upended the wine pitcher over his silver cup
and was surprised to find it empty. He filled the cup with milk, instead. “Egwene and Nynaeve want
to be Aes Sedai.” He had not really remembered that until he said it aloud. “Rand is following
Moiraine around and calling himself the Dragon Reborn. The Light knows what Perrin is up to. He’s
been acting crazy ever since his eyes turned funny. I have to look out for myself.” Burn me, I have to!
I’m the last one of us who’s still sane. There’s only me.
Tar Valon. Well, it was supposed to be the wealthiest city in the world, and it was the center of
trade between the Borderlands and the south, the center of Aes Sedai power. He did not think he
could get an Aes Sedai to gamble with him. Or trust the fall of the dice or the turn of the cards if he
did. But there had to be merchants, and others with silver and gold. The city itself would be worth a
few days. He knew he had traveled far since leaving the Two Rivers, but aside from a few vague
memories of Caemlyn and Cairhien, he could remember nothing of any great cities. He had always

wanted to see a great city.
“But not one full of Aes Sedai,” he muttered sourly, scraping up the last of the butterpeas. He
gulped them down and went back for another helping of beef.
Idly, he wondered if the Aes Sedai might let him have the ruby from the Shadar Logoth dagger.
He remembered the dagger in only the fuzziest way, but even that was like remembering a terrible
injury. His insides knotted up, and sharp pain dug at his temples. Yet the ruby was clear in his mind,
as big as his thumbnail, dark as a drop of blood, glittering like some crimson eye. Surely he had more
claim to it than they did, and it had to be worth as much as a dozen farms back home.
They’ll probably say it is tainted, too. And likely it was. Still he spun a little fancy of trading
the ruby to some of the Coplins for their best land. Most of that family—troublemakers from the
cradle, where they were not thieves and liars as well—deserved whatever happened to them and
more. But he really did not believe the Aes Sedai would give it back to him, did not relish the notion
of carrying it as far as Emond’s Field if they did. And the thought of owning the largest farm in the
Two Rivers was no longer as exciting as it once had been. Once that had been his biggest ambition,
that, and to be known as his father’s equal as a horse trader. Now it seemed such a small thing to
want. A cramped thing, with the whole wide world just waiting out there.
First off, he decided, he would find Egwene and Nynaeve. Maybe they’ve come to their senses.
Maybe they’ve given up this foolishness about becoming Aes Sedai. He did not think they would
have, but he could not go without seeing them. He would go; that was sure. A visit with them, a day to
see the city, perhaps a game with the dice to pad out his purse, and then he would be off for
somewhere where there were no Aes Sedai. Before he returned home—I will go home one day. One
day, I will—he meant to see something of the world, and without any Aes Sedai making him dance to
her tune.
Rummaging around the tray for something more to eat, he was shocked to realize nothing was left
but smears and a few crumbs of bread and cheese. The pitchers were both empty. He squinted down
at his stomach in wonder. He should have been stuffed to the ears with all that in him, but he felt as if
he had hardly eaten at all. He scraped the last bits of cheese together between thumb and forefinger.
Halfway to his mouth, his hand froze.
I blew the Horn of Valere. Softly he whistled a bit of tune, then cut it short when the words
came to him:
I’m down at the bottom of the well.
It’s night, and the rain is coming down.
The sides are falling in,
and there’s no rope to climb.
I’m down at the bottom of the well.
“There had better be a bloody rope to climb,” he whispered. He let the cheese crumbs fall on the
tray. For the moment he felt sick again. Determinedly he tried to think, tried to penetrate the fog that
shrouded everything in his head.
Verin had been bringing the Horn to Tar Valon, but he could not remember if she knew he was
the one who had blown it. She had never said anything to make him think so. He was sure of that. He
thought he was. So what if she does know? What if they all do? Unless Verin did something with it I
don’t know about, they have the Horn. They don’t need me. But who could say what Aes Sedai
thought they needed?
“If they ask,” he said grimly, “I never even touched it. If they know. . . . If they know, I’ll . . . I’ll

handle that when it comes. Burn me, they can’t want anything from me. They can’t!”
A soft knock on the door brought him swaying to his feet, ready to run. If there had been any
place to run to, and if he could have managed more than three steps. But there was not, and he could
not.
The door opened.

CHAPTER

Visitations

The woman who came in, dressed all in white silk and silver, shut the door behind her and
leaned back against it to study him with the darkest eyes Mat had ever seen. She was so beautiful he
almost forgot to breathe, with hair as black as night held by a finely woven silver band, and as
graceful in repose as another woman would be dancing. He halfway thought that he knew her, but he
rejected the idea out of hand. No man could ever forget a woman like her.
“You may be passable, I suppose, once you fill out again,” she said, “but for now, perhaps you
could put on something.”
For an instant Mat continued to stare at her; then suddenly he realized he was standing there
naked. Face scarlet, he shambled to the bed, pulled the blanket around himself like a cloak, and more
fell than sat down on the edge of the mattress. “I’m sorry for . . . I mean, I . . . that is, I didn’t expect
. . . I . . . I . . .” He drew a deep breath. “I apologize for your finding me this way.”
He could still feel the heat in his cheeks. For a moment he wished that Rand, whatever he had
become, or even Perrin were there to advise him. They always seemed to get on well with women.
Even girls who knew that Rand was all but promised to Egwene used to stare at him, and they seemed
to think Perrin’s slow ways were gentle and attractive. However hard he tried, he always managed to
make a fool of himself in front of girls. As he had just done.
“I would not have visited you in this way, Mat, except that I was here in the . . . in the White
Tower—” She smiled as if the name amused her—“for another purpose, and I wanted to see all of
you.” Mat’s face reddened again, and he tugged the blanket around him tighter, but she seemed not to
have been teasing him. More graceful than a swan, she glided to the table. “You are hungry. That’s to
be expected, the way they do things. Make sure you eat all they give you. You will be surprised at
how quickly you put weight back and regain strength.”
“Pardon,” Mat said diffidently, “but do I know you? Meaning no offense, but you seem . . .
familiar.” She looked at him until he began to shift uneasily. A woman like her would expect to be
remembered.
“You may have seen me,” she said finally. “Somewhere. Call me Selene.” Her head tilted
slightly; she appeared to be waiting for him to recognize the name.
It tugged at the edges of memory. He thought he must have heard it before, but he could not say
when or where. “Are you an Aes Sedai, Selene?”
“No.” The word was soft but surprisingly emphatic.
For the first time, he studied her, able now to see more than her beauty. She was almost as tall as
he was, slender and, he suspected from the way she moved, strong. He was not sure of her age—a
year or two older than he, or maybe as much as ten—but her cheeks were smooth. Her necklace of
smooth white stones and woven silver matched her wide belt, but she did not wear a Great Serpent

ring. The absence should not have surprised him—no Aes Sedai would ever say right out that she was
not—yet it did. There was an air about her—a self-confidence, a surety in her own power to match
any queen’s, and something more—that he associated with Aes Sedai.
“You aren’t by any chance a novice, are you?” He had heard that novices wore white, but he
could not really believe it of her. She makes Elayne look like a cringer. Elayne. Another name
drifting into his head.
“Hardly that,” Selene said with a wry twist to her mouth. “Let us just say that I am someone
whose interests coincide with yours. These . . . Aes Sedai mean to use you, but you will like it, in the
main, I think. And accept it. There is no need to convince you to seek out glory.”
“Use me?” The memory returned to him of thinking that, but about Rand, that the Aes Sedai
meant to use Rand, not him. They’ve no bloody use for me. Light, they can’t have! “What do you
mean? I’m no one important. I am no use to anyone but myself. What kind of glory?”
“I knew that would pull you. You, above all.”
Her smile made his head spin. He scrubbed a hand through his hair. The blanket slipped, and he
caught it hastily before it could fall. “Now listen, they are not interested in me.” What about me
sounding the Horn? “I am just a farmer.” Maybe they think I’m tied to Rand in some way. No, Verin
said. . . . He was not sure what Verin had said, or Moiraine, but he thought most Aes Sedai knew
nothing at all about Rand. He wanted to keep it that way, at least until he was a long way gone. “Just a
simple country man. I only want to see a little of the world and go back to my da’s farm.” What does
she mean, glory?
Selene shook her head as if she had heard his thoughts. “You are more important than you yet
know. Certainly more important than these so-called Aes Sedai know. You can have glory, if you
know enough not to trust them.”
“You certainly sound as if you don’t trust them.” So-called? A thought came to him, but he could
not manage to say it. “Are you a . . . ? Are you . . . ?” It was not the kind of thing you accused
someone of.
“A Darkfriend?” Selene said mockingly. She sounded amused, not angered. She sounded
contemptuous. “One of those pathetic followers of Ba’alzamon who think he will give them
immortality and power? I follow no one. There is one man I could stand beside, but I do not follow.”
Mat laughed nervously. “Of course not.” Blood and ashes, a Darkfriend wouldn’t name herself
Darkfriend. Probably has a poisoned knife, if she is. He had a vague memory of a woman dressed as
one nobly born, a Darkfriend with a deadly dagger in her slender hand. “That wasn’t what I meant at
all. You look. . . . You look like a queen. That’s what I meant. Are you a Lady?”
“Mat, Mat, you must learn to trust me. Oh, I will use you, too—you have too suspicious a nature,
especially since carrying that dagger, for me to deny it—but my use will gain you wealth, and power,
and glory. I will not compel you. I have always believed men perform better if convinced rather than
forced. These Aes Sedai do not even realize how important you are, and he will try to dissuade or
kill you, but I can give you what you desire.”
“He?” Mat said sharply. Kill me? Light, it’s Rand they were after, not me. How does she know
about the dagger? I suppose the whole Tower knows. “Who wants to kill me?”
Selene’s mouth tightened as if she had said too much. “You know what you want, Mat, and I
know it every bit as well as you. You must choose who you will trust to gain it for you. I admit I will
use you. These Aes Sedai will never do that. I will lead you to wealth and glory. They will keep you
tied to a leash until you die.”
“You say a lot,” Mat said, “but how do I know any of it is true? How do I know I can trust you

any more than I can them?”
“By listening to what they tell you, and what they do not. Will they tell you your father came to
Tar Valon?”
“My da was here?”
“A man named Abell Cauthon, and another named Tam al’Thor. They made nuisances of
themselves until they gained an audience, I have heard, wanting to know where you and your friends
were. And Siuan Sanche sent them back to the Two Rivers with empty hands, not even letting them
know you were alive. Will they tell you that, unless you ask? Perhaps not even then, for you might try
to run away back home.”
“My da thinks I am dead?” Mat said slowly.
“He can be told you live. I can see to it. Think on who to trust, Mat Cauthon. Will they tell you
that even now Rand al’Thor is trying to escape, and the one called Moiraine is hunting him? Will they
tell you that the Black Ajah infests their precious White Tower? Will they even tell you how they
mean to use you?”
“Rand is trying to escape? But—” Maybe she knew Rand had proclaimed himself the Dragon
Reborn, and maybe she did not, but he would not tell her. The Black Ajah! Blood and bloody ashes!
“Who are you, Selene? If you’re not Aes Sedai, what are you?”
Her smile hid secrets. “Just remember that there is another choice. You need not be a puppet for
the White Tower or prey for Ba’alzamon’s Darkfriends. The world is more complex than you can
imagine. Do as these Aes Sedai wish for the present, but remember your choices. Will you do that?”
“I don’t see that I have much choice at all,” he said glumly. “I suppose I will.”
Selene’s look sharpened. Friendliness sloughed off her voice like an old snake skin. “Suppose? I
did not come to you like this, talk in this way, for suppose, Matrim Cauthon.” She stretched out a slim
hand.
Her hand was empty, and she stood halfway across the room, but he leaned back, away from her
hand, as if she were right on top of him with a dagger. He did not know why, really, except that there
was a threat in her eyes, and he was sure it was real. His skin began to tingle, and his headache
returned.
Suddenly tingle and pain vanished together, and Selene’s head whipped around as if listening to
something beyond the walls. A tiny frown appeared on her face, and she lowered her hand. The frown
vanished. “We will talk again, Mat. I have much to say to you. Remember your choices. Remember
that there are many hands that would kill you. I alone guarantee you life, and all you seek, if you do as
I say.” She slipped out of the door as silently and gracefully as she had entered.
Mat let out a long breath. Sweat ran down his face. Who in the Light is she? A Darkfriend,
perhaps. Except that she had sounded as contemptuous of Ba’alzamon as she was of Aes Sedai.
Darkfriends spoke of Ba’alzamon the way anyone else might speak of the Creator. And she had not
asked him to conceal her visit from the Aes Sedai.
Right, he thought sourly. Pardon me, Aes Sedai, but this woman came to see me. She wasn’t
Aes Sedai, but I think maybe she started to use the One Power on me, and she said she wasn’t a
Darkfriend, but she did say you mean to use me, and the Black Ajah’s in your Tower. Oh, and she
said I’m important. I don’t know how. You don’t mind if I leave now, do you?
Going was beginning to be a better idea by the minute. He slid awkwardly off the bed and made
his way unsteadily to the wardrobe, still clutching his blanket around him. His boots were on the floor
inside, and his cloak hung from a peg, under his belt, with pouch and sheathed belt knife. It was just a
country knife, with a stout blade, but it could do as much as any fine dagger. The rest of his clothes—

two sturdy wool coats, three pairs of breeches, half a dozen linen shirts and smallclothes—had been
brushed or washed as required, and neatly folded on the shelves that took up one side of the
wardrobe. He felt the pouch hanging from the belt, but it was empty. Its contents lay jumbled on a
shelf with what had been emptied from his pockets.
He brushed aside a redhawk’s feather, a smooth, striped rock he had liked the colors of, his
razor, and his bone-handled pocketknife, and freed his wash-leather purse from some coils of spare
bowstring. When he tugged it open, he found his memory had been all too good in this instance.
“Two silver marks and a handful of copper,” he muttered. “I won’t get far on that.” Once it
would have seemed a small fortune to him, but that had been before he left Emond’s Field.
He stooped to peer back into the shelf. Where are they? He began to be afraid the Aes Sedai
might have thrown them out, the way his mother would if she had ever found them. Where . . . ? He
felt a surge of relief. Way in the back, behind his tinderbox and ball of twine for snares and the like,
were his two leather dice cups.
They rattled as he pulled them out, but he still popped off the tight-fitting round caps. Everything
was as it should be. Five dice carved with symbols, for crowns, and five marked with spots. The
spotted dice would do for a number of games, but more men seemed to play crowns than anything
else. With these, his two marks would become enough to take him far away from Tar Valon. Away
from Aes Sedai and Selene, both.
A peremptory knock was followed immediately by the door opening. He whirled around. The
Amyrlin Seat and the Keeper of the Chronicles were entering. He would have recognized them even
without the Amyrlin’s broad, striped stole, and the Keeper’s narrower blue stole. He had seen them
once and only once, a long way from Tar Valon, but he could not forget the two most powerful
women among the Aes Sedai.
The Amyrlin’s eyebrows rose at the sight of him standing there with the blanket hanging from his
shoulders and his purse and dice cups in his hands. “I don’t think you will need those for a while yet,
my son,” she said dryly. “Put them up and get back to bed before you fall on your face.”
He hesitated, his back stiffening, but his knees chose that moment to wobble, and the two Aes
Sedai were looking at him, dark eyes and blue alike appearing to read his every rebellious thought.
He did as he was told, holding the blanket around him with both hands. He lay down straight as a
board, not sure what else he could do.
“How are you feeling?” the Amyrlin asked briskly as she put a hand on his head. Goose bumps
covered his skin. Had she done something with the One Power, or was it being touched by an Aes
Sedai that made him feel a chill?
“I’m fine,” he told her. “Why, I am ready to be on my way. Just let me say goodbye to Egwene
and Nynaeve, and I’ll be out of your hair. I mean, I will go . . . uh, Mother.” Moiraine and Verin had
not seemed to care much how he talked, but this was the Amyrlin Seat, after all.
“Nonsense,” the Amyrlin said. She pulled the high-backed chair around, closer to the bed, and
sat, addressing Leane. “Men always seem to refuse to admit they are sick until they’re sick enough to
make twice as much work for women. Then they claim they’re well too soon, with the same result.”
The Keeper glanced at Mat and nodded. “Yes, Mother, yet this one cannot claim he is well when
he can barely stand up. At least he has eaten everything on his tray.”
“I’d be surprised if he had left enough crumbs to interest a finch. And still hungry, unless I miss
my guess.”
“I could have someone bring him a pie, Mother. Or some cakes.”
“No, I think he has had as much as he can hold for now. If he brings it all back up, it won’t do

him any good.”
Mat scowled. It seemed to him that when you got sick, you became invisible to women unless
they were actually talking to you. And then they took at least ten years off your age. Nynaeve, his
mother, his sisters, the Amyrlin Seat, they all did it.
“I’m not hungry at all,” he announced. “I am fine. If you will let me put my clothes on, I’ll show
you how well I am. I will be out of here before you know it.” They were both looking at him, now. He
cleared his throat. “Uh . . . Mother.”
The Amyrlin snorted. “You’ve eaten a meal for five, and you will eat three or four like it every
day for days yet, or else you will starve to death. You’ve just been Healed from a link to the evil that
killed every man, woman, and child in Aridhol, and no less strong for near two thousand years
waiting for you to pick it up. It was killing you just as surely as it killed them. That is not like having
a fish spine stuck in your thumb, boy. We very nearly killed you ourselves trying to save you.”
“I am not hungry,” he maintained. His stomach growled loudly to give him the lie.
“I read you aright the first time I saw you,” the Amyrlin said. “I knew right then you’d bolt like a
startled fisher-bird if you ever thought someone was trying to hold you. As well I took precautions.”
He eyed them warily. “Precautions?” They looked back, all serenity. He felt as if their eyes
were pinning him to the bed.
“Your name and description are on their way to the bridge guards,” the Amyrlin said, “and the
dockmasters. I’ll not try to hold you inside the Tower, but you will not leave Tar Valon until you are
well. Should you try to hide in the city, hunger will drive you back here eventually, or if it doesn’t,
we will find you before you starve.”
“Why do you want to keep me here so badly?” he demanded. He heard Selene’s voice. They
want to use you. “Why should you care whether I starve or not? I can feed myself.”
The Amyrlin gave a small laugh with little amusement in it. “With two silver marks and a
handful of copper, my son? Your dice would need to be very lucky indeed to buy all the food you’ll
need in the next few days. We do not Heal people, then let them waste our efforts by dying while they
still need care. In addition to which, you may yet need more Healing.”
“More? You said you had Healed me. Why should I need more?”
“My son, you carried that dagger for months. I believe we dug every trace of it out of you, but if
we missed even the smallest speck, it could still be fatal. And who knows what effect your having it
in your possession so long may have? Half a year from now, a year, and you may wish you had an
Aes Sedai to hand to Heal you again.”
“You want me to stay here a year?” he said incredulously, and loudly. Leane shifted her feet and
eyed him sharply, but the Amyrlin’s calm features were unruffled.
“Perhaps not so long as that, my son. Long enough to be certain, though. Surely you want as
much. Would you set sail in a boat when you didn’t know whether the caulking would hold, or
whether a plank might be rotten?”
“I never had much to do with boats,” Mat muttered. It might be true. Aes Sedai never lied, but
there were too many mights and mays in it for him. “I’ve been gone from home a long time, Mother.
My da and my mother probably think I am dead.”
“If you wish to write a letter to them, I will see that it is carried to Emond’s Field.”
Mat waited for more, but no more came. “Thank you, Mother.” He essayed a small laugh. “I’m
half surprised my da did not come looking for me. He’s the kind of man who would.” He was not
sure, but he thought there was a small hesitation before the Amyrlin answered.
“He did come. Leane spoke to him.”

The Keeper took it up immediately. “We did not know where you were then, Mat. I told him so,
and he left before the heavy snows. I gave him some gold to make the journey home easier.”
“No doubt,” the Amyrlin said, “he will be pleased to hear from you. And your mother will,
certainly. Give me the letter when you have written it, and I will see to it.”
They had told him, but he had had to ask. And they didn’t mention Rand’s da. Maybe because
they didn’t think I would care, and maybe because. . . . Burn me, I don’t know. Who can tell with
Aes Sedai? “I was traveling with a friend, Mother. Rand al’Thor. You remember him. Do you know if
he is all right? I’ll bet his da is worried, too.”
“As far as I know,” the Amyrlin said smoothly, “the boy is well enough, but who can say? I have
seen him only once, the time I saw you, in Fal Dara.” She turned to the Keeper. “Perhaps he could do
with a small piece of pie, Leane. And something for his throat, if he is going to do all this talking.
Will you see that it is brought to him?”
The tall Aes Sedai left with a murmured, “As you command, Mother.”
When the Amyrlin turned back to Mat, she was smiling, but her eyes were blue ice. “There are
things it would be dangerous for you to talk about, perhaps even in front of Leane. A flapping tongue
has killed more men than sudden storms ever did.”
“Dangerous, Mother?” His mouth felt suddenly parched, but he resisted the urge to lick his lips.
Light, how much does she know about Rand? If only Moiraine didn’t keep so many secrets.
“Mother, I don’t know anything dangerous. I can hardly remember half of what I do know.”
“Do you remember the Horn?”
“What horn is that, Mother?”
She was on her feet and looming over him so fast he hardly saw her move. “You play games
with me, boy, and I will make you weep for your mother to come running. I have no time for games,
and neither do you. Now, do—you—remember?”
Clutching the blanket tightly around him, he had to swallow before he could say, “I remember,
Mother.”
She seemed to relax, just a little, and Mat shrugged his shoulders queasily. He felt as if he had
just been allowed to lift them off a chopping block.
“Good. That is good, Mat.” She sat back down slowly, studying him. “Do you know that you are
linked to the Horn?” He mouthed the word “linked” silently, shocked, and she nodded. “I did not think
you knew. You were first to blow the Horn of Valere after it was found. For you, it will summon dead
heroes back from the grave. For anyone else, it is only a horn—so long as you live.”
He took a deep breath. “So long as I live,” he said in a dull voice, and the Amyrlin nodded.
“You could have let me die.” She nodded again. “Then you could have had anyone you want blow it,
and it would have worked for them.” Another nod. “Blood and ashes! You mean me to blow it for
you. When the Last Battle comes, you mean me to call heroes back from the grave to fight the Dark
One for you. Blood and bloody ashes!”
She put an elbow on the arm of the chair and propped her chin on her hand. Her eyes never left
him. “Would you prefer the alternative?”
He frowned, then remembered what the alternative was. If someone else had to sound the Horn.
. . . “You want me to blow the Horn? Then I’ll blow the Horn. I never said I would not, did I?”
The Amyrlin gave an exasperated sigh. “You remind me of my uncle Huan. No one could ever
pin him down. He liked to gamble, too, and he’d much rather have fun than work. He died pulling
children out of a burning house. He wouldn’t stop going back as long as there was one left inside. Are
you like him, Mat? Will you be there when the flames are high?”

He could not meet her eyes. He studied his fingers as they plucked irritably at his blanket. “I’m
no hero. I do what I have to do, but I am no hero.”
“Most of those we call heroes only did what they had to do. I suppose it will have to be enough.
For now. You must not speak to anyone but me of the Horn, my son. Or of your link to it.”
For now? he thought. It’s all you are going to bloody get, now or ever. “I don’t mean to bloody
tell everybo—” She arched an eyebrow, and he made his voice smooth again. “I do not want to tell
anyone. I wish nobody knew. Why do you want to keep it such a secret? Don’t you trust your Aes
Sedai?”
For a long moment he thought he had gone too far. Her face hardened, and her look could have
carved axe handles.
“If I could make it so that only you and I knew,” she said coldly, “I would. The more people
know a thing, the more the knowledge spreads, even with the best will. Most of the world believes
the Horn of Valere is only legend, and those who know better believe one of the Hunters has yet to
find it. But Shayol Ghul knows it has been found, and that means at least some Darkfriends know.
But they do not know where it is, and, if the Light shines on us, they do not know you sounded it.
Do you really want Darkfriends coming after you? Halfmen, or other Shadowspawn? They want the
Horn. You must know that. It will work as well for the Shadow as for the Light. But if it is to work
for them, they must take you, or kill you. Do you want to risk that?”
Mat wished he had another blanket, and maybe a goose-down comforter. The room suddenly felt
very cold. “Are you telling me Darkfriends could come after me here? I thought the White Tower
could keep Darkfriends out.” He remembered what Selene had said about the Black Ajah, and
wondered what the Amyrlin would say to that.
“A good reason to stay, wouldn’t you say?” She got to her feet, smoothing her skirts. “Rest, my
son. Soon you will feel much better. Rest.” She closed the door softly behind her.
For a long time Mat lay staring up at the ceiling. He barely noticed when a serving woman came
with his piece of pie and another pitcher of milk, taking the tray of empty dishes when she went. His
stomach rumbled loudly at the warm smell of apples and spices, but he paid that no mind, either. The
Amyrlin thought she held him like a sheep in a pen. And Selene. . . . Who in the Light is she? What
does she want? Selene had been right about some things; but the Amyrlin had told him she meant to
use him, and how. In a way. There were too many holes in what she had said to suit him, too many
holes she could slip something deadly through. The Amyrlin wanted something, and Selene wanted
something, and he was the rope they were tugging between them. He thought he would rather face
Trollocs than be caught between those two.
There had to be a way out of Tar Valon, a way out of both their grasps. Once he was beyond the
river, he could keep out of Aes Sedai hands, and Selene’s, and Darkfriends’, too. He was sure of it.
There had to be a way. All he had to do was think about it from every angle.
The pie grew cold on the table.

CHAPTER

A World of Dreams

Egwene scrubbed her hands with a hand towel as she hurried down the dimly lit corridor. She
had washed them twice, but they still felt greasy. She had not thought there could be so many pots in
the world. And today had been bake day, so buckets of ashes had had to be hauled from the ovens.
And the hearths cleaned. And the tables rubbed bone-white with fine sand, and the floors scrubbed on
hands and knees. Ash and grease stained her white dress. Her back ached, and she wanted to be in her
bed, but Verin had come to the kitchens, supposedly for a meal to eat in her rooms, and whispered a
summons to her in passing.
Verin had her quarters above the library, in corridors used only by a few other Brown sisters.
There was a dusty air to the halls there, as if the women who lived along them were too busy with
other things to bother having the servants clean very often, and the passages took odd turns and twists,
sometimes dipping or rising unexpectedly. The tapestries were few, their colorful weavings dulled,
apparently cleaned as seldom as everything else here. Many of the lamps were unlit, plunging much of
the hall into gloom. Egwene thought she had it to herself, except for a flash of white ahead, perhaps a
novice or a servant scurrying about some task. Her shoes, clicking on bare black and white floor tiles,
made echoes. It was not a comforting place for one thinking of the Black Ajah.
She found what Verin had told her to look for. A dark paneled door at the top of a rise, beside a
dusty tapestry of a king on horse back receiving the surrender of another king. Verin had named the
pair of them—men dead hundreds of years before Artur Hawkwing was born; Verin always seemed
to know such things—but Egwene could not remember their names, or the long-vanished countries
they had ruled. It was the only wall hanging she had seen that matched Verin’s description, though.
Minus the sound of her own footsteps, the hallway seemed even emptier than before, and more
threatening. She rapped on the door, and entered hurriedly on the heels of an absentminded “Who is
it? Come in.”
One step into the room, she stopped and stared. Shelves lined the walls, except for one door that
must lead to inner rooms and except for where maps hung, often in layers, and what seemed to be
charts of the night sky. She recognized the names of some constellations—the Plowman and the
Haywain, the Archer and the Five Sisters—but others were unfamiliar. Books and papers and scrolls
covered nearly every flat surface, with all sorts of odd things interspersed among the piles, and
sometimes on top of them. Strange shapes of glass or metal, spheres and tubes interlinked, and circles
held inside circles, stood among bones and skulls of every shape and description. What appeared to
be a stuffed brown owl, not much bigger than Egwene’s hand, stood on what seemed to be a bleached
white lizard’s skull, but could not be, for the skull was longer than her arm and had crooked teeth as
big as her fingers. Candlesticks had been stuck about in a haphazard fashion, giving good light here
and shadows there, although seeming in danger of setting fire to papers in some places. The owl

blinked at her, and she jumped.
“Ah, yes,” Verin said. She was seated behind a table as cluttered as everything else in the room,
a torn page held carefully in her hands. “It is you. Yes.” She noticed Egwene’s sideways glance at the
owl, and said absently, “He keeps down mice. They chew paper.” Her gesture took in the entire
room, and reminded her of the page she held. “Fascinating, this. Rosel of Essam claimed more than a
hundred pages survived the Breaking, and she should have known, since she wrote barely two
hundred years afterwards, but only this one piece still exists, so far as I know. Perhaps only this very
copy. Rosel wrote that it held secrets the world could not face, and she would not speak of them
plainly. I have read this page a thousand times, trying to decipher what she meant.”
The tiny owl blinked at Egwene again. She tried not to look at it. “What does it say, Verin
Sedai?”
Verin blinked, very much as the owl had. “What does it say? It is a direct translation, mind, and
reads almost like a bard reciting in High Chant. Listen. ‘Heart of the Dark. Ba’alzamon. Name hidden
within name shrouded by name. Secret buried within secret cloaked by secret. Betrayer of Hope.
Ishamael betrays all hope. Truth burns and sears. Hope fails before truth. A lie is our shield. Who can
stand against the Heart of the Dark? Who can face the Betrayer of Hope? Soul of shadow, Soul of the
Shadow, he is—’ ” She stopped with a sigh. “It ends there. What do you make of it?”
“I don’t know,” Egwene said. “I do not like it.”
“Well, why should you, child? Like it, or understand it? I have studied it nearly forty years, and I
do neither.” Verin carefully placed the page inside a silk-lined folder of stiff leather, then casually
stuffed the folder into a stack of papers. “But you did not come for that.” She rummaged across the
table, muttering to herself, several times barely catching a pile of books or manuscripts before it
toppled. Finally she came up with a handful of pages covered in a thin, spidery hand and tied with
nubby string. “Here, child. Everything that is known about Liandrin and the women who went with
her. Names, ages, Ajahs, where they were born. Everything I could find in the records. Even how they
performed in their studies. What we know of the ter’angreal they took, too, which isn’t much. Only
descriptions, for the most part. I do not know whether any of this will help. I saw nothing of any use
in this.”
“Perhaps one of us will see something.” A sudden wave of suspicion took Egwene by surprise.
If she didn’t leave something out. The Amyrlin seemed to trust Verin only because she had to. What
if Verin was Black Ajah herself? She gave herself a shake. She had traveled all the way from Toman
Head to Tar Valon with Verin, and she refused to believe this plump scholar could be a Darkfriend.
“I trust you, Verin Sedai.” Can I, really?
The Aes Sedai blinked at her again, then dismissed whatever thought had come to her with a
shake of her head. “That list I gave you may be important, or it may be so much waste of paper, but it
isn’t the only reason I summoned you.” She started moving things on the table, making some shaky
stacks taller to clear a space. “I understand from Anaiya that you might become a Dreamer. The last
was Corianin Nedeal, four hundred and seventy-three years ago, and from what I can make of the
records, she barely deserved the name. It would be quite interesting, if you do.”
“She tested me, Verin Sedai, but she couldn’t be sure that any of my dreams foretold the future.”
“That is only part of what a Dreamer does, child. Perhaps the least part. Anaiya believes in
bringing girls along too slowly, in my opinion. Look here.” With one finger, Verin drew a number of
parallel lines across the area she had cleared, lines clear in dust atop the old beeswax. “Let these
represent worlds that might exist if different choices had been made, if major turning points in the
Pattern had gone another way.”

“The worlds reached by the Portal Stones,” Egwene said, to show she had listened to Verin’s
lectures on the journey from Toman Head. What could this possibly have to do with whether or not
she was a Dreamer?
“Very good. But the Pattern may be even more complex than that, child. The Wheel weaves our
lives to make the Pattern of an Age, but the Ages themselves are woven into the Age Lace, the Great
Pattern. Who can know if this is even the tenth part of the weaving, though? Some in the Age of
Legends apparently believe that there were still other worlds—even harder to reach than the worlds
of the Portal Stones, if that can be believed—lying like this.” She drew more lines, cross-hatching the
first set. For a moment she stared at them. “The warp and the woof of the weave. Perhaps the Wheel
of Time weaves a still greater Pattern from worlds.” Straightening, she dusted her hands. “Well, that
is neither here nor there. In all of these worlds, whatever their other variations, a few things are
constant. One is that the Dark One is imprisoned in all of them.”
In spite of herself, Egwene stepped closer to peer at the lines Verin had drawn. “In all of them?
How can that be? Are you saying there is a Father of Lies for each world?” The thought of so many
Dark Ones made her shiver.
“No, child. There is one Creator, who exists everywhere at once for all of these worlds. In the
same way, there is only one Dark One, who also exists in all of these worlds at once. If he is freed
from the prison the Creator made in one world, he is freed on all. So long as he is kept prisoner in
one, he remains imprisoned on all.”
“That does not seem to make sense,” Egwene protested.
“Paradox, child. The Dark One is the embodiment of paradox and chaos, the destroyer of reason
and logic, the breaker of balance, the un-maker of order.”
The owl suddenly took flight on silent wings, landing atop a large white skull on a shelf behind
the Aes Sedai. It peered down at the two women, blinking. Egwene had noticed the skull when she
came in, with its curled horns and snout, and vaguely wondered what sort of ram had so big a head.
Now she took in the roundness of it, the high forehead. Not a ram’s skull. A Trolloc.
She drew a shuddering breath. “Verin Sedai, what does this have to do with being a Dreamer?
The Dark One is bound in Shayol Ghul, and I do not want to even think of him escaping.”But the
seals on his prison are weakening. Even novices know that, now.
“Do with being a Dreamer? Why, nothing, child. Except that we must all confront the Dark One
in one way or another. He is prisoned now, but the Pattern did not bring Rand al’Thor into the world
for no purpose. The Dragon Reborn will face the Lord of the Grave; that much is sure. If Rand
survives that long, of course. The Dark One will try to distort the Pattern, if he can. Well, we have
gone rather far afield, haven’t we?”
“Forgive me, Verin Sedai, but if this”—Egwene indicated the lines drawn in the dust—“has
nothing to do with being a Dreamer, why are you telling me about it?”
Verin stared at her as if she were deliberately being dense. “Nothing? Of course it has something
to do with it, child. The point is that there is a third constant besides the Creator and the Dark One.
There is a world that lies within each of these others, inside all of them at the same time. Or perhaps
surrounding them. Writers in the Age of Legends called it Tel’aran’rhiod, “the Unseen World.”
Perhaps “the World of Dreams” is a better translation. Many people—ordinary folk who could not
think of channeling—sometimes glimpse Tel’aran’rhiod in their dreams, and even catch glimmers of
these other worlds through it. Think of some of the peculiar things you have seen in your dreams. But
a Dreamer, child—a true Dreamer—can enter Tel’aran’rhiod.”
Egwene tried to swallow, but a lump in her throat stopped her. Enter it? “I . . . I don’t think I am

a Dreamer, Verin Sedai. Anaiya Sedai’s tests—”
Verin cut her off. “—prove nothing one way or the other. And Anaiya still believes that you may
very well be one.”
“I suppose I will learn whether I am or not eventually,” Egwene mumbled. Light, I want to be,
don’t I? I want to learn! I want it all.
“You have no time to wait, child. The Amyrlin has entrusted a great task to you and Nynaeve.
You must reach out for any tool you might be able to use.” Verin dug a red wooden box from under
the welter on her table. The box was large enough to hold sheets of paper, but when the Aes Sedai
opened the lid a crack, all she pulled out was a ring carved from stone, all flecks and stripes of blue
and brown and red, and too large to be a finger ring. “Here, child.”
Egwene shifted the papers to take it, and her eyes widened in surprise. The ring certainly looked
like stone, but it felt harder than steel and heavier than lead. And the circle of it was twisted. If she
ran a finger along one edge, it would go around twice, inside as well as out; it only had one edge. She
moved her finger along that edge twice, just to convince herself.
“Corianin Nedeal,” Verin said, “had that ter’angreal in her possession for most of her life. You
will keep it, now.”
Egwene almost dropped the ring. A ter’angreal? I am to keep a ter’angreal?
Verin seemed not to notice her shock. “According to her, it eases the passage to Tel’aran’rhiod.
She claimed it would work for those without Talent as well as for Aes Sedai, so long as you are
touching it when you sleep. There are dangers, of course. Tel’aran’rhiod is not like other dreams.
What happens there is real; you are actually there instead of just glimpsing it.” She pushed back the
sleeve of her dress, revealing a faded scar the length of her forearm. “I tried it myself, once, some
years ago. Anaiya’s Healing did not work as well as it should have. Remember that.” The Aes Sedai
let her sleeve cover the scar again.
“I will be careful, Verin Sedai.” Real? My dreams are bad enough as they are. I want no
dreams that leave scars! I’ll put it in a sack and stick it in a dark corner and leave it there. I’ll—
But she wanted to learn. She wanted to be Aes Sedai, and no Aes Sedai had been a Dreamer in nearly
five hundred years. “I’ll be very careful.” She slipped the ring into her pouch and tugged the
drawstrings tight, then picked up the papers Verin had given her.
“Remember to keep it hidden, child. No novice, or even an Accepted, should have a thing like
that in her possession. But it may prove useful to you. Keep it hidden.”
“Yes, Verin Sedai.” Remembering Verin’s scar, she almost wished another Aes Sedai would
come along and take it from her right then.
“Good, child. Now, off with you. It grows late, and you must be up early to help with breakfast.
Sleep well.”
Verin sat looking at the door for a time after it closed behind Egwene. The owl hooted softly
behind her. Pulling the red box to her, she opened the lid all the way and frowned at what nearly
filled the space.
Page upon page, covered with a precise hand, the black ink barely faded after nearly five
hundred years. Corianin Nedeal’s notes, everything she had learned in fifty years of studying that
peculiar ter’angreal. A secretive woman, Corianin. She had kept by far the greater part of her
knowledge from everyone, trusting it only to these pages. Only chance and a habit of rummaging
through old papers in the library had led Verin to them. As far as she could discover, no Aes Sedai
besides herself knew of the ter’angreal; Corianin had managed to erase its existence from the

records.
Once again she considered burning the manuscript, just as she had considered giving it to
Egwene. But destroying knowledge, any knowledge, was anathema to her. And for the other. . . . No.
It is best by far to leave things as they are. What will happen, will happen. She let the lid drop shut.
Now where did I put that page?
Frowning, she began to search the stacks of books and papers for the leather folder. Egwene was
already out of her mind.

CHAPTER
22

The Price of the Ring

Egwene had only gone a short distance from Verin’s rooms when Sheriam met her. The
Mistress of Novices wore a preoccupied frown.
“If someone hadn’t remembered Verin speaking to you, I might not have found you.” The Aes
Sedai sounded mildly irritated. “Come along, child. You are holding everything up! What are those
papers?”
Egwene clutched them a little tighter. She tried to make her voice both meek and respectful.
“Verin Sedai thinks I should study them, Aes Sedai.” What would she do if Sheriam asked to see
them? What excuse could she give for refusing, what explanation for pages telling all about thirteen
women of the Black Ajah and the ter’angreal they had stolen?
But Sheriam seemed to have dismissed the papers from her mind as soon as she asked. “Never
mind that. You are wanted, and everyone is waiting.” She took Egwene’s arm and forced her to walk
faster.
“Wanted, Sheriam Sedai? Waiting for what?”
Sheriam shook her head with exasperation. “Did you forget that you are to be raised to the
Accepted? When you come to my study tomorrow, you will be wearing the ring, though I doubt it will
soothe you very much.”
Egwene tried to stop short, but the Aes Sedai hurried her on, taking a narrow set of stairs that
curled down through the library walls. “Tonight? Already? But I am half-asleep, Aes Sedai, and
dirty, and. . . . I thought I would have days yet. To get ready. To prepare.”
“The hour waits on no woman,” Sheriam said. “The Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills,when the
Wheel wills. Besides, how would you prepare? You already know the things you must. More than
your friend Nynaeve did.” She pushed Egwene through a tiny door at the foot of the stairs and hurried
her across another hall to a ramp curving down and down.
“I listened to the lectures,” Egwene protested, “and I remember them, but . . . can’t I have a
night’s sleep first?” The winding ramp seemed to have no end.
“The Amyrlin Seat decided there was no point in waiting.” Sheriam gave Egwene a sidelong
smile. “Her exact words were, ‘Once you decide to gut a fish, there’s no use waiting till it rots.’
Elayne has already been through the arches by this time, and the Amyrlin means you to go through
tonight as well. Not that I can see the point of such a hurry,” she added, half to herself, “but when the
Amyrlin commands, we obey.”
Egwene let herself be pulled down the ramp in silence, a knot forming in her belly. Nynaeve had
been far from forthcoming about what had happened when she was raised to the Accepted. She would
not speak of it at all, except for a grimaced ‘I hate Aes Sedai!’ Egwene was trembling by the time the
ramp finally ended at a broad hallway, far below the Tower in the rock of the island.

The hall was plain and undecorated, the pale rock through which it had been hewn smoothed but
left otherwise untouched, and there was only one set of dark wooden doors, as tall and wide as
fortress gates and as plain, although of smoothly finished and finely fitted planks, at the very end.
Those great doors were so well balanced, though, that Sheriam easily pushed one open, and pulled
Egwene through after her, into a great, domed chamber.
“Not before time!” Elaida snapped. She stood to one side in her red-fringed shawl, beside a
table on which sat three large silver chalices.
Lamps on tall stands illumined the chamber, and what sat centered under the dome. Three
rounded, silver arches, just tall enough to walk under, sitting on a thick silver ring with their ends
touching where they joined it. An Aes Sedai sat cross-legged on the bare rock before each of the
spots where arches joined ring, all three wearing their shawls. Alanna was the sister of the Green
Ajah, but she did not know the Yellow sister, or the White.
Surrounded by the glow of saidar embraced, the three Aes Sedai stared fixedly at the arches,
and within the silver structure an answering glow flickered and grew. That structure was a
ter’angreal, and whatever it had been made for in the Age of Legends, now novices passed through it
to become Accepted. Inside it, Egwene would have to face her fears. Three times. The white light
within the arches no longer flickered; it stayed within them as if confined, but it filled the space, made
it opaque.
“Be easy, Elaida,” Sheriam said calmly. “We will be done soon.” She turned to Egwene.
“Novices are given three chances at this. You may refuse twice to enter, but at the third refusal, you
are sent away from the Tower forever. That is how it is done usually, and you certainly have the right
to refuse, but I do not think the Amyrlin Seat will be pleased with you if you do.”
“She should not be given this chance.” There was iron in Elaida’s voice, and her face was
scarcely softer. “I do not care what her potential is. She should be put out of the Tower. Or failing
that, set to scrubbing floors for the next ten years.”
Sheriam gave the Red sister a sharp look. “You were not so adamant about Elayne. You
demanded to be part of this, Elaida—perhaps because of Elayne—and you will do your part for this
girl as well, as you are supposed to, or you will leave and I will find another.”
The two Aes Sedai stared at one another until Egwene would not have been surprised to see the
glow of the One Power surround them. Finally Elaida gave a toss of her head and sniffed loudly.
“If it must be done, let us do it. Give the miserable girl her chance to refuse and be done with it.
It is late.”
“I won’t refuse.” Egwene’s voice quavered, but she steadied it and held her head high. “I want
to go on.”
“Good,” Sheriam said. “Good. Now I will tell you two things no woman hears until she stands
where you do. Once you begin, you must go on to the end. Refuse at any point, and you will be put out
of the Tower just as if you had refused to begin for the third time. Second. To seek, to strive, is to
know danger.” She sounded as if she had said this many times. There was a light of sympathy in her
eyes, but her face was almost as stern as Elaida’s. The sympathy frightened Egwene more than the
sternness. “Some women have entered, and never come out. When the ter’angreal was allowed to
grow quiet, they—were—not—there. And they were never seen again. If you will survive, you must
be steadfast. Falter, fail, and. . . .”Sheriam’s face drove the unspoken words home; Egwene shivered.
“This is your last chance. Refuse now, and it counts only as the first. You may still try twice more. If
you accept now, there is no turning back. It is no shame to refuse. I could not do it, my first time.
Choose.”

They never came out? Egwene swallowed hard. I want to be Aes Sedai. And first I have to
become Accepted. “I accept.”
Sheriam nodded. “Then ready yourself.”
Egwene blinked, then remembered. She had to enter unclothed. She bent to set down the tied
bundle of papers Verin had given her—and hesitated. If she left them there, Sheriam or Elaida either
one could go through them while she was inside the ter’angreal. They could find that smaller
ter’angreal in her pouch. If she refused to go on, she could hide them away, perhaps leave them with
Nynaeve. Her breath caught. I cannot refuse now. I’ve already begun.
“Have you already chosen to refuse, child?” Sheriam asked, frowning. “Knowing what that will
mean, now?”
“No, Aes Sedai,” Egwene said quickly. Hastily she undressed and folded her clothes, then set
them on top of the pouch and the papers. It would have to do.
Beside the ter’angreal, Alanna suddenly spoke. “There is some sort of—resonance.” She never
took her eyes from the arches. “An echo, almost. I do not know from where.”
“Is there a problem?” Sheriam asked sharply. She sounded surprised, too. “I will not send a
woman in there if there is any problem.”
Egwene looked yearningly at her piled clothes. Please, yes, Light, a problem. Something that
will let me hide those papers without refusing to enter.
“No,” Alanna said. “It is like having a biteme buzz ’round your head when you’re trying to think,
but it does not interfere. I would not have mentioned it, only it has never happened before that I ever
heard.” She shook her head. “It is gone now.”
“Perhaps,” Elaida said dryly, “others thought such a small thing was not worth mentioning.”
“Let us go on.” Sheriam’s tone would not put up with any more distractions. “Come.”
With a last glance at her clothes and the hidden papers, Egwene followed her toward the arches.
The stone felt like ice under her bare feet.
“Whom do you bring with you, Sister?” Elaida intoned.
Continuing her measured pace, Sheriam replied, “One who comes as a candidate for
Acceptance, Sister.” The three Aes Sedai around the ter’angreal did not move.
“Is she ready?”
“She is ready to leave behind what she was, and, passing through her fears, gain Acceptance.”
“Does she know her fears?”
“She has never faced them, but now is willing.”
“Then let her face what she fears.” Even in its formality, there was a note of satisfaction in
Elaida’s voice.
“The first time,” Sheriam said, “is for what was. The way back will come but once. Be
steadfast.”
Egwene took a deep breath and stepped forward, through the arch and into the glow. Light
swallowed her whole.
“Jaim Dawtry dropped by. There’s odd news down from Baerlon with the peddler.”
Egwene raised her head from the cradle she was rocking. Rand was standing in the doorway.
For an instant her head spun. She looked from Rand—my husband—to the child in the cradle—my
daughter—and back again, in wonder.
The way back will come but once. Be steadfast.
It was not her own thought, but a disembodied voice that could have been inside her head or out,

male or female, yet emotionless and unknowable. Somehow, it did not seem strange to her.
The moment of wonder passed, and the only thing to wonder about was why she had thought
anything seemed out of round. Of course Rand was her husband—her handsome, loving husband—and
Joiya was her daughter—the most beautiful, sweetest little girl in the Two Rivers. Tam, Rand’s
father, was out with the sheep, supposedly so Rand could work on the barn but really so he could
have more time to play with Joiya. This afternoon Egwene’s mother and father would come out from
the village. And probably Nynaeve, to see if motherhood was interfering with Egwene’s studies to
replace Nynaeve as Wisdom one day.
“What kind of news?” she asked. She took up rocking the cradle again, and Rand came over to
grin down at the tiny child wrapped in swaddling clothes. Egwene laughed softly to herself. He was
so taken with his daughter that he did not hear what people said to him half the time. “Rand? What
kind of news? Rand?”
“What?” His grin faded. “Strange news. War. There’s some big war, taking up most of the
world, so Jaim claims.” That was strange news; word of wars seldom reached the Two Rivers till the
wars were long done. “He says everybody is fighting some folk called the Shawkin, or the Sanchan,
or something like that. I never heard of them.”
Egwene knew—she thought she knew—Whatever it was, was gone.
“Are you all right?” he asked. “It’s nothing to upset us here, my heart. Wars never touch the Two
Rivers. We are too far from everywhere for anyone to care.”
“I’m not upset. Did Jaim say anything else?”
“Nothing you can believe. He sounded like a Coplin. He said the peddler told him these people
use Aes Sedai in battle, but then he claimed they offer a thousand gold marks to anyone who turns an
Aes Sedai over to them. And they kill anybody who hides one. It makes no sense. Well, it’s nothing to
trouble us. It is all a long way from here.”
Aes Sedai. Egwene touched her head. The way back comes but once. Be steadfast.
She noticed Rand had a hand to his own head. “The headaches?” she asked.
He nodded, his eyes suddenly tight. “That powder Nynaeve gave me doesn’t seem to be working
the last few days.”
She hesitated. These headaches of his worried her. They grew worse every time they came, now.
And worst of all was something she had not noticed at first, something she almost wished she never
had noticed. When Rand’s head hurt, strange things happened soon after. Lightning out of a clear sky,
smashing to bits that huge oak stump he had been working two days to root out where he and Tam
were clearing new field. Storms that Nynaeve did not hear coming when she listened to the wind.
Wildfires in the forest. And the deeper his pain grew, the worse what followed. No one else had
connected these things to Rand, not even Nynaeve, and Egwene was grateful for that. She did not want
to think about what it might mean.
That is plain stupid foolish, she told herself. I must know if I am going to help him. Because
she had a secret of her own, one that frightened her even as she tried to puzzle out what it meant.
Nynaeve was teaching her the herbs, teaching Egwene to follow her as Wisdom, one day. Nynaeve’s
cures often worked in near miraculous fashion, wounds healed with barely a scar, sick folk brought
back from the edge of the grave. But three times now, Egwene had cured someone Nynaeve had given
up for dead. Three times she had sat to hold a hand through the last hour, and seen the person get up
from a deathbed. Nynaeve had questioned her closely on what she had done, what herbs she had used,
in what blending. Thus far, she had not found the courage to admit that she had done nothing. I must
have done something. Once might be chance, but three times. . . . I have to figure it out. I have to

learn. That set off a buzz in her head, as though the words were echoing inside her skull. If I could do
something for them, I can help my husband.
“Let me try, Rand,” she said. And as she stood, through the open door, she saw a silver arch
standing in front of the house, an arch filled with white light. The way back will come but once. Be
steadfast. She took two steps toward the door before she could stop herself.
She halted, looked back at Joiya gurgling in her cradle, at Rand still pressing hand to his head
and looking at her as if wondering where she was going. “No,” she said. “No, this is what I want.
This is what I want! Why can’t I have this, too?” She did not understand her own words. Of course,
this was what she wanted, and she had it.
“What is it you want, Egwene?” Rand asked. “If it’s anything I can get, you know I will. If I can’t
get it, I’ll make it.”
The way back will come but once. Be steadfast.
She took another step, into the doorway. The silver arch beckoned her. Something waited on the
other side. Something she wanted more than anything else in the world. Something she had to do.
“Egwene, I—”
There was a thump behind her. She looked over her shoulder to see Rand on his knees, bowed
and head cradled in his hands. The pain had never hit him so hard. What will come after this?
“Ah, Light!” he panted. “Light! Hurts! Light, it hurts worse than ever! Egwene?”
Be steadfast.
It was waiting. Something she had to do. Had to. She took a step. It was hard, harder than
anything she had ever done in her life. Outside, toward the arch. Behind her, Joiya was laughing.
“Egwene? Egwene, I can’t—” He cut off with a loud groan.
Steadfast.
She stiffened her back and kept walking, but she could not keep the tears from rolling down her
cheeks. Rand’s groans built to a scream, drowning Joiya’s laughter. From the corner of her eye,
Egwene saw Tam coming, running as hard as he could.
He can’t help, she thought, and tears became wracking sobs. There is nothing he can do. But I
could. I could.
She stepped into the light, and was consumed.
Trembling and sobbing, Egwene stepped out of the arch, the same by which she had entered,
memory cascading back with Sheriam’s face confronting her. Cold clear water washed away her
tears as Elaida slowly emptied a silver chalice over her head. Her weeping went on; she did not think
it would ever end.
“You are washed clean,” Elaida pronounced, “of what sin you may have done, and of those done
against you. You are washed clean of what crime you may have committed, and of those committed
against you. You come to us washed clean and pure, in heart and soul.”
Light, Egwene thought as the water ran down her body, let it be so. Can water wash away what
I did? “Her name was Joiya,” she told Sheriam between sobs. “Joiya. Nothing can be worth what I
just . . . what I. . . .”
“There is a price to become Aes Sedai,” Sheriam replied, but the sympathy was back in her
eyes, stronger than before. “There is always a price.”
“Was it real? Did I dream it?” Weeping swallowed what she wanted to say. Did I leave him to
die? Did I leave my baby?
Sheriam put an arm around her shoulders, began guiding her around the circle of arches. “Every

woman I have ever watched come out of there has asked that question. The answer is, no one knows.
It has been speculated that perhaps some of those who do not come back chose to stay because they
found a happier place, and lived out their lives there.” Her voice hardened. “If it is real, and they
stayed from choice, then I hope the lives they live are far from happy. I have no sympathy for any who
run from their responsibilities.” The edge on her tone softened slightly. “Myself, I believe it is not
real. But the danger is. Remember that.” She stopped in front of the next glow-filled arch. “Are you
ready?”
Shifting her feet, Egwene nodded, and Sheriam took her arm away.
“The second time is for what is. The way back will come but once. Be steadfast.”
Egwene trembled. Whatever happens, it cannot be worse than the last. It cannot be. She
stepped into the glow.
She stared down at her dress, blue silk sewn with pearls, all dusty and torn. Her head came up,
and she took in the ruins of a great palace around her. The Royal Palace of Andor, in Caemlyn. She
knew that, and wanted to scream.
The way back will come but once. Be steadfast.
The world was not the way she wanted it, no way that she could think of without wanting to cry,
but all her tears had been cried away long ago, and the world was as it was. Ruin was what she
expected to see.
Careless of making more rips in her dress but as careful of sound as a mouse, she climbed one of
the piles of rubble and peered into the curving streets of the Inner City. As far as she could see in
every direction lay ruin and desolation, buildings that looked as if they had been torn apart by
madmen, thick plumes of smoke rising from the fires still burning. There were people in the streets,
bands of armed men prowling, searching. And Trollocs. The men shied away from the Trollocs, and
the Trollocs snarled at them and laughed, harsh guttural laughter. But they knew each other, worked
together.
A Myrddraal came striding down the street, its black cloak swaying gently with its steps even
when the wind gusted to drive dust and rubbish past it. Men and Trollocs alike cowered under its
eyeless stare. “Hunt!” Its voice sounded like something long dead crumbling. “Do not stand there
shivering! Find him!”
Egwene slipped back down the pile of jumbled stones as silently as she could.
The way back will come but once. Be steadfast.
She stopped, afraid the whisper had come from Shadowspawn. In some way, though, she was
sure it had not. Glancing back over her shoulder, half fearful of seeing the Myrddraal standing where
she had just been, she hurried onward and into the ruined palace, climbing over fallen timbers,
squeezing between heavy blocks of collapsed masonry as she made her way. Once she stepped on a
woman’s arm, sticking out from under a mound of plaster and bricks that had been an interior wall
and perhaps part of the floor above. She noticed the arm as little as she noticed the Great Serpent ring
on one finger. She had trained herself not to see the dead buried in the refuse heap Trollocs and
Darkfriends had made of Caemlyn. She could do nothing for the dead.
Forcing her way through a narrow gap where part of the ceiling had fallen, she found herself in a
room half buried under what had stood above it. Rand lay with a heavy beam pinning him across the
waist, his legs hidden beneath the stone blocks that filled half the room. Dust and sweat coated his
face. He opened his eyes when she came near him.
“You came back.” He forced the words out in a hoarse rasp. “I was afraid—No matter. You

have to help me.”
She sank wearily to the floor. “I could lift that beam easily with Air, but as soon as it moves,
everything else will come down on top of you. On top of both of us. I cannot manage all of it, Rand.”
His laugh was bitter and painful, and cut off almost as soon as it began. Fresh sweat glistened on
his face, and he spoke with an effort. “I could shift the beam myself. You know that. I could shift that
and the stones above, all of them. But I have to let go of myself to do it, and I can’t trust that. I cannot
trust—” He stopped, wheezing for breath.
“I do not understand,” she said slowly. “Let go of yourself? What can’t you trust?” The way back
will come but once. Be steadfast. She rubbed her hands roughly over her ears.
“The madness, Egwene. I am—actually—holding it—at bay.” His gasping laugh made her skin
prickle. “But it takes everything I have just to do that. If I let go, even a little, even for an instant, the
madness will have me. I won’t care what I do then. You have to help me.”
“How, Rand! I’ve tried everything I know. Tell me how, and I will do it.”
His hand flopped out, fell just short of a dagger lying in the dust bare-bladed. “The dagger,” he
whispered. His hand made a painful journey back to his chest. “Here. In the heart. Kill me.”
She stared at him, at the dagger, as if they were both poisonous serpents. “No! Rand, I will not. I
cannot! How could you ask such a thing?”
Slowly his hand crept back toward the dagger. His fingers came short again. He strained,
moaning, brushed it with a fingertip. Before he could try again, she kicked it away from him. He
collapsed with a sob.
“Tell me why,” she demanded. “Why would you ask me to—to murder you? I will Heal you, I
will do anything to get you out of there, but I cannot kill you. Why?”
“They can turn me, Egwene.” His breathing was so tortured, she wished she could weep. “If they
take me—the Myrddraal—the Dreadlords—they can turn me to the Shadow. If madness has me, I
cannot fight them. I won’t know what they are doing till it is too late. If there is even a spark of life
left when they find me, they can still do it. Please, Egwene. For the love of the Light. Kill me.”
“I—I can’t, Rand. Light help me, I cannot!”
The way back will come but once. Be steadfast.
She looked over her shoulder, and a silver arch filled with white light took up most of the open
space among the rubble.
“Egwene, help me.”
Be steadfast.
She stood and took a step toward the arch. It was right there in front of her. One more step, and.
...
“Please, Egwene. Help me. I can’t reach it. For the love of the Light, Egwene, help me!”
“I cannot kill you,” she whispered.
“I can’t. Forgive me.” She stepped forward.
“HELP ME, EGWENE!”
Light burned her to ash.
Staggering, she stepped out of the arch, neither noticing her nakedness nor caring. A shudder ran
through her, and she covered her mouth with both hands. “I couldn’t, Rand,” she whispered. “I
couldn’t. Please forgive me.” Light help him. Please, Light help Rand.
Cold water poured over her head.
“You are washed clean of false pride,” Elaida intoned. “You are washed clean of false

ambition. You come to us washed clean, in heart and soul.”
As the Red sister turned away, Sheriam gently took Egwene’s shoulders and guided her toward
the last arch. “One more, child. One more, and it is done.”
“He said they could turn him to the Shadow,” Egwene mumbled. “He said the Myrddraal and the
Dreadlords could force him.”
Sheriam missed a step, and looked around quickly. Elaida was almost back to the table. The Aes
Sedai surrounding the ter’angreal stared at it, seeming lost to anything else. “An unpleasant thing to
talk of, child,” Sheriam said finally, and softly. “Come. One more.”
“Can they?” Egwene insisted.
“Custom,” Sheriam said, “is not to speak of what happens within the ter’angreal. A woman’s
fears are her own.”
“Can they?”
Sheriam sighed, glanced at the other Aes Sedai again, then dropped her voice to a whisper and
spoke swiftly. “This is something known only to a few, child, even in the Tower. You should not
learn it now, if ever, but I will tell you. There is—a weakness in being able to channel. That we learn
to open ourselves to the True Source means that we can be—opened to other things.” Egwene
shuddered. “Calm yourself, child. It is not so easily done. It is a thing not done, so far as I know—
Light send it has not been done!—since the Trolloc Wars. It took thirteen Dreadlords—Darkfriends
who could channel—weaving the flows through thirteen Myrddraal. You see? Not easily done. There
are no Dreadlords today. This is a secret of the Tower, child. If others knew, we could never
convince them they were safe. Only one who can channel can be turned in this way. The weakness of
our strength. Everyone else is as safe as a fortress; only their own deeds and will can turn them to the
Shadow.”
“Thirteen,” Egwene said in a tiny voice. “The same number who left the Tower. Liandrin, and
twelve more.”
Sheriam’s face hardened. “That is nothing for you to dwell on. You will forget it.” Her voice
climbed to a normal volume. “The third time is for what will be. The way back will come but once.
Be steadfast.”
Egwene stared at the glowing arch, stared at some far distance beyond it. Liandrin and twelve
others. Thirteen Darkfriends who can channel. Light help us all. She stepped into the light. It filled
her. It shone through her. It burned her to the bone, seared her to the soul. She flashed incandescent in
the light. Light help me! There was nothing but the light. And the pain.
Egwene stared into the standing mirror, and was not sure whether she was more surprised by the
ageless smoothness of her face or the striped stole that hung around her neck. The stole of the Amyrlin
Seat.
The way back will come but once. Be steadfast.
Thirteen.
She swayed, caught at the mirror and almost toppled it and herself to the blue-tiled floor of her
dressing chamber. Something is wrong, she thought. The wrongness had nothing to do with her
sudden dizziness, or at least that was not what felt wrong. It was something else. But she had no idea
what.
There was an Aes Sedai at her elbow, a woman with Sheriam’s high cheekbones but dark hair
and concerned brown eyes, and the hand-wide stole of the Keeper on her shoulders. Not Sheriam,
though. Egwene had never seen her before; she was sure she knew her as well as she knew herself.

Haltingly, she put a name to the woman. Beldeine.
“Are you ill, Mother?”
Her stole is green. That means she was raised from the Green Ajah. The Keeper always comes
from the same Ajah as the Amyrlin she serves. Which means if I’m the Amyrlin—if?—then I was
Green Ajah, too. That thought shook her. Not that she had been Green Ajah, but that she had to reason
it out. Light, something is wrong with me.
The way back will come bu. . . . The voice in her head trailed away to finish in a buzz.
Thirteen Darkfriends.
“I am well, Beldeine,” Egwene said. The name felt strange on her tongue; it felt as if she had
been saying it for years. “We mustn’t keep them waiting.” Keep who waiting? She did not know,
except that she felt infinitely sad about ending that wait, endlessly reluctant.
“They will be growing impatient, Mother.” There was a hesitation in Beldeine’s voice, as if she
felt the same reluctance as Egwene, but for a different reason. Unless Egwene missed her guess,
behind that outer calm, Beldeine was terrified.
“In that case, we had best be about it.”
Beldeine nodded, then took a deep breath before crossing the carpet to where her staff of office,
topped with the snowdrop White Flame of Tar Valon, stood propped beside the door. “I suppose we
must, Mother.” She took up the staff and opened the door for Egwene, then hurried ahead so that they
made a procession of two, Keeper of the Chronicles leading the Amyrlin Seat.
Egwene noticed little of the corridors they took. All her attention was directed inward. What is
the matter with me? Why can’t I remember? Why is so much of what I . . . almost remember
wrong? She touched the seven-striped stole on her shoulders. Why am I half sure I’m still a novice?
The way back will come but on—This time it ended abruptly.
Thirteen of the Black Ajah.
She stumbled at that. It was a frightening thought, but it chilled her to the marrow beyond fear. It
felt—personal. She wanted to scream, to run and hide. She felt as if they were after her. Nonsense.
The Black Ajah has been destroyed. That seemed an odd thought, too. Part of her remembered
something called the Great Purge. Part of her was sure no such thing had happened.
Eyes fixed ahead, Beldeine had not noticed her stumble. Egwene had to lengthen her stride to
catch up. This woman is scared to her toenails. What in the Light is she taking me to?
Beldeine stopped before tall, paired doors, their dark wood each inlaid with a large silver
Flame of Tar Valon. She wiped her hands on her dress, as if they were suddenly sweaty, before
opening one door and leading Egwene up a straight ramp of the same silver-streaked white stone that
made Tar Valon’s walls. Even here it seemed to shine.
The ramp let into a large, circular room under a domed ceiling at least thirty paces high. A
raised platform ran around the outer edge of the room, fronted by steps except where this ramp and
two others came out, spaced equally around the circle. The Flame of Tar Valon lay centered in the
floor, surrounded by widening spirals of color, the colors of the seven Ajahs. At the opposite side of
the room from where the ramp entered, a high-backed chair stood, heavy and ornately carved in vines
and leaves, painted in the colors of all the Ajahs.
Beldeine rapped her staff sharply on the floor. There was a tremor in her voice. “She comes.
The Watcher of the Seals. The Flame of Tar Valon. The Amyrlin Seat. She comes.”
With a rustle of skirts, shawled women on the platform got up from their chairs. Twenty-one
chairs in groupings of three, each triad painted and cushioned in the same color as the fringe on the
shawls of the women who stood before them.

The Hall of the Tower, Egwene thought as she crossed the floor to her chair. The Amyrlin Seat’s
chair. That’s all it is. The Hall of the Tower, and the Sitters for the Ajahs. I’ve been here thousands
of times. But she could not remember one of them. What am I doing in the Hall of the Tower? Light,
they’ll skin me alive when they see. . . . She was not sure what it was they would see, only that she
prayed they did not.
The way back will come but—
The way back will—
The way—
The Black Ajah waits. That, at least, was whole. It came from everywhere. Why did no one else
seem to hear it?
Settling in the chair of the Amyrlin Seat—the chair that was also the Amyrlin Seat—she realized
she had no idea what to do next. The other Aes Sedai had seated themselves when she did, all but
Beldeine, who stood beside her with the staff, swallowing nervously. They all seemed to be waiting
on her.
“Begin,” she said finally.
It seemed to be enough. One of the Red Sitters stood. Egwene was shocked to recognize Elaida.
At the same time she knew that Elaida was foremost of the Sitters for the Red, and her own bitterest
enemy. The look on Elaida’s face as she stared across the chamber made Egwene shiver inside. It
was stern and cold—and triumphant. It promised things best not thought of.
“Bring him in,” Elaida said loudly.
From one of the ramps—not the one Egwene had entered by—came the crunch of boots on stone.
People appeared. A dozen Aes Sedai surrounding three men, two of them burly guards with the white
teardrops of the Flame of Tar Valon on their chests, tugging the chains in which the third stumbled as
if dazed.
Egwene jerked forward in her chair. The chained man was Rand. Eyes half-closed, head
sagging, he seemed nearly asleep, moving only as the chains directed.
“This man,” Elaida proclaimed, “has named himself the Dragon Reborn.” There was a buzz of
distaste, not as if the listeners were surprised, but as though it were not something they wanted to
hear. “This man has channeled the One Power.” The buzz was louder now, disgusted and tinged with
fear. “There is only one penalty for this, known and recognized in every nation, but pronounced only
here, in Tar Valon, in the Hall of the Tower. I call on the Amyrlin Seat to pronounce the sentence of
gentling on this man.”
Elaida’s eyes glittered at Egwene. Rand. What do I do? Light, what do I do?
“Why do you hesitate?” Elaida demanded. “The sentence has been set down for three thousand
years. Why do you hesitate, Egwene al’Vere?”
One of the Green Sitters was on her feet, anger bright through her calm. “Shame, Elaida! Show
respect for the Amyrlin Seat! Show respect for the Mother!”
“Respect,” Elaida answered coldly, “can be lost as well as won. Well, Egwene? Can it be you
show your weakness, your unfitness for your office, at last? Can it be you will not pronounce sentence
on this man?”
Rand tried to lift his head and failed.
Egwene struggled to her feet, head spinning, trying to remember she was the Amyrlin Seat with
the power to command all these women, screaming that she was a novice, that she did not belong
here, that something was dreadfully wrong. “No,” she said shakily. “No, I cannot! I will not—”
“She betrays herself!” Elaida’s shout drowned out Egwene’s attempt to speak. “She condemns

herself out of her own mouth! Take her!”
As Egwene opened her mouth, Beldeine moved beside her. Then the Keeper’s staff struck her
head.
Blackness.
First there was pain in her head. There was something hard under her back, and cold. Next came
the voices. Murmurs.
“Is she still unconscious?” It was a rasp, a file on bone.
“Do not worry,” a woman said from far, far away. She sounded uneasy, afraid, and trying not to
show either. “She will be dealt with before she knows what is happening to her. Then she is ours, to
do with as we will. Perhaps we will give her to you for sport.”
“After you make your own use of her.”
“Of course.”
The distant voices moved further away.
Her hand brushed against her leg, touched bare, pebbly flesh. She opened her eyes a crack. She
was naked, bruised, lying on a rough wooden table, in what seemed to be a disused storeroom.
Splinters stuck her back. There was a metallic taste of blood in her mouth.
A cluster of Aes Sedai stood to one side of the room, talking among themselves, voices low yet
urgent. The pain in her head made thinking difficult, but it seemed important to count them. Thirteen.
Another group, black-cloaked and hooded men, joined the Aes Sedai, who seemed caught
between cowering and trying to dominate with their presence. One of the men turned his head to look
toward the table. The dead white face within the hood had no eyes.
Egwene had no need to count the Myrddraal. She knew. Thirteen Myrddraal, and thirteen Aes
Sedai. Without another thought, she screamed in pure terror. Yet even in the midst of fear that tried to
split her bones, she reached out for the True Source, clawed desperately for saidar.
“She’s awake!”
“She cannot be! Not yet!”
“Shield her! Quickly! Quickly! Cut her off from the Source!”
“It’s too late! She is too strong!”
“Seize her! Hurry!”
Hands reached for her arms and legs. Pasty pale hands like slugs under rocks, ordered by minds
behind pale, eyeless faces. If those hands touched her flesh, she knew she would go mad. The Power
filled her.
Flames burst from Myrddraal skin, ripping through black cloth as if they were solid daggers of
fire. Shrieking Halfmen crisped and burned like oiled paper. Fist-sized chunks of stone tore
themselves free of the walls and whizzed across the room, producing shrieks and grunts as they
thudded into flesh. The air stirred, shifted, howled into a whirlwind.
Slowly, painfully, Egwene pushed herself off the table. The wind whipped her hair and made her
stagger, but she continued to drive it as she stumbled toward the door. An Aes Sedai loomed in front
of her, a woman bruised and bleeding, surrounded by the glow of the Power. A woman with death in
her dark eyes.
Egwene’s mind put a name to the face. Gyldan. Elaida’s closest confidante, always whispering
together in corners, closeting themselves in the night. Egwene’s mouth tightened. Disdaining stones
and wind, she balled up her fist and punched Gyldan between the eyes as hard as she could. The Red
sister—the Black sister—crumpled as if her bones had melted.
Rubbing her knuckles, Egwene staggered out into the hall. Thank you, Perrin, she thought, for

showing me how to do that. But you didn’t tell me how much it hurts when you do.
Shoving the door shut against the wind, she channeled. Stones around the doorway shivered,
cracked, settled against the wood. It would not hold them for long, but anything that slowed pursuit for
even a minute was worth doing. Minutes might mean life. Gathering her strength, she forced herself to
break into a run. It wobbled, but at least it was a run.
She must find some clothes, she decided. A woman clothed had more authority than the same
woman naked, and she was going to need every bit of authority. They would look for her first in her
rooms, but she had a spare dress and shoes in her study—and another stole—and that lay not far off.
It was unnerving, trotting through empty hallways. The White Tower no longer held the numbers
it once had, but there was usually someone about. The loudest sound was the slap of her bare soles on
the tiles.
She hurried through the antechamber of her study to the inner room, and at last she found
someone. Beldeine was sitting on the floor, head in her hands, weeping.
Egwene stopped warily, as Beldeine raised reddened eyes to meet hers. No glow of saidar
surrounded the Keeper, but Egwene was still cautious. And confident. She could not see her own
glow, of course, but the power—the Power—surging through her was enough. Especially when added
to her secret.
Beldeine scrubbed a hand across tearstained cheeks. “I had to. You must understand. I had to.
They. . . . They. . . .” She took a deep, shuddering breath; it all came out in a rush. “Three nights ago
they took me while I slept and stilled me.” Her voice rose to a near shriek. “They stilled me! I cannot
channel any longer!”
“Light,” Egwene breathed. The rush of saidar cushioned her against the shock. “The Light help
and comfort you, my daughter. Why didn’t you tell me? I would have. . . .” She let it trail away,
knowing there was nothing she could do.
“What would you have done? What? Nothing! There’s nothing you can do. But they said they
could give it back to me, with the power of . . . the power of the Dark One.” Her eyes squeezed shut,
leaking tears. “They hurt me, Mother, and they made me. . . . Oh, Light, they hurt me! Elaida told me
they would make me whole again, make me able to channel again, if I obeyed. That’s why I. . . . I had
to!”
“So Elaida is Black Ajah,” Egwene said grimly. A narrow wardrobe stood against the wall, and
in it hung a green silk dress, kept for when she had no time to return to her rooms. A striped stole hung
beside the dress. She began to dress herself, quickly. “What have they done with Rand? Where have
they taken him? Answer me, Beldeine! Where is Rand al’Thor?”
Beldeine huddled, lips trembling, eyes turned bleakly inward, but finally she roused herself
enough to say, “The Traitor’s Court, Mother. They took him to the Traitor’s Court.”
Shivers assaulted Egwene. Shivers of fear. Shivers of rage. Elaida had not waited, not even an
hour. The Traitor’s Court was used for only three purposes: executions, the stilling of an Aes Sedai,
or the gentling of a man who could channel. But all of the three took an order from the Amyrlin Seat.
So who wears the stole out there? Elaida, she was sure. But how could she make them accept her so
quickly, with me not tried, not sentenced? There cannot be another Amyrlin until I’ve been
stripped of stole and staff. And they’ll not find that easy to do. Light! Rand! She started for the
door.
“What can you do, Mother?” Beldeine cried. “What can you do?” It was not clear whether she
meant for Rand or for herself.
“More than anyone suspects,” Egwene said. “I never held the Oath Rod, Beldeine.” Beldeine’s

gasp followed her from the room.
Egwene’s memory still played hide-and-seek with her. She knew no woman could achieve the
shawl and the ring without pledging the Three Oaths with the Oath Rod firmly in hand, the
ter’angreal sealing her to keep those oaths as if they had been engraved on her bones at birth. No
woman became Aes Sedai without being bound to them. Yet she knew that somehow, in some fashion
she could not begin to dredge up, she had done just that.
Her shoes clicked swiftly as she ran. At least she knew now why the halls were empty. Every
Aes Sedai, except perhaps those she had left in the storeroom, every Accepted, every novice, even all
the servants, would be gathered in the Traitor’s Court, according to custom, to watch the will of Tar
Valon made fact.
And the Warders would be ringing the courtyard against the possibility that someone might try to
free the man to be gentled. The remnants of Guaire Amalasan’s armies had attempted it, at the end of
what some called the War of the Second Dragon, just before Artur Hawkwing’s rise had given Tar
Valon other things to worry it, and so had Raolin Darksbane’s followers, long years earlier. Whether
Rand had any followers or not, she could not remember, but Warders remembered such things, and
guarded against them.
If Elaida, or another, truly did wear the stole of the Amyrlin, the Warders might well not admit
her to the Traitor’s Court. She knew she could force a way in. It would need to be done quickly; there
was no point if Rand was gentled while she was still wrapping Warders in Air. Even Warders would
break if she loosed the lightnings on them, and balefire, and broke the ground under their feet.
Balefire? she wondered. But it would also do no good if she broke Tar Valon’s power to save Rand.
She had to save both.
Well short of the ways that led to the Traitor’s Court, she turned aside and climbed, up stairs and
ramps that grew narrower and tighter the higher she went, until she thrust open a trapdoor and
climbed out onto a sloping tower top, a roof of nearly white tiles. From there, she could see across
other roofs, past other towers, into the broad open well of the Traitor’s Court.
The court was crowded except for a cleared space in the middle. People filled the windows
overlooking it, crowded the balconies and even the rooftops, but she could make out the lone man,
small at that distance, swaying in his chains in the center of the cleared space. Rand. Twelve Aes
Sedai surrounded him, and another—who Egwene knew had to be wearing a seven-striped stole,
even though she could not distinguish it—stood before Rand. Elaida. The words she must be saying
crept into Egwene’s head.
This man, abandoned of the Light, has touched saidin, the male half of the True Source. Thus
do we hold him. Most abominably has this man channeled the One Power, knowing that saidin is
tainted by the Dark One, tainted for men’s pride, tainted for men’s sin. Thus do we chain him.
Forcefully, Egwene pushed the rest of it out of her thoughts. Thirteen Aes Sedai. Twelve sisters
and the Amyrlin, the traditional number for gentling. The same number as for. . . . She rid herself
of that, too. She had no time for anything but what she was there to do. If she could only manage to
reason out how.
At that distance, she thought she could manage to lift him with Air. Pick him right out of the
circle of Aes Sedai and float him straight to her. Maybe. Even if she could find the strength, even if
she did not drop him to his death halfway, it would be a slow process, with him a helpless target for
archers, and the glow of saidar pointing out her own position for any Aes Sedai who looked. Any
Myrddraal, for that matter.
“Light,” she muttered, “there’s no other way short of starting a war inside the White Tower. And

I may do that anyway.” She gathered the Power, separated skeins, directed flows.
The way back will come but once. Be steadfast.
It had been so long since she last heard those words that she gave a start, slipped on the smooth
tiles, barely caught herself short of the edge. The ground lay a hundred paces down. She looked over
her shoulder.
There on the tower top, tilted to sit flat against the sloping tiles, was a silver arch filled with a
glowing light. The arch flickered and wavered; streaks of angry red and yellow darted through the
white light.
The way back will come but once. Be steadfast.
The archway thinned to transparency, grew solid again.
Frantic, Egwene gazed toward the Traitor’s Court. There had to be time. There had to be. All
she needed was a few minutes, perhaps ten, and luck.
Voices bored into her head, not the disembodied, unknowable voice that warned her to be
steadfast, but women’s voices she almost believed she knew.
—can’t hold much longer. If she does not come out now—
Hold! Hold, burn you, or I’ll gut you all like sturgeons!
—going wild, Mother! We can’t—
The voices faded to a drone, the drone to silence, but the unknowable spoke again.
The way back will come but once. Be steadfast.
There is a price to be Aes Sedai.
The Black Ajah waits.
With a scream of rage, of loss, Egwene threw herself at the arch as it shimmered like a heat
haze. She almost wished she would miss and plunge to her death.
Light plucked her apart fiber by fiber, sliced the fibers to hairs, split the hairs to wisps of
nothing. All drifted apart on the light. Forever.

CHAPTER

Sealed

Light pulled her apart fiber by fiber, sliced the fibers to hairs that drifted apart, burning.
Drifting and burning, forever. Forever.
Egwene stepped out of the silver arch cold and stiff with anger. She wanted the iciness of anger
to counter the searing of memory. Her body remembered burning, but other memories scored and
scorched more deeply. Anger cold as death.
“Is that all there is for me?” she demanded. “To abandon him again and again. To betray him,
fail him, again and again? Is that what there is for me?”
Suddenly she realized that all was not as it should be. The Amyrlin was there now, as Egwene
had been taught she would be, and a shawled sister from each Ajah, but they all stared at her
worriedly. Two Aes Sedai now sat at each place around the ter’angreal, sweat running down their
faces. The ter’angreal hummed, almost vibrated, and violent streaks of color tore the white light
inside the arches.
The glow of saidar briefly enveloped Sheriam as she put a hand on Egwene’s head, sending a
new chill through her. “She is well.” The Mistress of Novices sounded relieved. “She is unharmed.”
As if she had not expected it.
Tension seemed to go out of the other Aes Sedai facing Egwene. Elaida let out a long breath,
then hurried away for the last chalice. Only the Aes Sedai around the ter’angreal did not relax. The
hum had lessened, and the light began the flickering that signaled the ter’angreal was settling toward
quiescence, but those Aes Sedai looked as if they were fighting it every inch of the way.
“What . . . ? What happened?” Egwene asked.
“Be silent,” Sheriam said, but gently. “For now, be silent. You are well—that is the main thing
—and we must complete the ceremony.” Elaida came, close to running, and handed the final silver
chalice to the Amyrlin.
Egwene hesitated only a moment before kneeling. What happened?
The Amyrlin emptied the chalice slowly over Egwene’s head. “You are washed clean of
Egwene al’Vere from Emond’s Field. You are washed clean of all ties that bind you to the world.
You come to us washed clean, in heart and soul. You are Egwene al’Vere, Accepted of the White
Tower.” The last drop splashed onto Egwene’s hair. “You are sealed to us, now.”
The last words seemed to have a special meaning, just between Egwene and the Amyrlin. The
Amyrlin thrust the chalice at one of the other Aes Sedai and produced a gold ring in the shape of a
serpent biting its own tail. Despite herself, Egwene trembled as she raised her left hand, trembled
again as the Amyrlin slipped the Great Serpent ring onto the third finger. When she became Aes
Sedai, she could wear the ring on the finger she chose, or not at all if it was necessary to hide who

she was, but the Accepted wore it there.
Unsmiling, the Amyrlin pulled her to her feet. “Welcome, Daughter,” she said, kissing her cheek.
Egwene was surprised to feel a thrill. Not child, but daughter. Always before she had been child. The
Amyrlin kissed her other cheek. “Welcome.”
Stepping back, the Amyrlin regarded her critically, but spoke to Sheriam. “Get her dry and into
some clothes, then be certain she is well. Certain, you understand.”
“I am certain, Mother.” Sheriam sounded surprised. “You saw me delve her.”
The Amyrlin grunted, and her eyes shifted to the ter’angreal. “I mean to know what went wrong
tonight.” She strode away in the direction of her glare, skirts swaying purposefully. Most of the other
Aes Sedai joined her around the ter’angreal, now only a silver structure of arches on a ring.
“The Mother is worried about you,” Sheriam said as she drew Egwene to one side, to where
there was a thick towel for her hair, and another for the rest of her.
“How much reason did she have?” Egwene asked. The Amyrlin wants nothing to happen to her
hound till the deer is pulled down.
Sheriam did not answer. She merely frowned slightly, then waited until Egwene was dry before
handing her a white dress banded at the bottom with seven rings.
She slipped into that dress with a flash of disappointment. She was one of the Accepted, with the
ring on her finger and the bands on her dress. Why don’t I feel any different?
Elaida came over, her arms filled with Egwene’s novice dress and shoes, her belt and pouch.
And the papers Verin had given her. In Elaida’s hands.
Egwene made herself wait for the Aes Sedai to hand the bundle to her rather than snatch them
away. “Thank you, Aes Sedai.” She tried to eye the papers surreptitiously; she could not tell if they
had been disturbed. The string was still tied. How would I know if she’s read all of them? Squeezing
her pouch under cover of the novice dress, she felt the peculiar ring, the ter’angreal, inside. At least
that’s still here. Light, she could have taken that, and I don’t know that I would have minded. Yes,
I would. I think I would.
Elaida’s face was as cold as her voice. “I did not want you to be brought forward tonight. Not
because I feared what happened; no one could foresee that. But because of what you are. A wilder.”
Egwene tried to protest, but Elaida kept on, as implacable as a mountain glacier. “Oh, I know you
learned to channel under Aes Sedai teaching, but you are still a wilder. A wilder in spirit, a wilder in
ways. You have vast potential, else you would never have survived in there tonight, but potential
changes nothing. I do not believe you will ever be part of the White Tower, not in the way the rest of
us are, no matter on which finger you wear your ring. It would have been better for you had you
settled for learning enough to stay alive, and gone back to your sleepy village. Far better.” Turning on
her heel, she stalked away, out of the chamber.
If she isn’t Black Ajah, Egwene thought sourly, she’s the next thing to it. Aloud, she muttered to
Sheriam, “You could have said something. You could have helped me.”
“I would have helped a novice, child,” Sheriam replied calmly, and Egwene winced. She was
back to “child” again. “I try to protect novices where they need it, since they cannot protect
themselves. You are Accepted, now. It is time for you to learn to protect yourself.”
Egwene studied Sheriam’s eyes, wondering if she had imagined an emphasis on that last
sentence. Sheriam had had as much opportunity as Elaida to read the list of names, to decide that
Egwene was mixed in with the Black Ajah. Light, you’re becoming suspicious of everybody. Better
that than dead, or captured by thirteen of them and. . . . Hastily, she stopped that line of thought; she
did not want it in her head. “Sheriam, what did happen tonight?” she asked. “And don’t put me off.”

Sheriam’s eyebrows rose almost to her scalp, it seemed, and she hastily amended her question.
“Sheriam Sedai, I mean. Forgive me, Sheriam Sedai.”
“Remember you aren’t Aes Sedai yet, child.” Despite the steel in her voice, a smile touched
Sheriam’s lips, yet it vanished as she went on. “I do not know what happened. Except that I very much
fear you almost died.”
“Who knows what happens to those who do not come out of a ter’angreal?” Alanna said as she
joined them. The Green sister was known for her temper and her sense of humor, and some said she
could flash from one to the other and back again before you could blink, but the look she gave Egwene
was almost diffident. “Child, I should have stopped this when I had the chance, when I first noticed
that—reverberation. It came back. That is what happened. It came back a thousandfold. Ten thousand.
The ter’angreal almost seemed to be trying to shut off the flow from saidar—or melt itself through
the floor. You have my apologies, though words are not enough. Not for what almost happened to you.
I say this, and by the First Oath you know it is true. To show my feelings, I will ask the Mother to let
me share your time in the kitchens. And, yes, your visit to Sheriam, too. Had I done as I should, you
would not have been in danger of your life, and I will atone for it.”
Sheriam’s laugh was scandalized. “She will never allow that, Alanna. A sister in the kitchens,
much less. . . . It is unheard of. It’s impossible! You did what you believed right. There is no fault to
you.”
“It was not your fault, Alanna Sedai,” Egwene said. Why is Alanna doing this? Unless maybe to
convince me she didn’t have anything to do with whatever went wrong. And maybe so she can keep
an eye on me all the time. It was that image, a proud Aes Sedai up to her elbows in greasy pots three
times a day just to watch someone, that convinced her she was letting her imagination run away with
her. But it was also unthinkable that Alanna should do as she said she would. In any case, the Green
sister certainly had had no chance to see the list of names while tending the ter’angreal. But if
Nynaeve is right, she wouldn’t need to see those names to want to kill me if she is Black Ajah. Stop
that! “Really, it wasn’t.”
“Had I done as I should,” Alanna maintained, “it would never have happened. The only time I
have ever seen anything like it was once years ago when we tried to use a ter’angreal in the same
room with another that may have been in some way related to it. It is extremely rare to find two such
as that. The pair of them melted, and every sister within a hundred paces had such a headache for a
week that she couldn’t channel a spark. What’s the matter, child?”
Egwene’s hand had tightened around her pouch till the twisted stone ring impressed itself on her
palm through the thick cloth. Was it warm? Light, I did it myself. “Nothing, Alanna Sedai. Aes Sedai,
you did nothing wrong. You have no reason to share my punishments. None at all. None!”
“A bit vehement,” Sheriam observed, “but true.” Alanna only shook her head.
“Aes Sedai,” Egwene said slowly, “what does it mean to be Green Ajah?” Sheriam’s eyes
opened wider with amusement, and Alanna grinned openly.
“Just with the ring on your finger,” the Green sister said, “and already trying to decide which
Ajah to choose? First, you must love men. I don’t mean be in love with them, but love them. Not like a
Blue, who merely likes men, so long as they share her causes and do not get in her way. And certainly
not like a Red, who despises them as if every one of them were responsible for the Breaking.”
Alviarin, the White sister who had come with the Amyrlin, gave them a cool look and moved on.
“And not like a White,” Alanna said with a laugh, “who has no room in her life for any passions at
all.”
“That was not what I meant, Alanna Sedai. I want to know what itmeans to be a Green sister.”

She was not sure Alanna would understand, because she was not certain she herself understood what
she wanted to know, but Alanna nodded slowly as if she did.
“Browns seek knowledge, Blues meddle in causes, and Whites consider the questions of truth
with implacable logic. We all do some of it all, of course. But to be a Green means to stand ready.” A
note of pride entered Alanna’s voice. “In the Trolloc Wars, we were often called the Battle Ajah. All
Aes Sedai helped where and when they could, but the Green Ajah alone was always with the armies,
in almost every battle. We were the counter to the Dreadlords. The Battle Ajah. And now we stand
ready, for the Trollocs to come south again, for Tarmon Gai’don, the Last Battle. We will be there.
That is what it means to be a Green.”
“Thank you, Aes Sedai,” Egwene said. That is what I was? Or what I will be? Light, I wish I
knew if it was real, if it had anything at all to do with here and now.
The Amyrlin joined them, and they swept deep curtsies to her. “Are you well, Daughter?” she
asked Egwene. Her eyes flicked to the corner of the papers sticking out from under the novice dress in
Egwene’s hands, then back to Egwene’s face immediately. “I will know the why of what occurred
tonight before I am done.”
Egwene’s cheeks reddened. “I am well, Mother.”
Alanna surprised her by asking the Amyrlin just what she had said she would.
“I never heard of such a thing,” the Amyrlin barked. “The owner doesn’t muck out with the bilge
boys even if he has run the boat on a mud-flat.” She glanced at Egwene, and worry tightened her eyes.
And anger. “I share your concern, Alanna. Whatever this child has done, it did not deserve that. Very
well. If it will assuage your feelings, you may visit Sheriam. But it is to be strictly between you two.
I’ll not have Aes Sedai held up to ridicule, even inside the Tower.”
Egwene opened her mouth to confess all and let them take the ring—I don’t want the bloody
thing, really—but Alanna forestalled her.
“And the other, Mother?”
“Do not be ridiculous, Daughter.” The Amyrlin was angry, and sounded more so by the word.
“You’d be a laughingstock inside the day, except for those who decided you were mad. And don’t
think it would not follow you. Tales like that have a way of traveling. You would find stories told of
the scullion Aes Sedai from Tear to Maradon. And that would reflect on every sister. No. If you need
to rid yourself of some feeling of guilt and cannot handle it as a grown woman would, very well. I
have told you that you may visit Sheriam. Accompany her tonight when you leave here. That will give
you the rest of the night to decide if it was of any help. And tomorrow you can start finding out what
went wrong here tonight!”
“Yes, Mother.” Alanna’s voice was perfectly neutral.
The desire to confess had died in Egwene. Alanna had shown only one brief flash of
disappointment, when she realized the Amyrlin would not allow her to join Egwene in the kitchens.
She doesn’t want to be punished any more than any sensible person does. She did want an excuse
to be in my company. Light, she couldn’t have deliberately caused the ter’angreal to go wild; I did
that. Can she be Black Ajah?
Wrapped in thought, Egwene heard a throat cleared, then again, more roughly. Her eyes focused.
The Amyrlin was staring right into her, and when she spoke, she bit off each word.
“Since you seem to be asleep standing up, child, I suggest you go to bed.” For one instant her
glance flashed to the nearly concealed papers in Egwene’s hands. “You have much work to do
tomorrow, and for many days thereafter.” Her eyes held Egwene’s a moment longer, and then she was
striding away before any of them could curtsy.

Sheriam rounded on Alanna as soon as the Amyrlin was out of earshot. The Green Aes Sedai
glowered and took it in silence. “You are mad, Alanna! A fool, and doubly a fool if you think I will
go lightly on you just because we were novices together. Are you taken by the Dragon, to—?”
Suddenly Sheriam became aware of Egwene, and the target of her anger shifted. “Did I not hear the
Amyrlin Seat order you to your bed, Accepted? If you breathe a word of this, you will wish I had
buried you in a field to manure the ground. And I will see you in my study in the morning, when the
bell rings First and not one breath later. Now, go!”
Egwene went, her head spinning. Is there anybody I can trust? The Amyrlin? She sent us off
chasing thirteen of the Black Ajah and forgot to mention that thirteen is just the number needed to
turn a woman who can channel to the Shadow against her will. Who can I trust?
She did not want to be alone, could not stand the thought of it, and so she hurried to the
Accepted’s quarters, thinking that tomorrow she would be moving there herself, and immediately
after knocking pushed open Nynaeve’s door. She could trust her with anything. Her and Elayne.
But Nynaeve was seated in one of the two chairs, with Elayne’s head buried in her lap. Elayne’s
shoulders shook to the sound of weeping, the softer weeping that comes after no energy is left for
deeper sobs but the emotion still burns. Dampness shone on Nynaeve’s cheeks, too. The Great
Serpent gleaming on her hand, smoothing Elayne’s hair, matched the ring on the hand Elayne used to
clutch at Nynaeve’s skirt.
Elayne lifted a face red and swollen from long crying, sniffing through her sobs when she saw
Egwene. “I could not be that awful, Egwene. I just couldn’t!”
The accident with the ter’angreal, Egwene’s fear that someone might have read the papers Verin
had given her, her suspicions of everyone in that chamber, all these had been terrible, but they had
buffered her in a rough, ungentle way from what had happened inside the ter’angreal. They had come
from outside; the other was inside. Elayne’s words stripped the buffer away, and what was inside hit
Egwene as if the ceiling had collapsed. Rand her husband, and Joiya her baby. Rand pinned and
begging her to kill him. Rand chained to be gentled.
Before she was aware of moving, she was on her knees beside Elayne, all the tears that should
have fallen earlier coming out in a flood. “I couldn’t help him, Nynaeve,” she sobbed. “I just left him
there.”
Nynaeve flinched as if struck, but the next moment her arms were around both Egwene and
Elayne, hugging them, rocking them. “Hush,” she crooned softly. “It eases with time. It eases, a little.
One day we will make them pay our price. Hush. Hush.”

CHAPTER

Scouting and Discoveries

Sunlight through the carved shutters, creeping across the bed, woke Mat. For a moment, he only
lay there, frowning. He had not reasoned out any plan for escaping from Tar Valon before sleep had
overtaken him, but neither had he given up. Too much memory still lay covered with fog, but he
would not give up.
Two serving women came bustling with hot water and a tray heavy with food, laughing and
telling him how much better he looked already, and how soon he would be back on his feet if he did
what the Aes Sedai told him. He answered them curtly, trying not to sound bitter. Let them think I
mean to go along. His stomach rumbled at the smells from the tray.
When they left, he tossed aside his blanket and hopped out of bed, pausing only to stuff half a
slice of ham into his mouth before pouring out water to wash and shave. Staring into the mirror above
the washstand, he paused in lathering his face. He did look better.
His cheeks were still hollow, but not quite as hollow as they had been. The dark circles had
vanished from under his eyes, which no longer seemed set so deep in his head. It was as if every bite
he had eaten the night before had gone into putting meat on his bones. He even felt stronger.
“At this rate,” he muttered, “I will be gone before they know it.” But he was still surprised
when, after shaving, he sat down and consumed every scrap of ham, turnip, and pear on the tray.
He was sure they expected him to climb back into bed once he had eaten, but instead, he dressed.
Stamping his feet to settle them in his boots, he eyed his spare clothes and decided to leave them, for
now. I have to know what I’m doing, first. And if I have to leave them. . . . He tucked the dice cups
into his pouch. With those, he could get all the clothes he needed.
Opening the door, he peeked out. More doors paneled in pale, golden wood lined the hall, with
colorful tapestries between, and a runner of blue carpet ran down the white-tiled floor. But there was
no one out there. No guard. He tossed his cloak over one shoulder and hurried out. Now to find a way
outside.
It took some little wandering, down stairs and along corridors and across open courts, before he
found what he wanted, a doorway to the outside, and he saw people before then: serving women and
white-clad novices hurrying about their chores, the novices running even harder than the servants; a
handful of roughly dressed male servants carrying large chests and other heavy loads; Accepted in
their banded dresses. Even a few Aes Sedai.
The Aes Sedai did not seem to notice him as they strode along, intent on whatever purpose, or
else they gave him no more than a passing glance. His were country clothes, but well made; he did not
look a vagabond, and the serving men showed that men were allowed in this part of the Tower. He
suspected they might take him for another servant, and that was just as well with him, so long as no
one asked him to lift anything.

He did feel some regret that none of the women he saw was Egwene or Nynaeve, or even
Elayne. She’s a pretty one, even if she does have her nose in the air half the time. And she could
tell me how to find Egwene and the Wisdom. I cannot go without saying goodbye. Light, I don’t
suppose one of them would turn me in, just because they are becoming Aes Sedai themselves? Burn
me, for a fool! They’d never do that. Anyway, I will risk it.
But once out-of-doors, under a bright morning sky with only a few drifting white clouds, he put
the women from his mind for the time. He was looking across a wide, flagstoned yard with a plain
stone fountain in the middle and a barracks on the other side that was made of gray stone. It looked
almost like a huge boulder among the few trees growing out of rimmed holes in the flagstones close
by. Guardsmen in their shirtsleeves sat in front of the long, low building, tending weapons and armor
and harness. Guardsmen were what he wanted, now.
He sauntered across the yard and watched the soldiers as if he had nothing better to do. As they
worked they talked and laughed among themselves like men after the harvest. Now and again one of
them looked curiously at Mat as he strolled among them, but none challenged his right to be there.
From time to time he asked a casual question. And finally he got the answer he sought.
“Bridge guard?” said a stocky, dark-haired man no more than five years older than Mat. His
words had a heavy Illianer accent. Young he might have been, but a thin white scar crossed his left
cheek, and the hands oiling his sword moved with familiarity and competence. He squinted up at Mat
before returning to his task. “I do be on the bridge guard, and back there again this even. Why do you
ask?”
“I was just wondering what conditions were like on the other side of the river.” I might as well
find that out, too. “Good for traveling? It can’t be muddy, unless you have had more rain than I know
about.”
“Which side of the river?” the guardsman asked placidly. His eyes did not lift from the oiled rag
he was running along his blade.
“Uh . . . east. The east side.”
“No mud. Whitecloaks.” The man leaned to one side to spit, but his voice did not change.
“Whitecloaks do be poking their noses into every village for ten miles. They have no hurt anyone yet,
but them just being there do upset the folk. Fortune prick me if I do no think they wish to provoke us,
for they do look as if they would attack if they could. No good for anyone who do want to travel.”
“What about west, then?”
“The same.” The guardsman raised his eyes to Mat’s. “But you will no be crossing, lad, east or
west. Your name do be Matrim Cauthon, or Fortune abandon me. Last night a sister, herself in person,
did come to the bridge where I did stand guard. She did drill your features at us till each could speak
them back to her. A guest, she did say, and no to be harmed. But no to be allowed out of the city,
either, if you must be tied hand and foot to keep you from it.” His eyes narrowed. “Is it that you did
steal something from them?” he asked doubtfully. “You do no have the look of those the sisters do
guest.”
“I didn’t steal anything!” Mat said indignantly. Burn me, I didn’t even get a chance to work
around to it easy. They must all know me. “I’m no thief!”
“No, it is no that I do see in your face. No thievery. But you do have the look of the fellow who
did try to sell me the Horn of Valere three days gone. So he did claim it did be, all bent and battered
as it did be. Do you have a Horn of Valere to sell? Or mayhap it do be the Dragon’s sword?”
Mat gave a jump at the mention of the Horn, but he managed to keep his voice level. “I was
sick.” Others of the guardsmen were looking at him now. Light, they’ll all know I am not supposed

to leave, now. He forced a laugh. “The sisters Healed me.” Some of the guardsmen frowned at him.
Perhaps they thought other men should show more respect than to call the Aes Sedai sisters. “I guess
the Aes Sedai don’t want me to go before I have all my strength back.” He tried willing the men, all
of those watching him now, to accept that. Just a man who was Healed. Nothing more. No reason to
trouble yourself about him any further.
The Illianer nodded. “You do have the look of sickness in your face, too. Perhaps that do be the
reason. But never did I hear of so much effort to keep one sick man in the city.”
“That’s the reason,” Mat said firmly. They were all still looking at him. “Well, I need to be
going. They said I have to take walks. Lots of long walks. To build up strength, you know.”
He felt their eyes following him as he left, and he scowled. He had simply meant to find out how
well his description had been passed around. If only the officers among the bridge guards had had it,
he might have been able to slip by. He had always been good at slipping into places unseen. And out.
It was a talent you developed when your mother always suspected you were up to some mischief and
you had two sisters to tell on you. And now I’ve made sure half a barracks full of guardsmen will
know me. Blood and bloody ashes!
Much of the Tower grounds were gardens full of trees, leatherleaf and paperbark and elms, and
he soon found himself walking along a wide, twisting graveled path. It could have led through
countryside, if not for the towers visible over the treetops. And the white bulk of the Tower itself,
behind him but pressing on him as if he carried it on his shoulders. If there were ways out of the
Tower grounds that were not watched, this seemed the place to find them. If they existed.
A girl in novice white appeared ahead on the path, striding purposefully toward him. Wrapped
in her own thoughts, she did not see him at first. When she came close enough for him to make out her
big, dark eyes and the way her hair was braided, he grinned suddenly. He knew this girl—memory
drifting up from shrouded depths—though he would never have expected to find her here. He had
never expected to see her again at all. He grinned to himself. Good luck to balance bad. As he
remembered, she had quite an eye for the boys.
“Else,” he called to her. “Else Grinwell. You remember me, don’t you? Mat Cauthon. A friend
and I visited your father’s farm. Remember? Have you decided to become Aes Sedai, then?”
She stopped short, staring at him. “What are you doing up and out?” she said coldly.
“You know about that, do you?” He moved closer to her, but she stepped back, keeping her
distance. He stopped. “It’s not catching. I was Healed, Else.” Those large, dark eyes seemed more
knowing than he remembered, and not nearly so warm, but he supposed studying to be an Aes Sedai
could do that. “What is the matter, Else? You look like you don’t know me.”
“I know you,” she said. Her manner was not as he remembered, either; he thought she could give
Elayne lessons now. “I have . . . work to be about. Let me by.”
He grimaced. The path was broad enough for six to walk abreast without crowding. “I told you it
isn’t catching.”
“Let me by!”
Muttering to himself, he stepped to one edge of the gravel. She went past him along the other
side, watching to make sure he did not come closer. Once by, she quickened her steps, glancing over
her shoulder at him until she was out of sight around a bend.
Wanted to make sure I didn’t follow her, he thought sourly. First the guardsmen, and now Else.
My luck is not in, today.
He started off again, and soon heard a ferocious clatter from one side ahead, like dozens of
sticks being beat together. Curious, he turned off toward it, into the trees.

A little way brought him to a large expanse of bare ground, the earth beaten hard, at least fifty
paces across and nearly twice as long. At intervals around it under the trees stood wooden stands
holding quarterstaffs, and practice swords made of strips of wood bound loosely together, and a few
real swords and axes and spears.
Spaced across the open ground, pairs of men, most stripped to the waist, flailed at each other
with more practice swords. Some moved so smoothly it almost seemed they danced with one another,
flowing from stance to stance, stroke to counterstroke in continuous motion. There was nothing
quickly apparent aside from skill to mark them from the others, but Mat was sure he was watching
Warders.
Those who did not move so smoothly were all younger, each pair under the watchful eyes of an
older man who seemed to radiate a dangerous grace even standing still. Warders and students , Mat
decided.
He was not the only audience. Not ten paces from him, half a dozen women with ageless Aes
Sedai faces and as many more in the banded white dresses of the Accepted stood watching one pair
of students, bare to the waist and slick with sweat, under the guidance of a Warder shaped much like
a block of stone. The Warder used a short-stemmed pipe in one hand, trailing tabac smoke, to direct
his pupils.
Sitting down cross-legged under a leatherleaf, Mat rooted three large pebbles out of the ground
and began to juggle them idly. He did not feel weak, exactly, but it was good to sit. If there was a way
out of the Tower grounds, it would not go away while he took a short rest.
Before he had been there five minutes he knew who it was the Aes Sedai and Accepted were
watching. One of the blocky Warder’s pupils was a tall, lithe young man who moved like a cat. And
almost as pretty as a girl, Mat thought wryly. Every woman was staring at the tall fellow with
sparkling eyes, even the Aes Sedai.
The tall man handled his practice sword almost as deftly as the Warders, now and then earning
an approving gravelly comment from his teacher. It was not that his opponent, a youth more Mat’s
age, with red-gold hair, was unskilled. Far from it, as much as Mat could see, though he had never
claimed to know anything about swords. The golden-haired man met every lightning attack, turning it
away before the bound strips could strike him, and even launched an occasional attack of his own.
But the handsome fellow countered those attacks and flowed back into his own in the space of a
heartbeat.
Mat shifted the pebbles to one hand, but kept them spinning in the air. He did not think he would
care to face either of them. Certainly not with a sword.
“Break!” The Warder’s voice sounded like rocks emptying out of a bucket. Chests heaving, the
two men let their practice swords fall to their sides. Sweat matted their hair. “You can rest till I finish
my pipe. But rest fast; I am almost in the dottle.”
Now that they had stopped dancing about, Mat got a good look at the youth with the red-gold hair
and let the pebbles drop. Burn me, I’ll bet my whole purse that’s Elayne’s brother. And the other
one’s Galad, or I’ll eat my boots. On the journey from Toman Head it had seemed half of Elayne’s
conversation had been of Gawyn’s virtues and Galad’s vices. Oh, Gawyn had some vices according
to Elayne, but they were small; to Mat they sounded like the sort of things no one but a sister would
consider vices at all. As for Galad, once Elayne was pinned down, he sounded like what every
mother said she wanted her son to be. Mat did not think he wanted to spend much time in Galad’s
company. Egwene blushed whenever Galad was mentioned, though she seemed to think no one
noticed.

A ripple seemed to pass through the watching women when Gawyn and Galad stopped, and they
appeared on the point of stepping forward almost as one. But Gawyn caught sight of Mat, said
something quietly to Galad, and the two of them walked by the women. The Aes Sedai and Accepted
turned to follow with their eyes. Mat scrambled to his feet as the pair approached.
“You are Mat Cauthon, are you not?” Gawyn said with a grin. “I was sure I recognized you from
Egwene’s description. And Elayne’s. I understand you were sick. Are you better now?”
“I’m fine,” Mat said. He wondered if he was supposed to call Gawyn “my Lord” or something
of the sort. He had refused to call Elayne “my Lady”—not that she had demanded it, actually—and he
decided he would not do her brother better.
“Did you come to the practice yard to learn the sword?” Galad asked.
Mat shook his head. “I was only out walking. I don’t know much about swords. I think I’ll put my
trust in a good bow, or a good quarterstaff. I know how to use those.”
“If you spend much time around Nynaeve,” Galad said, “you’ll need bow, quarterstaff, and
sword to protect yourself. And I don’t know whether that would be enough.”
Gawyn looked at him wonderingly. “Galad, you just very nearly made a joke.”
“I do have a sense of humor, Gawyn,” Galad said with a frown. “You only think I do not because
I do not care to mock people.”
With a shake of his head, Gawyn turned back to Mat. “You should learn something of the sword.
Everyone can do with that sort of knowledge these days. Your friend—Rand al’Thor—carried a most
unusual sword. What do you hear of him?”
“I haven’t seen Rand in a long time,” Mat said quickly. Just for a moment, when he had
mentioned Rand, Gawyn’s look had gained intensity. Light, does he know about Rand? He couldn’t.
If he did, he’d be denouncing me for a Darkfriend just for being Rand’s friend. But he knows
something. “Swords aren’t the be-all and end-all, you know. I could do fairly well against either of
you, I think, if you had a sword and I had my quarterstaff.”
Gawyn’s cough was obviously meant to swallow a laugh. Much too politely, he said, “You must
be very good.” Galad’s face was frankly disbelieving.
Perhaps it was that they both clearly thought he was making a wild boast. Perhaps it was
because he had mishandled questioning the guardsman. Perhaps it was because Else, who had such an
eye for the boys, wanted nothing to do with him, and all those women were staring at Galad like cats
watching a jug of cream. Aes Sedai and Accepted or not, they were still women. All these
explanations ran through Mat’s head, but he rejected them angrily, especially the last. He was going to
do it because it would be fun. And it might earn some coin. His luck would not even have to be back.
“I will wager,” he said, “two silver marks to two from each of you that I can beat both of you at
once, just the way I said. You can’t have fairer odds than that. There are two of you, and one of me,
so two to one are fair odds.” He almost laughed aloud at the consternation on their faces.
“Mat,” Gawyn said, “there’s no need to make wagers. You have been sick. Perhaps we will try
this some time when you are stronger.”
“It would be far from a fair wager,” Galad said. “I’ll not take your wager, now or later. You are
from the same village as Egwene, are you not? I . . . I would not have her angry with me.”
“What does she have to do with it? Thump me once with one of your swords, and I will hand
over a silver mark to each of you. If I thump you till you quit, you give me two each. Don’t you think
you can do it?”
“This is ridiculous,” Galad said. “You would have no chance against one trained swordsman, let
alone two. I’ll not take such advantage.”

“Do you think that?” asked a gravel voice. The blocky Warder joined them, thick black
eyebrows pulled down in a scowl. “You think you two are good enough with your swords to take a
boy with a stick?”
“It would not be fair, Hammar Gaidin,” Galad said.
“He has been sick,” Gawyn added. “There is no need for this.”
“To the yard,” Hammar grated with a jerk of his head back over his shoulder. Galad and Gawyn
gave Mat regretful looks, then obeyed. The Warder eyed Mat up and down doubtfully. “Are you sure
you’re up to this, lad? Now I take a close look at you, you ought to be in a sickbed.”
“I am already out of one,” Mat said, “and I’m up to it. I have to be. I don’t want to lose my two
marks.”
Hammar’s heavy brows rose in surprise. “You mean to hold to that wager, lad?”
“I need the money.” Mat laughed.
His laughter cut off abruptly as he turned toward the nearest stand that held quarterstaffs and his
knees almost buckled. He stiffened them so quickly he thought anyone who noticed would think he had
just stumbled. At the stand he took his time choosing out a staff, nearly two inches thick and almost a
foot taller than he was. I have to win this. I opened my fool mouth, and now I have to win. I can’t
afford to lose those two marks. Without those to build on, it will take forever to win the money I
need.
When he turned back, the quarterstaff in both hands before him, Gawyn and Galad were already
waiting out where they had been practicing. I have to win. “Luck,” he muttered. “Time to toss the
dice.”
Hammar gave him an odd look. “You speak the Old Tongue, lad?”
Mat stared back at him for a moment, not speaking. He felt cold to the bone. With an effort, he
made his feet start out onto the practice yard. “Remember the wager,” he said loudly. “Two silver
marks from each of you against two from me.”
A buzz rose from the Accepted as they realized what was happening. The Aes Sedai watched in
silence. Disapproving silence.
Gawyn and Galad split apart, one to either side of him, keeping their distance, neither with his
sword more than half-raised.
“No wager,” Gawyn said. “There’s no wager.”
At the same time, Galad said, “I’ll not take your money like this.”
“I mean to take yours,” Mat said.
“Done!” Hammar roared. “If they have not the nerve to cover your wager, lad, I’ll pay the score
myself.”
“Very well,” Gawyn said. “If you insist on it—done!”
Galad hesitated a moment more before growling, “Done, then. Let us put an end to this farce.”
The moment’s warning was all Mat needed. As Galad rushed at him, he slid his hands along the
quarterstaff and pivoted. The end of the staff thudded into the tall man’s ribs, bringing a grunt and a
stumble. Mat let the staff bounce off Galad and spun, carrying it on around just as Gawyn came within
range. The staff dipped, darted under Gawyn’s practice sword, and clipped his ankle out from under
him. As Gawyn fell, Mat completed the spin in time to catch Galad across his upraised wrist, sending
his practice sword flying. As if his wrist did not pain him at all, Galad threw himself into a smooth,
rolling dive and came up with his sword in both hands.
Ignoring him for the moment, Mat half turned, twisting his wrists to whip the length of the staff
back beside him. Gawyn, just starting to rise, took the blow on the side of his head with a loud thump

only partly softened by the padding of hair. He went down in a heap.
Mat was only vaguely aware of an Aes Sedai rushing out to tend Elayne’s fallen brother. I hope
he’s all right. He should be. I’ve hit myself harder than that falling off a fence. He still had Galad
to deal with, and from the way Galad was poised on the balls of his feet, sword raised precisely, he
had begun to take Mat seriously.
Mat’s legs chose that moment to tremble. Light, I can’t weaken now. But he could feel it
creeping back in, the wobbly feeling, the hunger as if he had not eaten for days. If I wait for him to
come to me, I’ll fall on my face. It was hard to keep his knees straight as he started forward. Luck,
stay with me.
From the first blow, he knew that luck, or skill, or whatever had brought him this far, was still
there. Galad managed to turn that one with a sharp clack, and the next, and the next, and the next, but
strain stiffened his face. That smooth swordsman, almost as good as the Warders, fought with every
ounce of his skill to keep Mat’s staff from him. He did not attack; it was all he could do to defend. He
moved continually to the side, trying not to be forced back, and Mat pressed him, staff a blur. And
Galad stepped back, stepped back again, wooden blade a thin shield against the quarterstaff.
Hunger gnawed at Mat as if he had swallowed weasels. Sweat rolled down into his eyes, and
his strength began to fade as if it leached out with the sweat. Not yet. I can’t fall yet. I have to win.
Now. With a roar, he threw all his reserves into one last surge.
The quarterstaff flickered past Galad’s sword and in quick succession struck knee, wrist, and
ribs and finally thrust into Galad’s stomach like a spear. With a groan, Galad folded over, fighting not
to fall. The staff quivered in Mat’s hands, on the point of a final crushing thrust to the throat. Galad
sank to the ground.
Mat almost dropped the quarterstaff when he realized what he had been about to do. Win, not
kill. Light, what was I thinking? Reflexively he grounded the butt of the staff, and as soon he did, he
had to clutch at it to hold himself erect. Hunger hollowed him like a knife reaming marrow from a
bone. Suddenly he realized that not only the Aes Sedai and Accepted were watching. All practice, all
learning, had stopped. Warders and students alike stood watching him.
Hammar moved to stand beside Galad, still groaning on the ground and trying to push himself up.
The Warder raised his voice to shout, “Who was the greatest blademaster of all time?”
From the throats of dozens of students came a massed bellow. “Jearom, Gaidin!”
“Yes!” Hammar shouted, turning to make sure all heard. “During his lifetime, Jearom fought over
ten thousand times, in battle and single combat. He was defeated once. By a farmer with a
quarterstaff! Remember that. Remember what you just saw.” He lowered his eyes to Galad, and
lowered his voice as well. “If you cannot get up by now, lad, it is finished.” He raised a hand, and the
Aes Sedai and Accepted rushed to surround Galad.
Mat slid down the staff to his knees. None of the Aes Sedai even glanced his way. One of the
Accepted did, a plump girl he might have liked to ask for a dance if she were not going to be an Aes
Sedai. She frowned at him, sniffed, and turned back to peering at what the Aes Sedai were doing
around Galad.
Gawyn was on his feet, Mat noted with relief. He pulled himself up as Gawyn came over.
Mustn’t let them know. I’ll never get out of here if they decide to nurse me from sunup to sunup.
Blood darkened the red-gold hair on the side of Gawyn’s head, but there was neither cut nor bruise
apparent.
He pushed two silver marks into Mat’s hand with a dry “I think I will listen next time.” He
noticed Mat’s glance, touched his head. “They Healed it, but it was not bad. Elayne has given me

worse more than once. You are good with that.”
“Not as good as my da. He’s won the quarterstaff at Bel Tine every year as long as I can
remember, except once or twice when Rand’s da did.” That interested look came back into Gawyn’s
eyes, and Mat wished he had never mentioned Tam al’Thor. The Aes Sedai and the Accepted were
all still clustered around Galad. “I . . . I must have hurt him badly. I did not mean to do that.”
Gawyn glanced that way—there was nothing to be seen but two rings of women’s backs,
Accepted’s white dresses making the outer ring as they peered over the shoulders of crouching Aes
Sedai—and laughed. “You did not kill him—I heard him groaning—so he should be on his feet by
now, but they are not going to let this chance pass, now they have their hands on him. Light, four of
them are Green Ajah!” Mat gave him a confused look—Green Ajah? What does that have to do with
anything?—and Gawyn shook his head. “It doesn’t matter. Just rest assured that the worst Galad has
to worry about is finding himself Warder to a Green Aes Sedai before his head clears.” He laughed.
“No, they would not do that. But I will wager you those two marks of mine in your hand that some of
them wish they could.”
“Not your marks,” Mat said, shoving them in his coat pocket, “mine.” The explanation had made
little sense to him. Except that Galad was well. All he knew of what passed between Warders and
Aes Sedai were the pieces he remembered of Lan and Moiraine, and there was nothing there like
what Gawyn seemed to be suggesting. “Do you think they’d mind if I collected my wager from him?”
“They very likely would,” Hammar said dryly as he joined them. “You are not very popular with
those particular Aes Sedai right now.” He snorted. “You’d think even Green Aes Sedai would be
better than girls just loose from their mother’s apron strings. He isn’t that good-looking.”
“He is not,” Mat agreed.
Gawyn grinned at both of them, until Hammar glared at him. “Here,” the Warder said, pushing
two more silver coins into Mat’s hand. “I will collect from Galad later. Where are you from, lad?”
“Manetheren.” Mat froze when he heard the name come out of his mouth. “I mean, I’m from the
Two Rivers. I have heard too many old stories.” They just looked at him without saying anything. “I.
. . . I think I will go back and see if I can find something to eat.” Not even the Midmorning bell had
rung yet, but they nodded as if it made sense.
He kept the quarterstaff—no one had told him to put it back—and walked slowly until the trees
hid him from the practice yard. When they did, he leaned on the staff as though it were the only thing
holding him up. He was not sure it was not.
He thought that if he parted his coat, he would see a hole where his stomach should have been, a
hole growing larger as it pulled the rest of him in. But he hardly thought of hunger. He kept hearing
voices in his head. You speak the Old Tongue, lad? Manetheren. It made him shiver. Light help me,
I keep digging myself deeper. I have to get out of here. But how? He hobbled back toward the
Tower proper like an old, old man. How?

CHAPTER
25

Questions

Egwene lay across Nynaeve’s bed, chin in her hands, watching Nynaeve pace back and forth.
Elayne sprawled in front of the fireplace, which was still full of the ashes of last night’s fire. Yet
again Elayne was studying the list of names Verin had produced, patiently reading every word one
more time. The other pages, the list of ter’angreal, sat on the table; after one shocked reading they
had not discussed that one further, though they had talked of everything else. And argued, too.
Egwene stifled a yawn. It was only the middle of the morning, but none of them had gotten much
sleep. They had had to be up early. For the kitchens, and breakfast. For other things that she refused to
think about. The little sleep she herself had managed had been filled with unpleasant dreams. Maybe
Anaiya could help me understand them, those that need understanding, but. . . . But what if she is
Black Ajah? After staring at every woman in that chamber last night, wondering which was Black
Ajah, she was finding trust for anyone but her two companions hard to come by. But she did wish she
had some way of interpreting those dreams.
The nightmares about what had happened inside the ter’angreal last night were easy enough to
understand, though they had made her wake up weeping. She had dreamed of the Seanchan, too, of
women in dresses with lightning bolts woven on their breasts, collaring a long line of women who
wore Great Serpent rings, forcing them to call lightning against the White Tower. That had started her
awake in a cold sweat, but that had to be just a nightmare, too. And the dream about Whitecloaks
binding her father’s hands. A nightmare brought on by homesickness, she supposed. But the others. . . .
She glanced at the other two women again. Elayne was still reading. Nynaeve still paced with
that steady tread.
There had been a dream of Rand, reaching for a sword that seemed to be made of crystal, never
seeing the fine net dropping over him. And one of him kneeling in a chamber where a parched wind
blew dust across the floor, and creatures like the one on the Dragon banner, but much smaller, floated
on that wind, and settled into his skin. There had been a dream of him walking down into a great hole
in a black mountain, a hole filled with a reddish glare as from vast fires below, and even a dream of
him confronting Seanchan.
About that last, she was uncertain, but she knew the others had to mean something. Back when
she had been sure she could trust Anaiya, back before she had left the Tower, before she learned the
reality of the Black Ajah, a little cautious questioning of the Aes Sedai—done, oh, so carefully, so
Anaiya would think it no more than the curiosity she showed about other things—had revealed that a
Dreamer’s dreams about ta’veren were almost always significant, and the more strongly ta’veren, the
more “almost always” became “certainly.”
But Mat and Perrin were ta’veren, too, and she had also dreamed of them. Odd dreams, even
more difficult to understand than the dreams of Rand. Perrin with a falcon on his shoulder, and Perrin

with a hawk. Only the hawk held a leash in her talons—Egwene was somehow convinced both hawk
and falcon were female—and the hawk was trying to fasten it around Perrin’s neck. That made her
shiver even now; she did not like dreams about leashes. And that dream of Perrin—with a beard!—
leading a huge pack of wolves that stretched as far as the eye could see. Those about Mat had been
even nastier. Mat, placing his own left eye on a balance scale. Mat, hanging by his neck from a tree
limb. There had been a dream of Mat and Seanchan, too, but she was willing to dismiss that as a
nightmare. It had to have been just a nightmare. Just like the one about Mat speaking the Old Tongue.
That had to come from what she had heard during his Healing.
She sighed, and the sigh turned into another yawn. She and the others had gone to his room after
breakfast to see how he was, but he had not been there.
He is probably well enough to go dancing. Light, now I will probably dream about him
dancing with Seanchan! No more dreams, she told herself firmly. Not now. I will think about them
when I am not so tired. She thought of the kitchens, of the midday meal soon to come, and then
supper, and breakfast again tomorrow, and pots and cleaning and scrubbing going on forever. If I am
ever not tired again. Shifting her position on the bed, she looked at her friends again. Elayne still had
her eyes on the list of names. Nynaeve’s steps had slowed. Any moment now, Nynaeve will say it
again. Any moment.
Nynaeve came to a halt, staring down at Elayne. “Put those away. We have been over them
twenty times, and there isn’t a word that helps. Verin gave us rubbish. The question is, was it all she
had, or did she give us rubbish on purpose?”
As expected. Maybe half an hour till she says it again. Egwene frowned down at her hands,
glad she could not see them clearly. The Great Serpent ring looked—out of place—on hands all
wrinkled from long immersion in hot, soapy water.
“Knowing their names helps,” Elayne said, still reading. “Knowing what they look like helps.”
“You know very well what I mean,” Nynaeve snapped.
Egwene sighed and folded her arms in front of her, rested her chin on them. When she had come
out of Sheriam’s study that morning, with the sun still not even a glint on the horizon, Nynaeve had
been waiting with a candle in the cold, dark hall. She had not been seeing very clearly, but she was
sure Nynaeve had looked ready to chew stone. And knowing chewing stones would not change
anything in the next few minutes. That was why she was so irritable. She’s as touchy about her pride
as any man I ever met. But she should not take it out on Elayne and me. Light, if Elayne can stand
it, she should be able to. She isn’t the Wisdom anymore.
Elayne hardly appeared to notice whether Nynaeve was irritable or not. She frowned into the
distance thoughtfully. “Liandrin was the only Red. All the other Ajahs lost two each.”
“Oh, do be quiet, child,” Nynaeve said.
Elayne wiggled her left hand to display her Great Serpent ring, gave Nynaeve a meaningful look,
and went right on. “No two were born in the same city, and no more than two in any one country.
Amico Nagoyin was the youngest, some fifteen years older than Egwene and I. Joiya Byir could be
our great-grandmother’s great-grandmother.”
Egwene did not like it that one of the Black Ajah shared her daughter’s name. Fool girl! People
sometimes have the same name, and you never had a daughter. It wasn’t real!
“And what does that tell us?” Nynaeve’s voice was too calm; she was ready to explode like a
wagon full of fireworks. “What secrets have you found in it that I missed? I am getting old and blind,
after all!”
“It tells us it is all too neat,” Elayne said calmly. “What chance that thirteen women chosen

solely because they were Darkfriends would be so neatly arrayed across age, across nations, across
Ajahs? Shouldn’t there be perhaps three Reds, or four born in Cairhien, or just two the same age, if it
was all chance? They had women to choose from or they could not have chosen so random a pattern.
There are still Black Ajah in the Tower, or elsewhere we don’t know about. It must mean that.”
Nynaeve gave her braid one ferocious tug. “Light! I think you may be right. You did find secrets I
couldn’t. Light, I was hoping they all went with Liandrin.”
“We do not even know that she is their leader,” Elayne said. “She could have been ordered to
. . . to dispose of us.” Her mouth twisted. “I am afraid I can only think of one reason for them to go to
such lengths to spread everything out so, to avoid any pattern except a lack of pattern. I think it means
there is a pattern of some kind to the Black Ajah.”
“If there’s a pattern,” Nynaeve said firmly, “we will find it. Elayne, if watching your mother run
her court taught you to think like this, I’m glad you watched closely.” Elayne’s answering smile made
a dimple in her cheek.
Egwene eyed the older woman carefully. It seemed Nynaeve was finally ready to stop being a
bear with a sore tooth. She raised her head. “Unless they want us to think they’re hiding a pattern, so
we will waste our time hunting for it when there isn’t one. I am not saying there isn’t; I am only saying
we do not know yet. Let’s look for it, but I think we ought to look at other things, too, don’t you?”
“So you finally decided to rouse,” Nynaeve said. “I thought you had gone to sleep.” But she was
still smiling.
“She is right,” Elayne said disgustedly. “I have built a bridge out of straw. Worse than straw.
Wishes. Maybe you are right, too, Nynaeve. What use is this—this rubbish?” She snatched one paper
out of the stack in front of her. “Rianna has black hair with a white streak above her left ear. If I am
close enough to see that, it’s closer than I want to be.” She grabbed another page. “Chesmal Emry is
one of the most talented Healers anyone has seen in years. Light, could you imagine being Healed by
one of the Black Ajah?” A third sheet. “Marillin Gemalphin is fond of cats and goes out of her way to
help injured animals. Cats! Paah!” She scrabbled all the pages together, crumpling them in her fists.
“It is useless rubbish.”
Nynaeve knelt beside her and gently pried her hands from around the papers. “Perhaps, and
perhaps not.” She smoothed the pages carefully on her breast. “You found in them something for us to
look for. Perhaps we will find more, if we are persistent. And there is the other list.” Both her eyes
and Elayne’s darted to Egwene, brown and blue alike frowning worriedly.
Egwene avoided looking at the table where the other sheets lay. She did not want to think about
them, but she could not avoid it. The list of ter’angreal had etched itself into her mind.
Item. A rod of clear crystal, smooth and perfectly clear, one foot long and one inch in diameter.
Use unknown. Last study made by Corianin Nedeal. Item. A figurine of an unclothed woman in
alabaster, one hand tall. Use unknown. Last study made by Corianin Nedeal. Item. A disc, apparently
of simple iron yet untouched by rust, three inches in diameter, finely engraved on both sides with a
tight spiral. Use unknown. Last study made by Corianin Nedeal. Item. Too many items, and more than
half the “use unknowns” last studied by Corianin Nedeal. Thirteen of them, to be exact.
Egwene shivered. It’s getting so I do not even like to think of that number.
The knowns on the list were fewer, not all of any apparent real use, but hardly more comforting,
as she saw it. A wooden carving of a hedgehog, no bigger than the last joint of a man’s thumb. Such a
simple thing, and surely harmless. Any woman who tried to channel through it went to sleep. Half a
day of peaceful, dreamless sleep, but it was too close not to make her skin crawl. Three more had to
do with sleep in some way. It was almost a relief to read of a fluted rod of black stone, a full pace in

length, that produced balefire, with the notation DANGEROUS AND ALM OST IM POSSIBLE TO CONTROL writ so
strong in Verin’s hand that it tore the paper in two places. Egwene still had no idea what balefire
was, but though it surely sounded dangerous if anything ever did, it just as surely had nothing to do
Corianin Nedeal or dreams.
Nynaeve carried the smoothed-out pages to the table and set them down. She hesitated before
spreading the others out and running her finger down one page, then the next. “Here’s one Mat would
enjoy,” she said in a voice much too light and airy. “Item. A carved cluster of six spotted dice, joined
at the corners, less than two inches across. Use unknown, save that channeling through it seems to
suspend chance in some way, or twist it.” She began to read aloud. “ ‘Tossed coins presented the
same face every time, and in one test landed balanced on edge one hundred times in a row. One
thousand tosses of the dice produced five crowns one thousand times.’ ” She gave a forced laugh.
“Mat would love that.”
Egwene sighed and got to her feet, walked stiffly to the fireplace. Elayne scrambled up,
watching as silently as Nynaeve. Pushing her sleeve as far up her arm as it would go, Egwene
reached carefully up the chimney. Her fingers touched wool on the smoke shelf, and she pulled out a
wadded, singed stocking with a hard lump in the toe. She brushed a smear of soot from her arm, then
took the stocking to the table and shook it out. The twisted ring of striped, flecked stone spun across
the tabletop and fell flat atop a page of the ter’angreal list. For a few moments they just stared at it.
“Perhaps,” Nynaeve said finally, “Verin simply missed the fact that so many of them were last
studied by Corianin.” She did not sound as if she really believed it.
Elayne nodded, but doubtfully. “I saw her walking in the rain once, soaking wet, and took a
cloak to her. She was so wrapped up in whatever she was thinking, I do not believe she knew it was
raining until I put the cloak around her shoulders. She could have missed it.”
“Maybe,” Egwene said. “If she did not, she had to know I’d notice as soon as I read the list. I do
not know. Sometimes I think Verin notices more than she lets on. I just do not know.”
“So there’s Verin to suspect,” Elayne sighed. “If she is Black Ajah, then they know exactly what
we are doing. And Alanna.” She gave Egwene an uncertain, sidelong look.
Egwene had told them everything. Except what happened inside the ter’angreal during her
testing; she could not bring herself to talk about that, any more than Nynaeve or Elayne could tell of
their testings. Everything that happened in the testing chamber, what Sheriam had said about the
terrible weakness conferred by the ability to channel, every word Verin had said, whether it seemed
important or not. The one part they had had trouble accepting was Alanna; Aes Sedai just did not do
things like that. No one in her right mind did anything like that, but Aes Sedai least of all.
Egwene glowered at them, almost hearing them say it. “Aes Sedai are not supposed to lie, either,
but Verin and the Mother seem awfully close with what they tell us. There are not supposed to be
Black Ajah.”
“I like Alanna.” Nynaeve tugged her braid, then shrugged. “Oh, very well. Perha—That is, she
did behave oddly.”
“Thank you,” Egwene said, and Nynaeve gave her an acknowledging nod as if she had heard no
sarcasm.
“In any case, the Amyrlin knows of it, and she can keep an eye on Alanna far more easily than
we can.”
“What about Elaida and Sheriam?” Egwene asked.
“I have never been able to like Elaida,” Elayne said, “but I cannot truly believe she is Black
Ajah. And Sheriam? It’s impossible.”

Nynaeve snorted. “It should be impossible for any of them. When we do find them, there is
nothing says they’ll all be women we do not like. But I don’t mean to put suspicion—not this kind of
suspicion!—on any woman. We need more to go on than that they might have seen something they
shouldn’t.” Egwene nodded agreement as quickly as Elayne, and Nynaeve went on: “We will tell the
Amyrlin that much, and put no more weight to it than it deserves. If she ever looks in on us as she said
she would. If you are with us when she comes, Elayne, remember she does not know about you.”
“I am not likely to forget it,” Elayne said fervently. “But we should have some other way to get
word to her. My mother would have planned it better.”
“Not if she could not trust her messengers,” Nynaeve said. “We will wait. Unless you two think
one of us should have a talk with Verin? No one would think that remarkable.”
Elayne hesitated, then gave her head a small shake. Egwene was quicker and more vigorous with
hers; slip of the mind or not, Verin had left out too much to be trusted.
“Good.” Nynaeve sounded more than satisfied. “I am just as pleased we cannot talk to the
Amyrlin when we choose. This way we make our own decisions, act when and as we decide, without
her directing our every step.” Her hand ran down the pages listing stolen ter’angreal as if she were
reading it again, then closed on the striped stone ring. “And the first decision concerns this. It’s the
first thing we have seen that has any real connection to Liandrin and the others.” She frowned at the
ring, then took a deep breath. “I am going to sleep with it tonight.”
Egwene did not hesitate before taking the ring out of Nynaeve’s hand. She wanted to hesitate—
she wanted to keep her hands by her sides—but she did not, and she was pleased. “I am the one they
say might be a Dreamer. I do not know whether that gives me any advantage, but Verin said it’s
dangerous using this. Whichever of us uses it, she needs any advantage she can find.”
Nynaeve gripped her braid and opened her mouth as if to protest. When she finally spoke,
though, it was to say, “Are you sure, Egwene? We do not even know if you are a Dreamer, and I can
channel more strongly than you. I still think I—” Egwene cut her off.
“You can channel more strongly if you are angry. Can you be sure you’ll be angry in a dream?
Will you have time to become angry before you need to channel? Light, we don’t even know that
anyone can channel in a dream. If one of us has to do it—and you are right; it is the only connection
we have—it should be me. Maybe I really am a Dreamer. Besides, Verin did give it to me.”
Nynaeve looked as if she wanted to argue, but at last she gave a grudging nod. “Very well. But
Elayne and I will be there. I do not know what we can do, but if anything goes wrong, perhaps we can
wake you up, or. . . . We will be there.” Elayne nodded, too.
Now that she had their agreement, Egwene felt a queasiness in the pit of her stomach. I talked
them into it. I wish I did not want them to talk me out of it. She became aware of a woman standing
in the doorway, a woman in novice white, with her hair in long braids.
“Did no one ever teach you to knock, Else?” Nynaeve said.
Egwene hid the stone ring inside her fist. She had the strangest feeling that Else had been staring
at it.
“I have a message for you,” Else said calmly. Her eyes studied the table, with all the papers
scattered on it, then the three women around it. “From the Amyrlin.”
Egwene exchanged wondering looks with Nynaeve and Elayne.
“Well, what is it?” Nynaeve demanded.
Else arched an eyebrow in amusement. “The belongings left behind by Liandrin and the others
were put in the third storeroom on the right from the main stairs in the second basement under the
library.” She glanced at the papers on the table again and left, neither hurrying nor moving slowly.

Egwene felt as if she could not breathe. We’re afraid to trust anybody, and the Amyrlin decides
to trust Else Grinwell of all women?
“That fool girl cannot be trusted not to blab to anyone who’ll listen!” Nynaeve started for the
door.
Egwene grabbed up her skirts and darted past her at a run. Her shoes skidded on the tiles of the
gallery, but she caught a glimpse of white vanishing down the nearest ramp and dashed after it. She
must be running, too, to be so far ahead already. Why is she running? The flash of white was
already disappearing down another ramp. Egwene followed.
A woman turned to face her at the foot of the ramp, and Egwene stopped in confusion. Whoever
she was, this was certainly not Else. All in silver and white silk, she sparked feelings Egwene had
never had before. She was taller, more beautiful by far, and the look in her black eyes made Egwene
feel small, scrawny, and none too clean. She can probably channel more of the Power than I can,
too. Light, she is probably smarter than all three of us put together on top of it. It isn’t fair for one
woman to—Abruptly she realized the way her thoughts were going. Her cheeks reddened, and she
gave herself a shake. She had never felt—less—than any other woman before, and she was not about
to start now.
“Bold,” the woman said. “You are bold to go running about so, alone, where so many murders
have been done.” She sounded almost pleased.
Egwene drew herself up and straightened her dress hurriedly, hoping the other woman would not
notice, knowing she did, wishing the woman had not seen her running like a child. Stop that! “Pardon,
but I am looking for a novice who came this way, I think. She has large, dark eyes and dark hair in
braids. She’s plump, and pretty in a way. Did you see which way she went?”
The tall woman looked her up and down in an amused way. Egwene could not be sure, but she
thought the woman might have glanced a moment at the clenched fist by her side, where she still held
the stone ring. “I do not think you will catch up to her. I saw her, and she was running quite fast. I
suspect she is far away from here by now.”
“Aes Sedai,” Egwene began, but she was given no chance to ask which way Else had gone.
Something that might have been anger, or annoyance, flashed through those black eyes.
“I have taken up enough time with you for now. I have more important matters to see to. Leave
me.” She gestured back the way Egwene had come.
So strong was the command in her voice that Egwene turned and was three steps up the ramp
before she realized what she was doing. Bristling, she spun back. Aes Sedai or no, I—
The gallery was empty.
Frowning, she dismissed the nearest doors—no one lived in those rooms, except possibly mice
—and ran down the ramp, peered both ways, followed the curve of the gallery with her eyes all the
way around. She even peered over the rail, down into the small Garden of the Accepted, and studied
the other galleries, higher as well as lower. She saw two Accepted in their banded dresses, one
Faolain and the other a woman she knew by sight if not name. But there was no woman in silver and
white anywhere.

CHAPTER

Behind a Lock

Shaking her head, Egwene walked back to the doors she had dismissed. She had to go
somewhere. Inside the first, the few furnishings were shapeless mounds under dusty cloths, and the air
seemed stale, as if the door had not been opened in some time. She grimaced; there were mouse tracks
in the dust on the floor. But no others. Two more doors, opened hastily, showed the same thing. It was
no surprise. There were many more empty rooms than occupied in the Accepted’s galleries.
When she pulled her head out of the third room, Nynaeve and Elayne were coming down the
ramp behind her with no particular haste.
“Is she hiding?” Nynaeve asked in surprise. “In there?”
“I lost her.” Egwene peered both ways along the curving gallery again. Where did she go? She
did not mean Else.
“If I had thought Else could outrun you,” Elayne said with a smile, “I’d have chased her, too, but
she has always looked too plump for running to me.” Her smile was worried, though.
“We will have to find her later,” Nynaeve said, “and make sure she knows to keep her mouth
shut. How could the Amyrlin trust that girl?”
“I thought I was right on top of her,” Egwene said slowly, “but it was someone else. Nynaeve, I
turned my back for a moment, and she was gone. Not Else—I never even saw her!—the woman I
thought was Else at first. She was just—gone, and I don’t know where.”
Elayne’s breath caught. “One of the Soulless?” She looked around hastily, but the gallery was
still empty except for the three of them.
“Not her,” Egwene said firmly. “She—” I am not going to tell them she made me feel six years
old, with a torn dress, a dirty face, and a runny nose. “She was no Gray Man. She was tall and
striking, with black eyes and black hair. You’d notice her in a crowd of a thousand. I have never seen
her before, but I think she is Aes Sedai. She must be.”
Nynaeve waited, as though for more, then said impatiently, “If you see her again, point her out to
me. If you think there’s cause. We’ve no time to stand here talking. I mean to see what is in that
storeroom before Else has a chance to tell the wrong person about it. Maybe they were careless. Let’s
not give them a chance to correct it, if they were.”
As she fell in beside Nynaeve, with Elayne on the other side, Egwene realized she still had the
stone ring—Corianin Nedeal’s ter’angreal—clutched in her fist. Reluctantly, she tucked it into her
pouch and pulled the drawstrings tight. As long as I don’t go to sleep with the bloody—But that’s
what I am planning, isn’t it?
But that was for tonight, and no use worrying about it now. As they made their way through the
Tower, she kept an eye out for the woman in silver and white. She was not sure why she was relieved
not to see her. I am a grown woman, and quite capable, thank you. Still, she was just as glad that no

one they encountered looked even remotely like her. The more she thought of the woman, the more she
felt there was something—wrong—about her. Light, I am starting to see the Black Ajah under my
bed. Only, maybe they are under the bed.
The library stood a little apart from the tall, thick shaft of the White Tower proper, its pale stone
heavily streaked with blue, and it looked much like crashing waves frozen at their climax. Those
waves loomed as large as a palace in the morning light, and Egwene knew they certainly contained as
many rooms as one, but all those rooms—those below the odd corridors in the upper levels, where
Verin had her chambers—were filled with shelves, and the shelves filled with books, manuscripts,
papers, scrolls, maps, and charts, collected from every nation over the course of three thousand years.
Not even the great libraries in Tear and Cairhien held so many.
The librarians—Brown sisters all—guarded those shelves, and guarded the doors as closely, to
make sure not a scrap of paper left unless they knew who took it and why. But it was not to one of the
guarded entrances that Nynaeve led Egwene and Elayne.
Around the foundations of the library, lying flat to the ground in the shade of tall pecan trees,
were other doors, both large and small. Laborers sometimes needed access to the storerooms beneath,
and the librarians did not approve of sweating men tracking through their preserve. Nynaeve pulled
up one of those, no bigger than the front door of a farmhouse, and motioned the others down a steep
flight of stairs descending into darkness. When she let it down behind them, all light vanished.
Egwene opened herself to saidar—it came so smoothly that she barely realized what she was
doing—and channeled a trickle of the Power that flooded through her. For a moment the mere feel of
that rush surging within her threatened to overwhelm other sensations. A small ball of bluish-white
light appeared, balanced in the air above her hand. She took a deep breath and reminded herself of
why she was walking stiffly. It was a link to the rest of the world. The feel of her linen shift against
her skin returned, of woolen stockings, and her dress. With a small pang of regret, she banished the
desire to pull in more, to let saidar absorb her.
Elayne made a glowing sphere for herself at the same time, and the pair provided more light than
two lanterns would have. “It feels so—wonderful, doesn’t it?” she murmured.
“Be careful,” Egwene said.
“I am.” Elayne sighed. “It just feels. . . . I will be careful.”
“This way,” Nynaeve told them sharply and brushed by to lead them down. She did not go too
far ahead. She was not angry, and had to use the light the other two provided.
The dusty side corridor by which they had entered, lined with wooden doors set in gray stone
walls, took nearly a hundred paces to reach the much wider main hall that ran the length of the library.
Their lights showed footprints overlaying footprints in the dust, most from the large boots men would
wear and most themselves faded by dust. The ceiling was higher here, and some of the doors nearly
large enough for a barn. The main stairs at the end, half the width of the hall, were where large things
were brought down. Another flight beside them led deeper. Nynaeve took it without a pause.
Egwene followed quickly. The bluish light washed out Elayne’s face, but Egwene thought it still
looked paler than it should. We could scream our lungs out down here, and no one would hear a
whimper.
She felt a lightning bolt form, or the potential for one, and nearly stumbled. She had never before
channeled two flows at once; it did not seem difficult at all.
The main hall of the second basement was much like the first level, wide and dusty but with a
lower ceiling. Nynaeve hurried to the third door on the right and stopped.
The door was not large, but its rough wooden planks somehow gave an impression of thickness.

A round iron lock hung from a length of stout chain that was drawn tight through two thick staples, one
in the door, the other cemented into the wall. Lock and chain alike had the look of newness; there was
almost no dust on them.
“A lock!” Nynaeve jerked at it; the chain had no give, and neither did the lock. “Did either of
you see a lock anywhere else?” She pulled it again, then flung it against the door hard enough to
bounce. The bang echoed down the hall. “I did not see one other locked door!” She pounded a fist on
the rough wood. “Not one!”
“Calm yourself,” Elayne said. “There is no need to throw a tantrum. I could open the lock
myself, if I could see how the inside of it works. We will open it some way.”
“I do not want to calm myself,” Nynaeve snapped. “I want to be furious! I want . . . !”
Letting the rest of the tirade fade from her awareness, Egwene touched the chain. She had
learned more things than how to make lightning bolts since leaving Tar Valon. One was an affinity for
metal. That came from Earth, one of the Five Powers few women had much strength in—the other was
Fire—but she had it, and she could feel the chain, feel inside the chain, feel the tiniest bits of the cold
metal, the patterns they made. The Power within her quivered in time to the vibrations of those
patterns.
“Move out of my way, Egwene.”
She looked around and saw Nynaeve wrapped in the glow of saidar and holding a prybar so
close in color to the blue-white of the light that it was nearly invisible. Nynaeve frowned at the chain,
muttered something about leverage, and the prybar was suddenly twice as long.
“Move, Egwene.”
Egwene moved.
Thrusting the end of the prybar through the chain, Nynaeve braced it, then heaved with all her
strength. The chain snapped like thread, Nynaeve gasped and stumbled halfway across the hall in
surprise, and the prybar clattered to the floor. Straightening, Nynaeve stared from the bar to the chain
in amazement. The prybar vanished.
“I think I did something to the chain,” Egwene said. And I wish I knew what.
“You could have said something,” Nynaeve muttered. She pulled the rest of the chain from the
staples and threw open the door. “Well? Are you going to stand there all day?”
The dusty room inside was perhaps ten paces square, but it held only a heap of large bags made
of heavy brown cloth, each stuffed full, tagged, and sealed with the Flame of Tar Valon. Egwene did
not have to count them to know there were thirteen.
She moved her ball of light to the wall and fastened it there; she was not certain how she did it,
but when she took her hand away, the light remained. I keep learning how to do things without
knowing what they are, she thought nervously.
Elayne frowned at her as if considering, then hung her light on the wall, too. Watching, Egwene
thought she saw what it was she had done. She learned it from me, but I just learned it from her. She
shivered.
Nynaeve went straight to tumbling the bags apart and reading the tags. “Rianna. Joiya Byir.
These are what we are after.” She examined the seal on one bag, then broke the wax and unwound the
binding cords. “At least we know no one’s been here before us.”
Egwene chose a bag and broke the seal without reading the name on the tag. She did not really
want to know whose possessions she was searching. When she upended them onto the dusty floor,
they proved to be mainly old clothes and shoes, with a few ripped and crumpled papers of the sort
that might hide under the wardrobe of a woman who was not too assiduous in seeing her rooms

cleaned. “I don’t see anything useful here. A cloak that would not do for rags. A torn half of a map of
some city. Tear, it says in the corner. Three stockings that need darning.” She stuck her finger through
the hole in a velvet slipper that had no mate and waggled it at the others. “This one left no clues
behind.”
“Amico did not leave anything, either,” Elayne said glumly, tossing clothes aside with both
hands. “It might as well be rags. Wait, here’s a book. Whoever bundled these up must have been in a
hurry to toss in a book. Customs and Ceremonies of the Tairen Court. The cover is torn off, but the
librarians will want it anyway.” The librarians certainly would. No one threw away books, no matter
how badly damaged.
“Tear,” Nynaeve said in a flat voice. Kneeling amid the clutter from the bag she was searching,
she retrieved a scrap of paper she had already thrown away. “A list of trading ships on the Erinin,
with the dates they sailed from Tar Valon and the dates they were expected to arrive in Tear.”
“It could be coincidence,” Egwene said slowly.
“Perhaps,” Nynaeve said. She folded the paper and tucked it up her sleeve, then broke the seal
on another bag.
When they finally finished, every bag searched twice and discarded rubbish heaped around the
edges of the room, Egwene sat down on one of the empty bags, so engrossed that she barely noticed
her own wince. Drawing up her knees, she studied the little collection they had made, all laid in a
row.
“It is too much,” Elayne said. “There is too much of it.”
“Too much,” Nynaeve agreed.
There was a second book, a tattered, leather-bound volume entitled Observations on a Visit to
Tear, with half its pages falling out. Caught in the lining of a badly torn cloak in Chesmal Emry’s bag,
where it might have slipped through a rip in one of the pockets of the cloak, had been another list of
trading vessels. It said no more than the names, but they were all on the other list, too, and according
to that, those vessels all had sailed in the early morning after the night Liandrin and the others left the
Tower. There was a hastily sketched plan of some large building, with one room faintly noted as
“Heart of the Stone,” and a page with the names of five inns, the word “Tear” heading the page badly
smudged but barely readable. There was. . . .
“There’s something from everyone,” Egwene muttered. “Every one of them left something
pointing to a journey to Tear. How could anyone miss seeing it, if they looked? Why did the Amyrlin
say nothing of this?”
“The Amyrlin,” Nynaeve said bitterly, “keeps her own counsel, and what matter if we burn for
it!” She drew a deep breath, and sneezed from the dust they had stirred up. “What worries me is that I
am looking at bait.”
“Bait?” Egwene said. But she saw it as soon as she spoke.
Nynaeve nodded. “Bait. A trap. Or maybe a diversion. But trap or diversion, it’s so obvious no
one could be taken in by it.”
“Unless they do not care whether whoever found this saw the trap or not.” Uncertainty tinged
Elayne’s voice. “Or perhaps they meant it to be so obvious that whoever found it would dismiss Tear
immediately.”
Egwene wished she could not believe that the Black Ajah could be as sure of themselves as that.
She realized she was gripping her pouch in her fingers, running her thumb along the twisted curve of
the stone ring inside. “Perhaps they meant to taunt whoever found it,” she said softly. “Perhaps they
thought whoever found this would rush headlong after them, in anger and pride.” Did they know we

would find it? Do they see us that way?
“Burn me!” Nynaeve growled. It was a shock; Nynaeve never used such language.
For a time they simply stared in silence at the array.
“What do we do now?” Elayne asked finally.
Egwene squeezed the ring hard. Dreaming was closely linked to Foretelling; the future, and
events in other places, could appear in a Dreamer’s dreams. “Maybe we will know after tonight.”
Nynaeve looked at her, silent and expressionless, then chose out a dark skirt that seemed not to
have too many holes and rips, and began bundling in it the things they had found. “For now,” she said,
“we will take this back to my room and hide it. I think we just have time, if we don’t want to be late
to the kitchens.”
Late, Egwene thought. The longer she held the ring through her pouch, the greater the urgency she
felt. We’re already a step behind, but maybe we won’t be too late.

CHAPTER
27

Tel’aran’rhiod

The room Egwene had been given, on the same gallery with Nynaeve and Elayne, was little
different from Nynaeve’s. Her bed was a trifle wider, her table a little smaller. Her bit of rug had
flowers instead of scrolls. That was all. After the novices’ quarters, it seemed like a room in a
palace, but when the three of them gathered there late that night, Egwene wished she were back on the
novice galleries, with no ring on her finger and no bands on her dress. The others looked as nervous
as she felt.
They had worked in the kitchens for two more meals, and in between tried to puzzle out the
meaning of what they had found in the storeroom. Was it a trap, or an attempt to divert the search?
Did the Amyrlin know of the things, and if she did, why had she not mentioned them? Talking
provided no answers, and the Amyrlin never appeared so they could ask her.
Verin had come into the kitchens after the midday meal, blinking as if she were not sure why she
was there. When she saw Egwene and the other two on their knees among the cauldrons and kettles,
she looked surprised for a moment, then walked over and asked, loud enough for anyone to hear,
“Have you found anything?”
Elayne, with her head and shoulders inside a huge soup kettle, banged her head on the rim
backing out. Her blue eyes seemed to take up her entire face.
“Nothing but grease and sweat, Aes Sedai,” Nynaeve said. The tug she gave her braid left a
smear of greasy soap suds on her dark hair, and she grimaced.
Verin nodded as if that were the answer she had been seeking. “Well, keep looking.” She peered
around the kitchen again, frowning as though puzzled to find herself there, and left.
Alanna came to the kitchens after midday, too, collecting a bowl of big green gooseberries and a
pitcher of wine, and Elaida, then Sheriam, appeared after supper, and Anaiya, too.
Alanna had asked Egwene if she wanted to know more of the Green Ajah, inquired when they
were going to get on with their studies. Just because the Accepted chose their own lessons and pace
did not mean they were not supposed to do any at all. The first few weeks would be bad, of course,
but they had to choose, or the choosing would be done for them.
Elaida merely stood for a time, stern-faced and staring at them, hands on her hips, and Sheriam
did the same in almost the identical pose. Anaiya stood the same way, but her look was more
concerned. Until she saw them glancing at her. Then her face became a match for Elaida’s and
Sheriam’s before her.
None of those visits meant anything that Egwene could see. The Mistress of Novices certainly
had reason to check on them, as well as on the novices working in the kitchens, and Elaida had reason
to keep an eye on the Daughter-Heir of Andor. Egwene tried not to think of the Aes Sedai’s interest in
Rand. As for Alanna, she was not the only Aes Sedai who came for a tray to take back to her rooms

rather than eat with the others. Half the sisters in the Tower were too busy for meals, too busy to take
the time to summon a servant to fetch a tray. And Anaiya . . . ? Anaiya could well be concerned for
her Dreamer. Not that she would do anything to ease a punishment set by the Amyrlin Seat herself.
That could have been Anaiya’s reason for coming. It could have been.
Hanging her dress in the wardrobe, Egwene told herself once again that even Verin’s slip could
have been perfectly ordinary; the Brown sister was often absentminded. If it was a slip. Sitting on the
edge of her bed, she pulled up her shift and began rolling down her stockings. She was almost
beginning to dislike white as much as she did gray.
Nynaeve stood in front of the fireplace with Egwene’s pouch in one hand, tugging her braid.
Elayne sat by the table, making nervous conversation.
“Green Ajah,” the golden-haired woman said for what Egwene thought must be the twentieth
time since midday. “I might choose Green Ajah myself, Egwene. Then I can have three or four
Warders, perhaps marry one of them. Who better for Prince Consort of Andor than a Warder? Unless
it is. . . .” She trailed off, blushing.
Egwene felt a pang of jealousy she thought she had put down long ago, and sympathy mixed with
it. Light, how can I be jealous when I cannot look at Galad without shivering and feeling as if I am
melting, both at the same time? Rand was mine, but no more. I wish I could give him to you,
Elayne, but he is not for either of us, I think. It may be all well and good for the Daughter-Heir to
marry a commoner, as long as he’s an Andorman, but not to marry the Dragon Reborn. She let the
stockings fall on the floor, telling herself there were more important things to worry about tonight than
neatness. “I am ready, Nynaeve.”
Nynaeve handed her the pouch, and a long, thin strip of leather. “Perhaps it will work for more
than one at once. I could . . . go with you, perhaps.”
Emptying the stone ring onto her palm, Egwene threaded the leather strip through it, then tied it
around her neck. The stripes and flecks of blue and brown and red seemed more vivid against the
white of her shift. “And leave Elayne to watch over the both of us alone? When the Black Ajah may
know us?”
“I can do it,” Elayne said stoutly. “Or let me go with you, and Nynaeve can keep guard. She is
the strongest of us, when she’s angry, and if there is need for a guard, you can be sure she will be.”
Egwene shook her head. “What if it won’t work for two? What if two of us trying makes it not
work at all? We would not even know till we woke up, and then we’ve wasted the night. We cannot
waste even one if we are to catch up. We’re too far behind them already.” They were valid reasons,
and she believed them, but there was another, closer to her heart. “Besides, I’ll feel better knowing
both of you are watching over me, in case. . . .”
She did not want to say it. In case someone came while she was asleep. The Gray Men. The
Black Ajah. Any one of the things that had turned the White Tower from a place of safety to a dark
woods full of pits and snares. Something coming in while she lay there helpless. Their faces showed
they understood.
As she stretched herself out on the bed and plumped a feather pillow behind her head, Elayne
moved the chairs, one to either side of the bed. Nynaeve snuffed the candles one by one, then, in the
dark, sat in one of the chairs. Elayne took the other.
Egwene closed her eyes and tried to think sleepy thoughts, but she was too conscious of the thing
lying between her breasts. Far more conscious than of any soreness remaining from her visit to
Sheriam’s study. The ring seemed to weigh as much as a brick, now, and thoughts of home and quiet
pools of water all slid apart with remembrance of it. Of Tel’aran’rhiod. The Unseen World. The

World of Dreams. Waiting just the other side of sleep.
Nynaeve began to hum softly. Egwene recognized a nameless, wordless tune her mother used to
hum to her when she was little. When she was lying in bed, in her own room, with a fluffy pillow, and
warm blankets, and the mingled smells of rose oil and baking from her mother, and. . . . Rand, are
you all right? Perrin? Who was she? Sleep came.
She stood among rolling hills quilted with wildflowers and dotted with small thickets of leafy
trees in the hollows and on the crests. Butterflies floated above the blossoms, wings flashing yellow
and blue and green, and two larks sang to each other nearby. Just enough fluffy white clouds drifted in
a soft blue sky, and the breeze held that delicate balance between cool and warm that came only a few
special days in spring. It was a day too perfect to be anything but a dream.
She looked at her dress, and laughed delightedly. Exactly her favorite shade of sky-blue silk,
slashed with white in the skirt—that changed to green as she frowned momentarily—sewn with rows
of tiny pearls down the sleeves and across the bosom. She stuck out a foot just to peek at the toe of a
velvet slipper. The only jarring note was the twisted ring of multicolored stone hanging around her
neck on a leather cord.
She took the ring in her hand and gasped. It felt as light as a feather. If she tossed it up, she was
sure it would drift away like thistledown. Somehow, she did not feel afraid of it any longer. She
tucked it inside the neck of her dress to get it out of the way.
“So this is Verin’s Tel’aran’rhiod,” she said. “Corianin Nedeal’s World of Dreams. It does not
look dangerous to me.” But Verin had said it was. Black Ajah or not, Egwene did not see how any
Aes Sedai could tell a lie right out. She could be mistaken. But she did not believe Verin was.
Just to see if she could, she opened herself to the One Power. Saidar filled her. Even here, it
was present. She channeled the flow lightly, delicately, directed it into the breeze, swirling butterflies
into fluttering spirals of color, into circles linked with circles.
Abruptly she let it go. The butterflies settled back, unconcerned by their brief adventure.
Myrddraal and some other Shadowspawn could sense someone channeling. Looking around, she
could not imagine such things in that place, but just because she could not imagine them did not mean
they were not there. And the Black Ajah had all those ter’angreal studied by Corianin Nedeal. It was
a sickening reminder of why she was there.
“At least I know I can channel,” she muttered. “I’m not learning anything standing here. Perhaps
if I look around. . . .” She took a step . . .
. . . and was standing in the dank, dark hallway of an inn. She was an innkeeper’s daughter; she
was sure it was an inn. There was not a sound, and all the doors along the hall were shut tight. Just as
she wondered who was behind the plain wooden door in front of her, it swung silently open.
The room within was bare, and cold wind moaned through open windows, stirring old ash on the
hearth. A big dog lay curled up on the floor, shaggy tail across its nose, between the door and a thick
pillar of rough-cut, black stone that stood in the middle of the floor. A large, shaggy-haired young man
sat leaning back against the pillar in only his smallclothes, head lolling as if asleep. A massive black
chain ran around the pillar and across his chest, the ends gripped in his clenched hands. Asleep or
not, his heavy muscles strained to hold that chain tight, to prison himself against the pillar.
“Perrin?” she said wonderingly. She stepped into the room. “Perrin, what’s the matter with you?
Perrin!” The dog uncurled itself and stood.
It was not a dog, but a wolf, all black and gray, lips curling back from glistening white teeth,
yellow eyes regarding her as they might have a mouse. A mouse it meant to eat.

Egwene stepped back hastily into the hall in spite of herself. “Perrin! Wake up! There’s a wolf!”
Verin had said what happened here was real, and showed the scar to prove it. The wolf’s teeth
looked as big as knives. “Perrin, wake up! Tell it I’m a friend!” She embraced saidar. The wolf
stalked nearer.
Perrin’s head came up; his eyes opened drowsily. Two sets of yellow eyes regarded her. The
wolf gathered himself. “Hopper,” Perrin shouted, “no! Egwene!”
The door swung shut before her face, and total darkness enveloped her.
She could not see, but she felt sweat beading on her forehead. Not from heat. Light, where am I?
I don’t like this place. I want to wake up!
A whirring sound, and she jumped before she recognized a cricket. A frog gave a bass croak in
the darkness, and a chorus answered it. As her eyes adapted, she dimly made out trees all around her.
Clouds blanketed the stars, and the moon was a thin sliver.
Off to her right through the woods was another glow, flickering. A campfire.
She considered a moment before moving. Wanting to wake up had not been enough to take her
way from Tel’aran’rhiod, and she still had not found out anything useful. And she had not been hurt in
any way. So far, she thought, shivering. But she had no idea who—or what—was at that campfire. It
could be Myrddraal. Besides, I’m not dressed for running around in the forest. It was the last
thought that decided her; she prided herself on knowing when she was being foolish.
Taking a deep breath, she gathered up her silken skirts and crept closer. She might not have
Nynaeve’s skill at woodcraft, but she knew enough to avoid stepping on dead twigs. At last she
peered carefully around the trunk of an old oak at the campfire.
The only one there was a tall young man, sitting and staring into the flames. Rand. Those flames
did not burn wood. They did not burn anything that she could see. The fire danced above a bare patch
of ground. She did not think they even scorched the soil.
Before she could move, Rand raised his head. She was surprised to see he was smoking a pipe,
a thin ribbon of tabac smoke lifting from the bowl. He looked tired, so very tired.
“Who’s out there?” he demanded loudly. “You’ve rustled enough leaves to wake the dead, so
you might as well show yourself.”
Egwene’s lips compressed, but she stepped out. I did not! “It’s me, Rand. Do not be afraid. It is
a dream. I must be in your dreams.”
He was on his feet so suddenly that she stopped dead. He seemed in some way larger than she
remembered. And a touch dangerous. Perhaps more than a touch. His blue-gray eyes seemed to burn
like frozen fire.
“Do you think I don’t know it is a dream?” he sneered. “I know that makes it no less real.” He
stared angrily out into the darkness as if looking for someone. “How long will you try?” he shouted at
the night. “How many faces will you send? My mother, my father, now her! Pretty girls won’t tempt
me with a kiss, not even one I know! I deny you, Father of Lies! I deny you!”
“Rand,” she said uncertainly. “It’s Egwene. I am Egwene.”
There was a sword in his hands, suddenly, out of nowhere. Its blade was worked out of a single
flame, slightly curved and graven with a heron. “My mother gave me honeycake,” he said in a tight
voice, “with the smell of poison rank on it. My father had a knife for my ribs. She—she offered
kisses, and more.” Sweat slicked his face; his stare seemed enough to set her afire. “What do you
bring?”
“You are going to listen to me, Rand al’Thor, if I have to sit on you.” She gathered saidar,
channeled the flows to make the air hold him in a net.

The sword spun in his hands, roaring like an open furnace.
She grunted and staggered; it felt as if a rope stretched too tight had broken and snapped back
into her.
Rand laughed. “I learn, you see. When it works. . . .” He grimaced and started toward her. “I
could stand any face but that one. Not her face, burn you!” The sword flashed out.
Egwene fled.
She was not sure what it was she did, or how, but she found herself back among the rolling hills
under a sunny sky, with larks singing and butterflies playing. She drew a deep, shuddering breath.
I’ve learned. . . . What? That the Dark One is still after Rand? I knew that already. That
maybe the Dark One wants to kill him? That’s different. Unless maybe he’s gone mad already, and
does not know what he is saying. Light, why couldn’t I help him? Oh, Light, Rand!
She took another long breath to calm herself. “The only way to help him is to gentle him,” she
muttered. “As well go ahead and kill him.” Her stomach twisted and knotted. “I’ll never do that.
Never!”
A redbird had perched on a cloudberry bush nearby, crest lifting as it tilted its head to watch her
cautiously. She addressed the bird. “Well, I am not helping anything standing here talking to myself,
am I? Or talking to you, either.”
The redbird took wing as she stepped toward the bush. It was still a flash of crimson as she took
the next step, vanished into a thicket as she took a third.
She stopped and fished the stone ring on its cord out of the front of her dress. Why was it not
changing? Everything had changed so fast up till now that she could hardly catch her breath. Why not
now? Unless there was some answer right here? She looked around uncertainly. The wildflowers
taunted her, and the larksong mocked her. This place seemed too much of her own making.
Determined, she tightened her hand around the ter’angreal. “Take me where I need to be.” She
shut her eyes and concentrated on the ring. It was stone, after all; Earth should give her some feeling
for it. “Do it. Take me where I need to be.” Once again she embraced saidar, fed a trickle of the One
Power into the ring. She knew it did not need any flow of Power directed at it to work, and she did
not try to do anything to it. Only to give it more of the Power to use. “Take me to where I can find an
answer. I need to know what the Black Ajah wants. Take me to the answer.”
“Well, you’ve found your way at last, child. All sorts of answers here.”
Egwene’s eyes snapped open. She stood in a great hall, its vast domed ceiling supported by a
forest of massive redstone columns. And hanging in midair was a sword of crystal, gleaming and
sparkling as it slowly revolved. She was not certain, but she thought it might be the sword Rand had
been reaching for in that dream. That other dream. This all felt so real, she had to keep reminding
herself it was a dream, too.
An old woman stepped out of the shadows of the column, bent and hobbling with a stick. Ugly
did not begin to describe her. She had a bony, pointed chin, an even bonier, sharper nose, and it
seemed there were more warts growing hairs on her face than there was face.
“Who are you?” Egwene said. The only people she had seen so far in Tel’aran’rhiod were those
she already knew, but she did not think she could have forgotten this poor old woman.
“Just poor old Silvie, my Lady,” the old woman cackled. At the same time she managed a stoop
that might have been meant for a curtsy, or possibly a cringe. “You know poor old Silvie, my Lady.
Served your family faithfully all these years. Does this old face still frighten you? Don’t let it, my
Lady. It serves me, when I need it, as good as a prettier.”
“Of course, it does,” Egwene said. “It’s a strong face. A good face.” She hoped the woman

believed it. Whoever this Silvie was, she seemed to think she knew Egwene. Perhaps she knew
answers, too. “Silvie, you said something about finding answers here.”
“Oh, you’ve come to the right place for answers, my Lady. The Heart of the Stone is full of
answers. And secrets. The High Lords would not be pleased to see us here, my Lady. Oh, no. None
but the High Lords enter here. And servants, of course.” She gave a sly, screeching laugh. “The High
Lords don’t sweep and mop. But who sees a servant?”
“What kind of secrets?”
But Silvie was hobbling toward the crystal sword. “Plots,” she said as if to herself. “All of them
pretending to serve the Great Lord, and all the while plotting and planning to regain what they lost.
Each one thinking he or she is the only one plotting. Ishamael is a fool!”
“What?” Egwene said sharply. “What did you say about Ishamael?”
The old woman turned to present a crooked, ingratiating smile. “Just a thing poor folks say, my
Lady. It turns the Forsaken’s power, calling them fools. Makes you feel good, and safe. Even the
Shadow can’t take being called a fool. Try it, my Lady. Say, Ba’alzamon is a fool!”
Egwene’s lips twitched on the edge of a smile. “Ba’alzamon is a fool! You are right, Silvie.” It
actually did feel good, laughing at the Dark One. The old woman chuckled. The sword revolved just
beyond her shoulder. “Silvie, what is that?”
“Callandor, my Lady. You know that, don’t you? The Sword That Cannot Be Touched.”
Abruptly she swung her stick behind her; a foot from the sword, the stick stopped with a dull thwack
and bounded back. Silvie grinned wider. “The Sword That Is Not a Sword, though there’s precious
few knows what it is. But none can touch it save one. They saw to that, who put it here. The Dragon
Reborn will hold Callandor one day, and prove to the world he’s the Dragon by doing it. The first
proof, anyway. Lews Therin come back for all the world to see, and grovel before. Ah, the High
Lords don’t like having it here. They like nothing to do with the Power. They’d rid themselves of it, if
they could. If they could. I suppose there’s others would take it, if they could. What wouldn’t one of
the Forsaken give, to hold Callandor?”
Egwene stared at the sparkling sword. If the Prophecies of the Dragon were true, if Rand was
the Dragon as Moiraine claimed, he would wield it one day, though from the rest of what she knew of
the Prophecies concerning Callandor, she could not see how it could ever come to be. But if there’s
a way to take it, maybe the Black Ajah knows how. If they know it, I can figure it out.
Cautiously, she reached out with the Power, probing at whatever held and shielded the sword.
Her probe touched—something—and stopped. She could sense which of the Five Powers had been
used here. Air, and Fire, and Spirit. She could trace the intricate weave made by saidar, set with a
strength that amazed her. There were gaps in that weave, spaces where her probe should slide
through. When she tried, it was like fighting the strongest part of the weave head on. It hit her then,
what she was trying to force a way through, and she let her probe vanish. Half that wall had been
woven using saidar; the other half, the part she could not sense or touch, had been made with saidin.
That was not it, exactly—the wall was all of one piece—but it was close enough. A stone wall stops
a blind woman as surely as one who can see it.
Footsteps echoed in the distance. Boots.
Egwene could not tell how many there were, or from which direction they were coming, but
Silvie gave a start and immediately stared off among the columns. “He’s coming to stare at it again,”
she muttered. “Awake or asleep, he wants. . . .” She seemed to remember Egwene, and put on a
worried smile. “You must leave, now, my Lady. He mustn’t find you here, or even know you’ve
been.”

Egwene was already backing in among the columns, and Silvie followed, flapping her hands and
waving her stick. “I am going, Silvie. I just have to remember the way.” She fingered the stone ring.
“Take me back to the hills.” Nothing happened. She channeled a hairlike flow to the ring. “Take me
back to the hills.” The redstone columns still surrounded her. The boots were closer, close enough not
to be swallowed in their own echoes anymore.
“You don’t know the way out,” Sylvie said flatly, then went on in a near whisper, ingratiating
and mocking at once, an old retainer who felt she could take liberties. “Oh, my Lady, this is a
dangerous place to come into, if you don’t know the way out. Come, let poor old Silvie take you out.
Poor old Silvie will tuck you safe in your bed, my Lady.” She wrapped both arms around Egwene,
urging her further from the sword. Not that Egwene needed much urging. The boots had stopped; he—
whoever he was—was probably gazing at Callandor.
“Just show me the way,” Egwene whispered back. “Or tell me. There’s no need to push.” The
old woman’s fingers had somehow gotten tangled around the stone ring. “Don’t touch that, Silvie.”
“Safe in your bed.”
Pain annihilated the world.
With a throat-wrenching shriek, Egwene sat up in the dark, sweat rolling down her face. For a
moment she had no idea where she was, and did not care. “Oh, Light,” she moaned, “that hurt. Oh,
Light, that hurt!” She ran her hands over herself, sure her skin must be scored or wealed to make such
a burning, but she could not find a mark.
“We are here,” Nynaeve’s voice said from the darkness. “We’re here, Egwene.”
Egwene threw herself toward the voice and wrapped her arms around Nynaeve’s neck in sheer
relief. “Oh, Light, I’m back. Light, I’m back.”
“Elayne,” Nynaeve said.
In a few moments one of the candles was giving a small light. Elayne paused with the candle in
hand and the spill she had lit with flint and steel in the other. Then she smiled, and every candle in the
room burst into flame. She stopped at the washstand and came back to the bed with a cool, damp cloth
to wash Egwene’s face.
“Was it bad?” she asked worriedly. “You never stirred. You never mumbled. We did not know
whether to wake you or not.”
Hurriedly, Egwene fumbled the leather cord from around her neck and hurled it and the stone
ring across the room. “Next time,” she panted, “we decide on a time, and you wake me after it. Wake
me if you have to stick my head in a basin of water!” She had not realized that she had decided there
would be a next time. Would you put your head in a bear’s mouth just to show you weren’t afraid?
Would you do it twice just because you’d done it once and didn’t die?
Yet it was more than a matter of proving to herself that she was not afraid. She was afraid, and
knew it. But so long as the Black Ajah had those ter’angreal Corianin had studied, she would have to
keep going back. She was sure the answer to why they wanted them lay in Tel’aran’rhiod. If she
could find answers about the Black Ajah there—perhaps other answers, too, if half what she had been
told about Dreaming were true—she had to go back. “But not tonight,” she said softly. “Not yet.”
“What happened?” Nynaeve asked. “What did you . . . dream?”
Egwene lay back on the bed and told them. Of it all, the only thing she left out was about Perrin
talking to the wolf. She left the wolf out altogether. She felt a little guilty about keeping secrets from
Elayne and Nynaeve, but it was Perrin’s secret to tell, when and if he chose, not hers. The rest she
gave them word for word, describing everything. When she was done, she felt emptied.

“Aside from being tired,” Elayne said, “did he look hurt? Egwene, I cannot believe he would
ever hurt you. I cannot believe he would.”
“Rand,” Nynaeve said dryly, “will have to look after himself awhile longer.” Elayne blushed;
she looked pretty doing it. Egwene realized that Elayne looked pretty doing anything, even crying, or
scrubbing pots. “Callandor,” Nynaeve continued. “The Heart of the Stone. That was marked on the
plan. I think we know where the Black Ajah is.”
Elayne had regained her poise. “It does not change the trap,” she said. “If it is not a diversion, it
is a trap.”
Nynaeve smiled grimly. “The best way to catch whoever set a trap is to spring it and wait for
him to come. Or her, in this instance.”
“You mean go to Tear?” Egwene said, and Nynaeve nodded.
“The Amyrlin has cut us loose, it seems. We make our own decisions, remember? At least we
know the Black Ajah is in Tear, and we know who to look for there. Here, all we can do is sit and
stew in our own suspicions of everybody, wonder if there is another Gray Man out there. I would
rather be the hound than the rabbit.”
“I have to write to my mother,” Elayne said. When she saw the looks they gave her, her voice
became defensive. “I have already vanished once without her knowing where I was. If I do it again.
. . . You do not know Mother’s temper. She could send Gareth Bryne and the whole army against Tar
Valon. Or hunting after us.”
“You could stay here,” Egwene said.
“No. I will not let you two go alone. And I won’t stay here wondering if the sister teaching me is
a Darkfriend, or if the next Gray Man will come after me.” She gave a small laugh. “I will not work
in the kitchens while you two are off adventuring, either. I just have to tell my mother than I am out of
the Tower on the Amyrlin’s orders, so she won’t become furious if she hears rumors. I do not have to
tell her where we are going, or why.”
“You surely had better not,” Nynaeve said. “She very likely would come after you if she knew
about the Black Ajah. For that matter, you can’t know how many hands your letter will pass through
before it reaches her, or what eyes might read it. Best not to say anything you don’t mind anyone
knowing.”
“That’s another thing.” Elayne sighed. “The Amyrlin does not know I am one of you. I have to
find some way to send it with no chance of her seeing it.”
“I will have to think on that.” Nynaeve’s brows furrowed. “Perhaps once we’re on our way. You
could leave it at Aringill on the way downriver, if we have time to find someone there going to
Caemlyn. A sight of one of those papers the Amyrlin gave us might convince somebody. We will have
to hope they work on ship captains, too, unless one of you has more coin than I have.” Elayne shook
her head dolefully.
Egwene did not even bother. What money they had possessed had all gone on the journey from
Toman Head, except for a few coppers each. “When. . . .” She had to stop and clear her throat. “When
do we leave? Tonight?”
Nynaeve looked as if she were considering it for a moment, but then she shook her head. “You
need sleep, after. . . .” Her gesture took in the stone ring lying where it had bounced off the wall. “We
will give the Amyrlin one more chance to seek us out. When we finish with breakfast, you both pack
what you want to take, but keep it light. We have to leave the Tower without anyone noticing,
remember. If the Amyrlin doesn’t reach us by midday, I mean to be on a trading ship, shoving that
paper down the captain’s throat if need be, before Prime sounds. How does that sound to you two?”

“It sounds excellent,” Elayne said firmly, and Egwene said, “Tonight or tomorrow, the sooner
the better, as far as I can see.” She wished she sounded as confident as Elayne.
“Then we had best get some sleep.”
“Nynaeve,” Egwene said in a small voice, “I. . . . I don’t want to be alone tonight.” It pained her
to make that admission.
“I don’t, either,” Elayne said. “I keep thinking about the Soulless. I do not know why, but they
frighten me even more than the Black Ajah.”
“I suppose,” Nynaeve said slowly, “I don’t really want to be alone, myself.” She eyed the bed
where Egwene lay. “That looks big enough for three, if everybody keeps her elbows to herself.”
Later, when they were shifting about trying to find a way to lie that did not feel so crowded,
Nynaeve suddenly laughed.
“What is it?” Egwene asked. “You are not that ticklish.”
“I just thought of someone who’d be happy to carry Elayne’s letter for her. Happy to leave Tar
Valon, too. In fact, I’d bet on it.”

CHAPTER
28

A Way Out

Clad only in his breeches, Mat was just finishing a snack after breakfast—some ham, three
apples, bread, and butter—when the door of his room opened, and Nynaeve, Egwene, and Elayne
filed in, all smiling at him brightly. He got up for a shirt, then stubbornly sat down again. They could
at least have knocked. In any case, it was good to see their faces. At first, it was.
“Well, you do look better,” Egwene said.
“As if you had had a month of good food and rest,” Elayne said.
Nynaeve pressed a hand to his forehead. He flinched before he recalled that she had done much
the same for at least five years, back home. She was just the Wisdom then, he thought. She wasn’t
wearing that ring.
She had noticed his flinch. She gave him a tight smile. “You look ready to be up and about, to
me. Are you tired of being cooped up, yet? You never could stand two days in a row indoors.”
He eyed the last apple core reluctantly, then dropped it back on the plate. Almost, he started to
lick the juice off his fingers, but they were all three looking at him. And still smiling. He realized he
was trying to decide which of them was prettiest, and could not. Had they been anybody but who—
and what—they were, he would have asked any and all of them to dance a jig or a reel. He had
danced with Egwene often enough, back home, and even once with Nynaeve, but that seemed a long
time ago.
“ ‘One pretty woman means fun at the dance. Two pretty women mean trouble in the house.
Three pretty women mean run for the hills.’ ” He gave Nynaeve an even tighter smile than her own.
“My da used to say that. You’re up to something, Nynaeve. You are all smiling like cats staring at a
finch caught in a thornbush, and I think I am the finch.”
The smiles flickered and vanished. He noticed their hands and wondered why they all looked as
if they had been washing dishes. The Daughter-Heir of Andor surely never washed a dish, and he had
as hard a time imagining Nynaeve at it, even knowing she had done her own back in Emond’s Field.
They all three wore Great Serpent rings, now. That was new. And not a particularly pleasant
surprise. Light, it had to happen sometime. It’s none of my business, and that is all there is to it.
None of my business. It just isn’t.
Egwene shook her head, but it seemed as much for the other two women as for him. “I told you
we should ask him straight out. He’s stubborn as any mule when he wants to be, and tricksome as a
cat. You are, Mat. You know it, so stop frowning.”
He put his grin back quickly.
“Hush, Egwene,” Nynaeve said. “Mat, just because we want to ask you a favor does not mean
we don’t care how you feel. We do care, and you know that, unless you’re being even more woolheaded than usual. Are you well? You look remarkably well compared to how I last saw you. It really

does look more like a month than two days.”
“I’m ready to run ten miles and dance a jig at the end of it.” His stomach growled, reminding him
how long it was to midday yet, but he ignored it, and hoped they had not noticed. He almost did feel
as if he had had a month of rest and food. And had had one meal in the last day. “What favor?” he
asked suspiciously. Nynaeve did not ask favors, in his recollection; Nynaeve told people what to do
and expected to see it done.
“I want you to carry a letter for me,” Elayne said before Nynaeve could speak. “To my mother,
in Caemlyn.” She smiled, making a dimple in her cheek. “I would appreciate it so very much, Mat.”
The morning light through the windows seemed to pick out highlights in her hair.
I wonder if she likes to dance. He pushed the thought right out of his head. “That does not sound
too very hard, but it’s a long trip. What do I get out of it?” From the look on her face, he did not think
that dimple had failed her very often.
She drew herself up, slim and proud. He could almost see a throne behind her. “Are you a loyal
subject of Andor? Do you not wish to serve the Lion Throne, and your Daughter-Heir?”
Mat snickered.
“I told you that would not work either,” Egwene said. “Not with him.”
Elayne had a wry twist to her mouth. “I thought it worth a try. It always works on the Guards, in
Caemlyn. You said if I smiled—” She cut off short, very obviously not looking at him.
What did you say, Egwene, he thought, furious. That I’m a fool for any girl who smiles at me?
He kept his outward calm, though, and managed to maintain his grin.
“I wish asking were enough,” Egwene said, “but you do not do favors, do you, Mat? Have you
ever done anything without being coaxed, wheedled, or bullied?”
He only smiled at her. “I will dance with both of you, Egwene, but I won’t run errands.” For an
instant he thought she was going to stick out her tongue at him.
“If we can go back to what we planned in the first place,” Nynaeve said in a too-calm voice.
The other two nodded, and she turned her attentions on him. For the first time since coming in, she
looked like the Wisdom of old, with a stare that could pin you in your tracks and her braid ready to
lash like a cat’s tail.
“You are even ruder than I remembered, Matrim Cauthon. With you sick so long—and Egwene,
and Elayne, and I taking care of you like a babe in swaddling—I had almost forgotten. Even so, I
would think you’d have a little gratitude in you. You’ve talked about seeing the world, seeing great
cities. Well, what better city than Caemlyn? Do what you want, show your gratitude, and help
someone all at the same time.” She produced a folded parchment from inside her cloak and set it on
the table. It was sealed with a lily, in golden yellow wax. “You cannot ask for more than that.”
He eyed the paper regretfully. He barely remembered passing through Caemlyn, once, with
Rand. It was a shame to stop them now, but he thought it best. If you want the fun of the jig, you have
to pay the harper sooner or later. And the way Nynaeve was now, the longer he kept from paying,
the worse it would be. “Nynaeve, I can’t.”
“What do you mean, you cannot? Are you a fly on the wall, or a man? A chance to do a favor for
the Daughter-Heir of Andor, to see Caemlyn, to meet Queen Morgase herself in all probability, and
you cannot? I really do not know what more you could possibly want. Don’t you skitter away like
grease on a griddle this time, Matrim Cauthon! Or has your heart changed so you like seeing these all
around you?” She waved her left hand in his face, practically hitting him in the nose with her ring.
“Please, Mat?” Elayne said, and Egwene was staring at him as if he had grown horns like a
Trolloc.

He squirmed on his chair. “It is not that I don’t want to. I cannot! The Amyrlin’s made it so I
can’t get off the bloo—the island. Change that, and I will carry your letter in my teeth, Elayne.”
Looks passed between them. He sometimes wondered if women could read each other’s minds.
They certainly seemed to read his when he least wanted it. But this time, whatever they had decided
silently among themselves, they had not read his thoughts.
“Explain,” Nynaeve said curtly. “Why would the Amyrlin want to keep you here?”
He shrugged, and looked her straight in the eye, and gave her his best rueful grin. “It’s because I
was sick. Because it went on so long. She said she would not let me go until she was sure I wouldn’t
go off somewhere and die. Not that I’m going to, of course. Die, I mean.”
Nynaeve frowned, and jerked her braid, and suddenly took his head between her hands; a chill
ran through him. Light, the Power! Before the thought was done, she had released him.
“What . . . ? What did you do to me, Nynaeve?”
“Not a tenth part of what you deserve, in all likelihood,” she said. “You are as healthy as a bull.
Weaker than you look, but healthy.”
“I told you I was,” he said uneasily. He tried to get his grin back. “Nynaeve, she looked like you.
The Amyrlin, I mean. Managing to loom even if she is a foot too short for it, and bullying. . . .” The
way her eyebrows climbed, he decided that was not a road to go down any further. As long as he kept
them away from the Horn. He wondered if they knew. “Well. Anyway, I think they want to keep me
here because of that dagger. I mean, until they figure out exactly how it did what it did. You know
how Aes Sedai are.” He gave a small laugh. They all just looked at him. Maybe I shouldn’t have
said that. Burn me! They want to be bloody Aes Sedai. Burn me, I’m going on too long. I wish
Nynaeve would stop staring at me like that. Keep it short. “The Amyrlin made it so I cannot cross a
bridge or board a ship without an order from her. You see? It’s not that I do not want to help. I just
can’t.”
“But you will if we can get you out of Tar Valon?” Nynaeve said intently.
“You get me out of Tar Valon, and I’ll carry Elayne to her mother on my back.”
Elayne’s eyebrows went up, this time, and Egwene shook her head, mouthing his name with a
sharp look in her eyes. Women had no sense of humor, sometimes.
Nynaeve motioned the two of them to follow her to the windows, where they turned their backs
to him and talked so softly he could catch only a murmur. He thought he heard Egwene say something
about only needing one if they stayed together. Watching, he wondered if they really thought they
could get around the Amyrlin’s order. If they can do that, I will carry their bloody letter. I really
will carry it in my teeth.
Without thinking, he picked up an apple core and bit off the end. One chew, and he hastily spit
the mouthful of bitter seeds back onto the plate.
When they came back to the table, Egwene handed him a thick, folded paper. He eyed them
suspiciously before opening it out. As he read, he began humming to himself without knowing it.
What the bearer does is done at my order and by my authority. Obey, and keep silent, at my
command.
Siuan Sanche
Watcher of the Seals
Flame of Tar Valon
The Amyrlin Seat
And sealed at the bottom with the Flame of Tar Valon in a circle of white wax as hard as stone.

He realized he was humming “A Pocket Full of Gold” and stopped. “Is this real? You didn’t . . .
? How did you get this?”
“She did not forge it, if that is what you mean,” Elayne said.
“Never you mind how we got it,” Nynaeve said. “It is real. That is all that need concern you. I
would not show it around, were I you, or the Amyrlin will take it back, but it will get you past the
guards and onto a ship. You said you’d take the letter, if we did that.”
“You can consider it in Morgase’s hands right now.” He did not want to stop reading the paper,
but he folded it back up anyway, and laid it on top of Elayne’s letter. “You wouldn’t happen to have a
little coin to go with this, would you? Some silver? A gold mark or two? I have almost enough for my
passage, but I hear things are growing expensive downriver.”
Nynaeve shook her head. “Don’t you have money? You gambled with Hurin almost every night
until you grew too sick to hold the dice. Why should things be more expensive downriver?”
“We gambled for coppers, Nynaeve, and he would not even do that after a while. It doesn’t
matter. I will manage. Don’t you listen to what people say? There’s civil war in Cairhien, and I hear
it is bad in Tear, too. I’ve heard a room at an inn in Aringill costs more than a good horse back
home.”
“We have been busy,” she said sharply, and exchanged worried looks with Egwene and Elayne
that set him wondering again.
“It doesn’t matter. I can make out.” There had to be gaming in the inns near the docks. A night
with the dice would put him aboard a ship in the morning with a full purse.
“Just you deliver that letter to Queen Morgase, Mat,” Nynaeve said. “And do not let anyone
know you have it.”
“I’ll take it to her. I said I would, didn’t I? You would think I didn’t keep my promises.” The
looks he got from Nynaeve and Egwene reminded him of a few he had not kept. “I will do it. Blood
and—I will do it!”
They stayed awhile longer, talking of home for the most part. Egwene and Elayne sat on the bed,
and Nynaeve took the armchair, while he kept his stool. Talk of Emond’s Field made him homesick,
and it seemed to make Nynaeve and Egwene sad, as if they were speaking of something they would
never see again. He was sure their eyes moistened, but when he tried to change the subject, they
brought it back again, to people they knew, to the festivals of Bel Tine and Sunday, to harvest dances
and picnic gatherings for the shearing.
Elayne talked to him of Caemlyn, of what to expect at the Royal Palace and who to speak to, and
a little of the city. Sometimes she held herself in a way that made him all but see a crown on her head.
A man would have to be a fool to let himself get involved with a woman like her. When they rose to
leave, he was sorry to see them go.
He stood, suddenly feeling awkward. “Look, you have done me a favor here.” He touched the
Amyrlin’s paper, on the table. “A big favor. I know you’re all going to be Aes Sedai”—he stumbled a
little on that—“and you will be a queen one day, Elayne, but if you ever need help, if there is ever
anything I can do, I will come. You can count on it. Did I say something funny?”
Elayne had a hand over her mouth, and Egwene was struggling openly with a laugh. “No, Mat,”
Nynaeve said smoothly, but her lips twitched. “Just something I have observed about men.”
“You would have to be a woman to understand,” Elayne said.
“Journey well and safely, Mat,” Egwene said. “And remember, if a woman does need a hero,
she needs him today, not tomorrow.” The laughter bubbled out of her.
He stared at the door closing behind them. Women, he decided for at least the hundredth time,

were odd.
Then his eye fell on Elayne’s letter, and the folded paper lying atop it. The Amyrlin’s blessed,
not-to-be-understood, but welcome-as-a-fire-in-winter paper. He danced a little caper in the middle
of the flowered carpet. Caemlyn to see, and a queen to meet. Your own words will free me of you,
Amyrlin. And get me away from Selene, too.
“You’ll never catch me,” he laughed, and meant it for both of them. “You’ll never catch Mat
Cauthon.”

CHAPTER
29

A Trap to Spring

In a corner the spit dog was lying at its ease. Glaring at it, Nynaeve mopped sweat from her
forehead with her hand and leaned her back into doing the work he should have done. I’d not have
put it past them to shove me in his wicker wheel instead of letting me turn this Light-forsaken
handle! Aes Sedai! Burn them all! It was a measure of her upset that she used such language, and
another that she did not even notice she had done it. She did not think the fire in the long, gray stone
fireplace would seem any hotter if she crawled into it. She was sure the brindle dog was grinning at
her.
Elayne was skimming grease out of the dripping pan under the roasts with a long-handled
wooden spoon, while Egwene used its twin to baste the meat. The great kitchen went on about its
midday routine around them. Even the novices had grown so used to seeing Accepted there that they
hardly even glanced at the three women. Not that the cooks allowed the novices to dawdle for
gawking. Work built character, so the Aes Sedai said, and the cooks saw to it that the novices built
strong character. And the three Accepted, too.
Laras, the Mistress of the Kitchens—she was really the chief cook, but so many had used the
other for so long that it might as well have been her title—came over to examine the roasts. And the
women sweating over them. She was more than merely stout, with layers of chins, and a spotless
white apron that could have made three novice dresses. She carried her own long-handled wooden
spoon like a scepter. It was not for stirring, that spoon. It was for directing those under her, and
smacking those who were not building character quickly enough to suit her. She studied the roasts,
sniffed disparagingly, and turned her frown on the three Accepted.
Nynaeve met Laras’ look with a level look of her own and kept turning the spit. The massive
woman’s face never altered. Nynaeve had tried smiling, but that did nothing to change Laras’
expression. Stopping work to speak to her, quite civilly, had been a disaster. It was bad enough being
bullied and chivied by Aes Sedai. She had to put up with that, however much it rankled and burned, if
she was to learn how to use her abilities. Not that she liked what she could do—it was one thing to
know Aes Sedai were not Darkfriends for channeling the Power, but quite another to know she herself
could channel—yet she had to learn if she was to get back at Moiraine; hating Moiraine for what she
had done to Egwene and the other Emond’s Fielders, pulling their lives apart and manipulating them
all for Aes Sedai purposes, was nearly all that kept her going. But to be treated as a lazy, none-toobright child by this Laras, to be forced to curtsy and scurry for this woman she could have put in her
place with a few well-chosen words back home—that made her grind her teeth almost as much as did
the thought of Moiraine. Maybe if I just do not look at her. . . . No! I will be burned if I’ll drop my
eyes before this . . . this cow!
Laras sniffed more loudly and walked away. She rolled from side to side as she crossed the

freshly mopped gray tiles.
Still bending with spoon and greasepot, Elayne glowered after her. “If that woman strikes me but
once more, I shall have Gareth Bryne arrest her and—”
“Be quiet,” Egwene whispered. She did not stop basting the roasts, and she never looked at
Elayne. “She has ears like a—”
Laras turned back as if she had indeed heard, her frown deepening, and her mouth opened wide.
Before a sound emerged, the Amyrlin Seat entered the kitchen like a whirlwind. Even the striped stole
on her shoulders seemed to bristle. For once, Leane was nowhere to be seen.
At last, Nynaeve thought grimly. And not beforetime, either!
But the Amyrlin did not glance her way. The Amyrlin did not say a word to anyone. Running her
hand across a tabletop scrubbed bone-white, she looked at her fingers and grimaced as if at filth.
Laras was at her side in an instant, all smiles, but the Amyrlin’s flat stare made her swallow them in
silence.
The Amyrlin stalked about the kitchen. She stared at the women slicing oatcake. She glared at the
women peeling vegetables. She sneered into the soup kettles, then at the women tending them; the
women became engrossed in studying the surface of the soup. Her frown set the girls carrying plates
and bowls out to the dining hall to a run. Her glower put the novices darting like mice sighting a cat.
By the time she had made her way half around the kitchen, every woman there was working twice as
fast as she had been. By the time she completed her circuit, Laras was the only one even daring to
glance at her.
The Amyrlin stopped in front of the roasting spit, fists on her hips, and looked at Laras. She only
looked, expressionless, blue eyes cold and hard.
The large woman gulped, and her chins wobbled as she smoothed her apron. The Amyrlin did
not blink. Laras’ eyes dropped, and she shifted heavily from foot to foot. “If the Mother will pardon
me,” she said in a faint voice. Making something that might have been meant for a curtsy, she rushed
away, so forgetting herself that she joined the women at one of the soup kettles and began stirring with
her own spoon.
Nynaeve smiled, keeping her head down to hide it. Egwene and Elayne kept working, too, but
they also kept glancing at the Amyrlin, standing with her back to them not two paces away.
The Amyrlin was spreading her stare across the entire kitchen from where she stood. “If they are
this easily cowed,” she muttered softly, “perhaps they really have been getting away with too much
for too long.”
Easily cowed indeed, Nynaeve thought. Pitiful excuses for women. All she did was look at
them! The Amyrlin glanced over a stole-covered shoulder, caught her eye for an instant. Suddenly
Nynaeve realized she was turning the spit faster. She told herself she had to pretend to be cowed like
everyone else.
The Amyrlin’s gaze fell on Elayne, and abruptly she spoke, nearly loud enough to rattle the
copper pots and pans hanging on the walls. “There are some words I will not tolerate in a young
woman’s mouth, Elayne of House Trakand. If you let them in, I will see them scrubbed out!”
Everyone in the kitchen jumped.
Elayne looked confused, and indignation crept across Egwene’s face.
Nynaeve shook her head, small frantic shakes. No, girl! Hold your tongue! Don’t you see what
she is doing?
But Egwene did open her mouth, with a respectful if determined, “Mother, she did not—”
“Silence!” The Amyrlin’s roar produced another ripple of jumps. “Laras! Can you find

something to teach two girls to speak when they should and say what they should, Mistress of the
Kitchens? Can you manage that?”
Laras came waddling faster than Nynaeve had ever seen the woman move before, darting at
Elayne and Egwene to seize an ear of each, all the while repeating, “Yes, Mother. Immediately,
Mother. As you command, Mother.” She hurried the two young women out of the kitchen as if eager to
escape the Amyrlin’s stare.
The Amyrlin was now close enough to Nynaeve to touch her, but still looking over the kitchen. A
young cook, turning with a mixing bowl in her hands, chanced to catch the Amyrlin’s eye. She gave a
great squeak as she scuttled away across the floor.
“I did not mean for Egwene to be caught in that.” The Amyrlin barely moved her lips. It looked
as if she were muttering to herself, and from the expression on her face, no one in the kitchen wanted
to hear what she was saying. Nynaeve could just make out the words. “But perhaps it will teach her to
think before she speaks.”
Nynaeve turned the spit and kept her head down, trying to look as if she were also muttering
under her breath if anyone looked. “I thought you were going to keep a close eye on us, Mother. So
we could report what we find.”
“If I come stare at you every day, Daughter, some would grow suspicious.” The Amyrlin kept up
her study of the kitchen. Most of the women seemed to be avoiding even looking in her direction for
fear of incurring her wrath. “I planned to have you brought to my study after the midday meal. To
scold you for not choosing your studies, so I implied to Leane. But there is news that could not wait.
Sheriam found another Gray Man. A woman. Dead as last week’s fish, and not a mark on her. She
was laid out as if resting, right in the middle of Sheriam’s bed. Not very pleasant for Sheriam.”
Nynaeve stiffened, and the spit halted for a moment before she put it back to revolving. “Sheriam
had a chance to see the lists Verin gave to Egwene. So did Elaida. I make no accusations, but they had
the chance. And Egwene said Alanna . . . behaved oddly, too.”
“She told you of that, did she? Alanna is Arafellin. They have strange ideas about honor and
debts in Arafel.” She shrugged dismissively, but said, “I suppose I can keep an eye on her. Have you
learned anything useful yet, child?”
“Some,” Nynaeve muttered grimly. What about keeping an eye on Sheriam? Maybe she didn’t
just find that Gray Man. The Amyrlin could watch Elaida, too, for that matter. So Alanna really
did. . . . “I do not understand why you trust Else Grinwell, but your message was helpful.”
In short, quick sentences, Nynaeve told of the things they had found in the storeroom under the
library, making it seem only she and Egwene had gone, and added the conclusions they had reached
concerning them. She did not mention Egwene’s dream—or whatever it had been; Egwene insisted it
had been real—of Tel’aran’rhiod. Nor did she speak of the ter’angreal Verin had given Egwene.
She could not make herself entirely trust the woman wearing the seven-striped stole—or any woman
who could wear the shawl, for that matter—and it seemed best to keep some things in reserve.
When she was done, the Amyrlin was silent so long that Nynaeve began to think the woman had
not heard. She was about to repeat herself, a little louder, when the Amyrlin finally spoke, still hardly
moving her lips.
“I sent no message, Daughter. The things Liandrin and the others left were searched thoroughly,
and burned after nothing was found. No one would use Black Ajah leavings. As for Else Grinwell.
. . . I remember the girl. She could have learned, had she applied herself, but all she wanted was to
smile at the men at the Warders’ practice yard. Else Grinwell was put on a trading vessel and sent
back to her mother ten days ago.”

Nynaeve tried to swallow the lump that had formed in her throat. The Amyrlin’s words made her
think of bullies taunting smaller children. The bullies were always so contemptuous of the littler
children, always so sure the small ones were too stupid to realize what was happening, that they made
little effort to disguise their snares. That the Black Ajah was so contemptuous of her made her blood
boil. That they could set this snare filled her stomach with ice. Light, if Else was sent away. . . .
Light, anybody I talk to could be Liandrin, or any of the others. Light!
The spit had stopped. Hastily she started jt turning once more. No one seemed to have noticed,
though. They were all still doing their best not to look at the Amyrlin.
“And what do you mean to do about this . . . so-obvious trap?” the Amyrlin said softly, still
staring over the kitchen, away from Nynaeve. “Do you mean to fall into this one, too?”
Nynaeve’s face reddened. “I know this trap for a trap. Mother. And the best way to catch
whoever set a trap is to spring it and wait for him—or her—to come.” It sounded weaker than it had
when she had said it to Egwene and Elayne, after what the Amyrlin had just told her, but she still
meant it.
“Perhaps so, child. Perhaps it is the way to find them. If they do not come and find you held
tightly in their net.” She gave a vexed sigh. “I will put gold in your room for the journey. And I will
let it be whispered about that I have sent you out to a farm to hoe cabbages. Will Elayne be going with
you?”
Nynaeve forgot herself enough to stare at the Amyrlin, then hurriedly put her eyes back on her
hands. Her knuckles were white on the spit handle. “You scheming old. . . . Why all the pretense, if
you knew? Your sly plots have had us squirming nearly as much as the Black Ajah has. Why?” The
Amyrlin’s face had tightened, enough to make her force a more respectful tone. “If I may ask,
Mother.”
The Amyrlin snorted. “Putting Morgase back on the proper path whether she wants to go or not
will be hard enough without her thinking I’ve sent her daughter to sea in a leaky skiff. This way I can
say straight out that it was none of my doing. It may be a bit hard on Elayne, when she finally has to
face her mother, but I have three hounds, now, not two. I told you I’d have a hundred if I could.” She
adjusted her stole on her shoulders. “This has gone on long enough. If I stay this close to you, it may
be noticed. Have you anything more to tell me? Or to ask? Make it quick, Daughter.”
“What is Callandor, Mother?” Nynaeve asked.
This time it was the Amyrlin who forgot herself, half turning toward Nynaeve before jerking
herself back. “They cannot be allowed to have that.” Her whisper was barely audible, as if meant for
her own ears alone. “They cannot possibly take it, but. . . .” She took a deep breath, and her soft
words firmed enough to be clear to Nynaeve, if to no one two paces further away. “No more than a
dozen women in the Tower know what Callandor is, and perhaps as many outside. The High Lords of
Tear know, but they never speak of it except when a Lord of the Land is told on being raised. The
Sword That Cannot Be Touched is a sa’angreal, girl. Only two more powerful were ever made, and
thank the Light, neither of those was ever used. With Callandor in your hands, child, you could level
a city at one blow. If you die keeping that out of the Black Ajah’s hands—you, and Egwene, and
Elayne, all three—you’ll have done a service to the whole world, and cheap at the price.”
“How could they take it?” Nynaeve asked. “I thought only the Dragon Reborn could touch
Callandor.”
The Amyrlin gave her a sideways look sharp enough to carve the roasts on the spit. “They could
be after something else,” she said after a moment. “They stole ter’angreal here. The Stone of Tear
holds nearly as many ter’angreal as the Tower.”

“I thought the High Lords hated anything to do with the One Power,” Nynaeve whispered
incredulously.
“Oh, they do hate it, child. Hate it, and fear it. When they find a Tairen girl who can channel,
they bundle her onto a ship for Tar Valon before the day is done, with hardly time to speak goodbyes
to her family.” The Amyrlin’s murmur was bitter with memory. “Yet they hold one of the most
powerful focuses of the Power the world has ever seen, inside their precious Stone. It is my belief
that is why they have collected so many ter’angreal—and indeed, anything to do with the Power—
over the years, as if by doing so they can diminish the existence of the thing they cannot rid
themselves of, the thing that reminds them of their own doom every time they enter the Heart of the
Stone. Their fortress that has broken a hundred armies will fall as one of the signs the Dragon is
Reborn. Not even the only sign; just one. How that must rankle their proud hearts. Their downfall will
not even be the one great sign of the world’s change. They cannot even ignore it by staying out of the
Heart. That is where Lords of the Land are raised to High Lords, and where they must perform what
they call the Rite of the Guarding four times a year, claiming that they guard the whole world against
the Dragon by holding Callandor. It must bite at their souls like a bellyful of live silverpike, and no
more than they deserve.” She gave herself a shake, as if realizing she had said far more than she had
intended. “Is that all, child?”
“Yes, Mother,” Nynaeve said. Light, it always comes back to Rand, doesn’t it? Always back to
the Dragon Reborn. It was still an effort to think of him that way. “That’s all.”
The Amyrlin shifted her stole again, frowning at the frenzied scurry in the kitchen. “I’ll have to
set this aright. I needed to speak to you without delay, but Laras is a good woman, and she manages
the kitchen and the larders well.”
Nynaeve sniffed, and addressed her hands on the spit handle. “Laras is a sour lump of lard, and
too handy with that spoon by half.” She thought she had muttered it under her breath, but she heard the
Amyrlin chuckle wryly.
“You are a fine judge of character, child. You must have done well as the Wisdom of your
village. It was Laras who went to Sheriam and demanded to know how long you three are to be kept
to the dirtiest and hardest work, without a turn at lighter. She said she would not be a party to
breaking any woman’s health or spirit, no matter what I said. A fine judge of character, child.”
Laras came back into the kitchen doorway then, hesitating to enter her own domain. The Amyrlin
went to meet her, smiles replacing her frowns and stares.
“It all looks very well to me, Laras.” The Amyrlin’s words came loud enough for the entire
kitchen to hear. “I see nothing out of place, and everything as it should be. You are to be commended.
I think I will make Mistress of the Kitchens a formal title.”
The stout woman’s face fluttered from uneasiness to shock to beaming pleasure. By the time the
Amyrlin swept out of the kitchen, Laras was all smiles. Her frown returned, though, as she looked
from the Amyrlin’s departing back to her workers. The kitchen seemed to leap into motion. Laras’
grim stare settled on Nynaeve.
Turning the spit again, Nynaeve tried smiling at the big woman.
Laras’ frown deepened, and she began tapping her spoon on her thigh, apparently forgetting that
for once it had been used for its intended purpose. It left smears of soup on the white of her apron.
I will smile at her if if kills me, Nynaeve thought, though she had to grit her teeth to do it.
Egwene and Elayne appeared, twisting their faces and scrubbing their mouths with their sleeves.
At a stare from Laras, they dashed to the spit and resumed their labors.
“Soap,” Elayne muttered thickly, “tastes horrid!”

Egwene trembled as she spooned juice from the dripping pan over the roasts. “Nynaeve, if you
tell me the Amyrlin told us to stay here, I will scream. I might run away for real.”
“We leave after the washing up is done,” she told them, “just as quickly as we can fetch our
belongings from our rooms.” She wished she could share the eagerness that flashed in their eyes.
Light send we aren’t walking into a trap we can’t get out of. Light send it so.

CHAPTER

The First Toss

After Nynaeve and the others left him, Mat spent most of the day in his room, except for one
brief excursion. He was planning. And eating. He ate nearly everything the serving women brought
him, and asked for more. They were more than happy to oblige. It was bread and cheese and fruit he
asked for, and he piled winter-wrinkled apples and pears, wedges of cheese and loaves of bread
inside the wardrobe, leaving empty trays for them to take away.
At midday he had to endure a visit from an Aes Sedai—Anaiya, he seemed to remember her
name was. She put her hands on his head and sent cold chills through him. It was the One Power, he
decided, not simply being touched by an Aes Sedai. She was a plain woman despite her smooth
cheeks and Aes Sedai serenity.
“You seem much better,” she told him, smiling. Her smile made him think of his mother. “Even
hungrier than I expected, so I hear, but better. I am informed you are trying to eat the larders bare.
Believe me when I say we will see you have all the food you need. You do not have to worry that
we’ll let you miss a meal before you are fully well again.”
He gave the grin he used on his mother when he especially wanted her to believe him. “I know
you won’t. And I do feel better. I thought I might see some of the city this afternoon. If you have no
objections, of course. Maybe visit an inn tonight. There’s nothing like a night of common-room talk to
pick one’s spirits up.”
He thought her lips twitched on the edge of a bigger smile. “No one will try to stop you, Mat. But
do not try to leave the city. It will only upset the guards, and bring you nothing but a trip back here
under escort.”
“I would not do that, Aes Sedai. The Amyrlin Seat said I’d starve to death in a few days if I
left.”
She nodded as if she did not believe a word he said. “Of course.” As she turned from him, her
eyes fell on the quarterstaff he had brought from the practice yard, propped in the corner of the room.
“You do not need to protect yourself from us, Mat. You are as safe here as you could be anywhere.
Almost certainly safer.”
“Oh, I know that, Aes Sedai. I do.” After she left he frowned at the door, wondering if he had
managed to convince her of anything.
It was more evening than afternoon when he left the room for what he hoped was the final time.
The sky was purpling, and the setting sun painted clouds to the west in shades of red. Once he had his
cloak around him, and the big leather scrip he had found on his one earlier foray dangling from his
shoulder and bulging with the bread and cheese and fruit he had squirreled away, one look in the
mirror told him there was no hiding what he intended. He tied the rest of his clothes up in a roll with
the blanket from the bed and slung that across his shoulders, too. The quarterstaff did for a walking

staff. He left nothing behind. His coat pockets held all his smaller belongings, and his belt pouch held
the most important. The Amyrlin Seat’s paper. Elayne’s letter. And his dice cups.
He saw Aes Sedai as he made his way out of the Tower, and some of them noticed him, though
most merely flickered an eyebrow, and none spoke to him. Anaiya was one. She gave him an amused
smile and a rueful shake of her head. He returned a shrug and the guiltiest grin he could manage, and
she went silently on, still shaking her head. The guards at the Tower gates simply looked at him.
It was not until he was across the big square and into the streets of the city that relief finally
surged up in him. And triumph. If you can’t hide what you are going to do, do it so everybody thinks
you are a fool. Then they stand around waiting to see you fall on your face. Those Aes Sedai will
be waiting for the guards to bring me back. When I do not return by morning, then they’ll start a
search. Not too frantic at first, because they’ll think I have gone to ground somewhere in the city.
By the time they realize I haven’t, this rabbit will be a long way downriver from the hounds.
With as light a heart as he could remember having in years, or so it seemed, he began to hum
“We’re Over the Border Again,” heading toward the harbor where vessels would be sailing down to
Tear and all the villages along the Erinin between. He would not be going so far as that, of course.
Aringill, where he would take to land again for the rest of the trip to Caemlyn, was only halfway
downriver.
I’ll deliver your bloody letter. The nerve of her, thinking I’d say I would, then not. I will
deliver the bloody thing if it kills me.
Twilight was beginning to cover Tar Valon, but there was still enough light to grace the
fantastical buildings, and the oddly shaped towers connected by high bridges spanning open air over
hundred-pace drops. People yet filled the streets, in so many different kinds of clothing that he thought
every nation must be represented. Along the major avenues, pairs of lamplighters used their ladders
to light lanterns atop tall poles. But in the part of Tar Valon he sought, the only light was what spilled
from windows.
Ogier had built the great buildings and towers of Tar Valon, but other, newer parts had grown
under the hands of men. Newer meaning two thousand years in some cases. Down near South harbor,
men’s hands had tried to match, if not duplicate, the fanciful Ogier work. Inns where ships’ crews
caroused bore enough stonework for palaces. Statues in niches and cupolas on rooftops, ornately
worked cornices and intricately carved friezes, all decorated chandlers’ shops and merchant houses.
Bridges arched across the streets here, too, but the streets were cobblestone, not great paving blocks,
and many of the bridges were wood instead of stone, sometimes as low as the second stories of the
buildings they joined, and never higher than four.
The dark streets hummed with as much life as any in Tar Valon. Traders off their vessels and
those who bought what the vessels carried, people who traveled the River Erinin and people who
worked it, all filled the taverns and the common rooms of the inns, in company with those who sought
the money such folk carried, by fair means or murky. Raucous music filled the streets from bittern and
flute, harp and hammered dulcimer. The first inn Mat entered had three dice games in progress, men
crouched in circles near the common-room walls and shouting the wins and losses.
He only meant to gamble an hour or so before finding a ship, just long enough to add a few coins
to his purse, but he won. He had always won more than he lost, as far as he could remember, and
there had been times with Hurin, and in Shienar, when six or eight tosses in a row won for him.
Tonight, every toss won. Every toss.
From the looks some of the men gave him, he was glad he had left his own dice in his pouch.
Those looks made him decide to move on. With surprise he realized that he had nearly thirty silver

marks in his purse now, but he had not won so much from any one man that they would not all be glad
to see him go.
Except for one dark sailor with tight curls—one of the Sea Folk, someone had said, though Mat
wondered what one of the Atha’an Miere was doing so far from the sea—who followed him down the
darkened street, arguing for a chance to make good his losses. He wanted to reach the docks—thirty
silver marks was more than enough—but the sailor argued on, and he had only used half his hour, so
he gave in, and with the man entered the next tavern they passed.
He won again, and it was as if a fever gripped him. He won every throw. From tavern to inn to
tavern he went, never staying long enough to anger anyone with the amount of his winnings. And he
still won every toss. He exchanged silver for gold with a money changer. He played at crowns, and
fives, and maiden’s ruin. He played games with five dice, and with four, and three, and even only
two. He played games he did not know before he squatted in the circle, or took a place at the table.
And he won. Somewhere during the night, the dark sailor—Raab, he had said his name was—
staggered away, exhausted but with a full purse; he had decided to put his wagers on Mat. Mat visited
another money changer—or perhaps two; the fever seemed to cloud his brain as badly as his
memories of the past were clouded—and made his way to another game. Winning.
And so he found himself, he did not know how many hours later, in a tavern filled with tabac
smoke—The Tremalking Splice, he thought it was called—staring down at five dice, each showing a
deeply carved crown. Most of the patrons here seemed interested only in drinking as much as they
could, but the rattle of dice and shouts of players from another game in the far corner were almost
submerged by a woman singing to a quick tune from a hammered dulcimer.
“I’ll dance with a girl with eyes of brown,
or a girl with eyes of green,
I’ll dance with a girl with any color eyes,
but yours are the prettiest I’ve seen.
I’ll kiss a girl with hair of black,
or a girl with hair of gold,
I’ll kiss a girl with any color hair,
but it’s you I want to hold.”
The singer had named the song as “What He Said to Me.” Mat remembered the tune as “Will
You Dance With Me,” with different words, but at that moment all he could think of were those dice.
“The king again,” one of the men squatting with Mat muttered. It was the fifth time in a row Mat
had thrown the king.
He had won the bet of a gold mark, not even caring by this time that his Andoran mark
outweighed the other man’s Illianer coin, but he scooped the dice into the leather cup, rattled it hard,
and spun them across the floor again. Five crowns. Light, it can’t be. Nobody ever threw the king six
times running. Nobody.
“The Dark One’s own luck,” another man growled. He was a bulky fellow, his dark hair tied at
the nape of his neck with a black ribbon, with heavy shoulders, scars on his face, and a nose that had
been broken more than once.
Mat was scarcely aware of moving before he had the bulky man by the collar, hauling him to his
feet, slamming him back against the wall. “Don’t you say that!” he snarled. “Don’t you ever say that!”
The man blinked down at him in astonishment; he was a full head taller than Mat.
“Just a saying,” somebody behind him was muttering. “Light, it’s just a saying.”

Mat released his grip on the scar-faced man’s coat and backed away. “I. . . . I . . . I don’t like
anybody saying things like that about me. I’m no Darkfriend!” Burn me, not the Dark One’s luck. Not
that! Oh, Light, did that bloody dagger really do something to me?
“Nobody said you was,” the broken-nosed man muttered. He seemed to be getting over his
surprise, and trying to decide whether to be angry.
Gathering his belongings from where he had piled them behind him, Mat walked out of the
tavern, leaving the coins where they lay. It was not that he was afraid of the big man. He had forgotten
the man, and the coins, too. All he wanted was to be outside, in fresh air, where he could think.
In the street, he leaned against the wall of the tavern not far from the door, breathing the coolness
in. The dark streets of Southharbor were all but empty, now. Music and laughter still floated from the
inns and taverns, but few people made their way through the night. Holding the quarterstaff upright in
front of him with both hands, he lowered his head to his fists and tried to think at the puzzle from
every side.
He knew he was lucky. He could remember always being lucky. But somehow, his memories
from Emond’s Field did not show him as lucky as he had been since leaving. Certainly he had gotten
away with a great deal, but he could remember also being caught in pranks he had been sure would
succeed. His mother had always seemed to know what he was up to, and Nynaeve able to see through
whatever defenses he put up. But it was not just since leaving the Two Rivers that he had become
lucky. The luck had come once he took the dagger from Shadar Logoth. He remembered playing at
dice back home with a sharp-eyed, skinny man who worked for a merchant come down from Baerlon
to buy tabac. He remembered the strapping his father had given him, too, on learning Mat owed the
man a silver mark and four pence.
“But I’m free of the bloody dagger,” he mumbled. “Those bloody Aes Sedai said I was.” He
wondered how much he had won tonight.
When he dug into his coat pockets, he found them filled with loose coins, crowns and marks,
both silver and gold that glittered and glinted in the light from nearby windows. He had two purses
now, it seemed, and both fat. He undid the strings, and found more gold. And still more stuffed into
his belt pouch between and around and on top of his dice cups, crumpling Elayne’s letter and the
Amyrlin’s paper. He had a memory of tossing silver pence to serving girls because they had pretty
smiles or pretty eyes or pretty ankles, and because silver pence were not worth keeping.
Not worth keeping? Maybe they weren’t. Light, I’m rich! I am bloody rich! Maybe it was
something the Aes Sedai did. Something they did Healing me. By accident, maybe. That could be it.
Better that the other. Those bloody Aes Sedai must have done it to me.
A big man moved out from the tavern, the door already swinging shut to cut off the light that
might have shown his face.
Mat pressed his back close against the wall, stuffed the purses back into his coat, and firmed his
grip on the quarterstaff. Wherever his luck tonight had come from, he did not mean to lose all that
gold to a footpad.
The man turned toward him, peered, then gave a start. “C-cool night,” he said drunkenly. He
staggered closer, and Mat saw that most of his size was fat. “I have to. . . . I have to. . . .” Stumbling,
the fat man moved on up the street, talking to himself disjointedly.
“Fool!” Mat muttered, but he was not sure whether he meant it for the fat man or for himself.
“Time to find a ship to take me away from here.” He squinted at the black sky, trying to estimate how
long till dawn. Two, maybe three hours, he thought. “Past time.” His stomach growled at him; he
dimly recalled eating in some of the inns, but he did not remember what. The fever of the dice had had

him by the throat. A hand pushed into the scrip found only crumbs. “Way past time. Or one of them
will come pick me up with her fingers and stick me in her pouch.” He pushed away from the wall and
started for the docks, where the ships would be.
At first he thought the faint sounds behind him were echoes of his boots on the cobblestones.
Then he realized someone was following him. And trying to be stealthy. Well, these are footpads, for
sure.
Hefting the quarterstaff, he briefly considered turning to confront them. But it was dark, and the
footing on cobblestones uncertain, and he had no idea how many there were. Just because you did
well against Gawyn and Galad doesn’t make you a bloody hero out of a story.
He turned down a narrower, twisting side street, trying to walk on tiptoe and move quickly at the
same time. Every window was dark here, and most shuttered. He was almost to the end when he saw
movement ahead, two men peering into the side street from where it let out onto another. And he
heard slow footsteps behind him, soft scrapes of boot leather on stone.
In an instant he ducked into the shadowy corner where one building stuck out further than the
next. It seemed the best he could do for the moment. Gripping the quarterstaff nervously, he waited.
A man appeared from back the way he had come, crouching as he eased himself ahead one slow
step at a time, and then another man. Each carried a knife in his hand and moved as if stalking.
Mat tensed. If they came just a few steps closer before they noticed him hiding in the deeper
shadows of the corner, he could take them by surprise. He wished his stomach would stop fluttering.
Those knives were a great deal shorter than the practice swords, but they were steel, not wood.
One of the men squinted toward the far end of the narrow street and suddenly straightened,
shouting, “Didn’t he come your way, then?”
“I have seen nothing but the shadows,” came the answer in a heavy accent. “I wish to be out of
this. There are the strange things moving this night.”
Not four paces from Mat, the two men exchanged looks, sheathed their knives, and trotted back
the way they had come.
He let out a long, slow breath. Luck. Burn me if it’s not good for more than dice.
He could no longer see the men at the mouth of the street, but he knew they were still out on the
next street somewhere. And more behind him the other way.
One of the buildings he was crouched against stood only a single story high here, and the roof
looked flat enough. And a white stone frieze carved in huge grape leaves ran up the joining of the two
buildings.
Easing his quarterstaff up till one end rested on the edge of the roof, he gave it a hard shove. It
landed with a clatter on the roof tiles. Not waiting to see if anyone had heard, he scrambled up the
frieze, the big leaves giving easy toeholds even for a man in boots. In seconds he had the staff back in
hand and was trotting across the roof, trusting to luck for his footing.
Three more times he climbed, each time gaining one story. The slightly sloping, tiled roofs ran
some distance at that level, and there was a breeze at that height, prickling the hair on the back of his
neck with its chill and almost making him think he was being followed. Stop that, fool! They’re three
streets away by now, looking for somebody else with a fat purse, and bad luck to them.
His boots slipped on the tiles, and he decided it might be a good idea to think about getting back
down into the street himself. Cautiously, he moved to the edge of the roof and peered down. An empty
street lay a good forty feet or more below him, with three taverns and an inn spilling light and music
onto the cobblestones. But off to his right was a stone bridge running from the top floor of his building
to the one on the other side.

The bridge looked awfully narrow, running through darkness untouched by the tavern lights,
arcing over a long fall to hard cobblestones, but he tossed the quarterstaff down and made himself
follow before he could think about it too much. His boots thumped onto the bridge, and he let himself
roll the way he had as a boy falling out of a tree. He fetched up against the waist-high railing.
“Bad habits pay off in the long run,” he told himself as he got to his feet and picked up the staff.
The window at the other end of the bridge was tightly shuttered and lightless. He did not think
whoever lived in there would appreciate a stranger appearing in the middle of the night. He could see
lots of stonework, but if there was as much as a fingerhold in reach of the bridge, the night hid it.
Well, stranger or no stranger, inside I go.
He turned from the railing and suddenly became aware of a man sharing the bridge with him. A
man with a dagger in his hand.
Mat grabbed at the hand as the knife darted toward his throat. He barely caught the fellow’s
wrist with his fingers, and then the quarterstaff between them tangled itself in his legs, tripping him to
fall back against the railing, to fall half over it pulling the other man on top of him. Balanced there on
the small of his back, teetering with his assailant’s bared teeth in his face, he was as aware of the
long drop under his head as he was of the blade catching faint moonlight as it edged toward his throat.
His finger grip on the man’s wrist was slipping, and his other hand was caught with the quarterstaff
between their bodies. Only seconds had passed since he first saw the man, and in seconds more, he
was going die with a knife in his throat.
“Time to toss the dice,” he said. He thought the other man looked confused for an instant, but an
instant was all he had. With a heave of his legs, Mat flipped them both off into the empty air.
For a stretched-out moment he seemed to have no weight. Air whistled past his ears and ruffled
his hair. He thought he heard the other man scream, or start to. The impact knocked all the air out of
his lungs and made silver-black flecks dance across his blurring vision.
When he could breathe again—and see—he realized he was lying on top of the man who had
attacked him, his fall cushioned by the other’s body. “Luck,” he whispered. Slowly he climbed to his
feet, cursing the bruise the quarterstaff had put across his ribs.
He expected the other man to be dead—not many could survive a thirty-foot fall to cobblestones
with another’s weight on top of him—but what he had not expected was to see the fellow’s dagger
driven to the hilt into his own heart. Such an ordinary-looking man to have tried to kill him. Mat did
not think he would even have noticed him in a crowded room.
“You had bad luck, fellow,” he told the corpse shakily.
Suddenly, everything that had happened rushed back in on him. The footpads in the twisting
street. The scramble over the rooftops. This fellow. The fall. His eyes rose to the bridge overhead,
and a fit of trembling hit him. I must have been crazy. A little adventure is one thing, but Rogosh
Eagle-eye wouldn’t ask for this.
He realized he was standing over a dead man with a dagger in his chest, just waiting for
someone to come along and run shouting for city guards with the Flame of Tar Valon on their chests.
The Amyrlin’s paper might get him away from them, but maybe not before she found out. He could
still end up back in the White Tower, without that paper, and possibly not even allowed outside the
Tower grounds.
He knew he should be on his way to the docks right then, and on the first vessel sailing if it was
a rotten tub full of old fish, but his knees were shaking hard enough in reaction that he could hardly
walk. What he wanted was to sit down for just a minute. Just a minute to steady his knees, and then he
was headed for the docks.

The taverns were closer, but he started toward the inn. The common room of an inn was a
friendly place, where a man could rest a minute and not worry about who might be sneaking up behind
him. Enough light came out through the windows for him to make out the sign. A woman with her hair
in braids, holding what he thought was an olive branch, and the words “The Woman of Tanchico.”

CHAPTER
31

The Woman of Tanchico

The common room of the inn was brightly lit, the tables not near a quarter full so late. A few
white-aproned serving women with mugs of ale or wine passed among the men, and a low murmur of
talk ran under the sound of a harp being strummed and plucked. The patrons, some with pipes
clenched in their teeth and one pair hunched over a stones board, had the look of ship’s officers and
minor merchants from the smaller houses, their coats well cut and of fine wool, but with none of the
gold or silver or embroidery that richer men might have had. And for once there was no clack and
rattle of dice to be heard. Fires blazed on the long hearths at the ends of the room, but even without
those there would have been a warm feeling about the place.
The harper stood on a tabletop, reciting “Mara and the Three Foolish Kings,” to the music of his
harp. His instrument, all worked in gold and silver, was fit for a palace. Mat knew him. He had saved
Mat’s life, once.
The harper was a lean man who would have been tall except for a stoop, and he moved with a
limp when he shifted his footing on the tabletop. Even here inside, he wore his cloak, all covered
with fluttering patches in a hundred colors. He always wanted everyone to know he was a gleeman.
His long mustaches and bushy eyebrows were as snow-white as the thick hair on his head, and his
blue eyes held a look of sorrow as he recited. The look was as unexpected as the man. Mat had never
known Thom Merrilin to be a sorrowful man.
He took a table, setting his things on the floor by his stool, and ordered two mugs. The pretty
young serving girl’s big brown eyes twinkled at him.
“Two, young master? You do not look such a hard-drinking man as that.” Her voice held a
mischievous edge of laughter.
After rummaging a bit, he brought out two silver pennies from his pocket. One more than paid for
the wine, but he slipped her another for her eyes. “My friend will be joining me.”
He knew Thom had seen him. The old gleeman had nearly stopped the story dead when Mat
came in. That was new, too. Few things startled Thom enough for him to let it show, and nothing short
of Trollocs had ever made him stop a story in the middle that Mat knew. When the girl brought the
wine and his coppers in change, he let the pewter mugs sit and listened to the end of the story.
“ ‘It was as we have said it should be,’ said King Madel, trying to untangle a fish from his long
beard.” Thom’s voice seemed almost to echo inside a great hall, not an ordinary common room. His
plucked harp sounded the three kings’ final foolishness. “ ‘It was as we said it would be,’ announced
Orander. And, feet slipping in the mud, he sat down with a great splash. ‘It was as we said it must
be,’ proclaimed Kadar as he searched, up to his elbows in the river, for his crown. ‘The woman
knows not whereof she speaks. She is the fool!’ Madel and Orander agreed with him loudly. And

with that, Mara had had enough. ‘I’ve given them all the chances they deserve and more,’ she
murmured to herself. Slipping Kadar’s crown into her bag with the first two, she climbed back onto
her cart, clucked to her mare, and drove straight back to her village. And when Mara had told them all
that happened, the people of Heape would have no king at all.” He strummed the major theme of the
kings’ foolishness once more, this time sliding to a crescendo that sounded even more like laughter,
made a sweeping bow, and nearly fell off the table.
Men laughed and stamped their feet, though likely every one of them had heard the story many
times before, and called for more. The story of Mara was always well received, except perhaps by
kings.
Thom nearly fell again climbing down from the table, and he was more unsteady in his walk than
a somewhat stiff leg could account for as he came to where Mat was sitting. Casually putting his harp
on the table, he dropped onto a stool in front of the second mug and gave Mat a flat stare. His eyes
had always been sharp as awls, but they seemed to be having trouble focusing.
“Common,” he muttered. His voice was still deep, but it no longer seemed to reverberate. “The
tale is a hundred times better in Plain Chant, and a thousand in High, but they want Common.” Without
another word, he buried his face in his wine.
Mat could not recall ever seeing Thom finish playing that harp without immediately putting it
away in its hard leather case. He had never seen him the worse for drink. It was a relief to hear the
gleeman complaining about his listeners; Thom never thought their standards were as high as his. At
least something of him had not changed.
The serving girl was back, with no twinkle in her eyes. “Oh, Thom,” she said softly, then
rounded on Mat. “If I’d known he was the friend you awaited, I’d not have brought you wine for him
if you gave a hundred silver pence.”
“I did not know he was drunk,” Mat protested.
But her attention was back on Thom, her voice gentle again. “Thom, you need some rest. They’ll
keep you telling stories all night and all day, if you let them.”
Another woman appeared on Thom’s other side, lifting her apron off over her head. She was
older than the first, but no less pretty. The two might have been sisters. “A beautiful story, I’ve
always thought, Thom, and you tell it beautifully. Come, I’ve slipped a warming pan into your bed,
and you can tell me all about the court in Caemlyn.”
Thom peered into the mug as if surprised to find it empty, then blew out his long mustaches and
looked from one woman to the other. “Pretty Mada. Pretty Saal. Did I ever tell you that two pretty
women have loved me in my life? That is more than most men can claim.”
“You’ve told us all about it, Thom,” the older woman said sadly. The younger glared at Mat as if
this were all his fault.
“Two,” Thom murmured. “Morgase had a temper, but I thought I could ignore that, so it ended
with her wanting to kill me. Dena, I killed. As good as. Not much difference. Two chances I’ve had,
more than most, and I threw them both away.”
“I will take care of him,” Mat said. Mada and Saal were both glaring at him, now. He gave them
his best smile, but it did not work. His stomach muttered loudly. “Don’t I smell chicken roasting?
Bring me three or four.” The two women blinked and exchanged startled looks when he added, “Do
you want something to eat, too, Thom?”
“I could do with more of this fine Andoran wine.” The gleeman raised his cup hopefully.
“No more wine for you tonight, Thom.” The older woman would have taken his cup if he had let
her.

Almost on top of the first woman, the younger said, in a mixture of firmness and pleading,
“You’ll have some chicken, Thom. It is very good.”
Neither would leave until the gleeman agreed to eat something, and when they did go, they gave
Mat such a combination of stares and sniffs that he could only shake his head. Burn me, you would
think I was encouraging him to drink more! Women! But pretty eyes on the pair of them.
“Rand said you were alive,” he told Thom when Mada and Saal were out of hearing. “Moiraine
always said she thought you were. But I heard you were in Cairhien, and meaning to go on to Tear.”
“Rand is still well, then?” Thom’s eyes sharpened to almost the keenness Mat remembered. “I
am not sure I expected that. Moiraine is still with him, is she? A fine-looking woman. A fine woman,
if she were not Aes Sedai. Meddle with that sort, and you get more than your fingers burned.”
“Why wouldn’t you expect Rand to be all right?” Mat asked carefully. “Do you know of
something that could harm him?”
“Know? I don’t know anything, boy. I suspect more than is healthy for me, but I know nothing.”
Mat abandoned that line of talk. No use firming his suspicions. No use letting him know I know
more than’s healthy myself.
The older woman—Thom called her Mada—came back with three chickens with crisp, brown
skins, giving the white-haired man a worried look, and Mat a warning one, before she left. Mat
ripped off a leg and set to as he talked. Thom frowned into his cup and never looked at the birds.
“Why are you here in Tar Valon, Thom? It’s the last place I’d have expected to see you, the way
you feel about Aes Sedai. I heard you were coining money in Cairhien.”
“Cairhien,” the old gleeman muttered, the sharpness fading from his eyes again. “Such trouble it
causes killing a man, even when he deserves killing.” He made a flourish with one hand and was
holding a knife. Thom always had knives secreted about him. Drunk he might have been, but he held
the blade steady enough. “Kill a man who needs killing, and sometimes others pay for it. The question
is, was it worth doing anyway? There’s always a balance, you know. Good and evil. Light and
Shadow. We would not be human if there wasn’t a balance.”
“Put that away,” Mat growled around a mouthful. “I don’t want to talk about killing.” Light, that
fellow is still lying right out there in the street. Burn me, I ought to be on a ship by now. “I just
asked why you’re in Tar Valon. If you had to leave Cairhien because you killed someone, I do not
want to know about it. Blood and ashes, if you can’t pull your wits out of the wine enough to talk
straight, I’ll leave now.”
With a sour look, Thom made the knife disappear. “Why am I in Tar Valon? I’m here because it
is the worst place I could be, except maybe Caemlyn. It’s what I deserve, boy. Some of the Red Ajah
still remember me. I saw Elaida in the street the other day. If she knew I was here, she would peel my
hide off in strips, and then she would stop being pleasant.”
“I never knew you to feel sorry for yourself,” Mat said disgustedly. “Do you mean to drown
yourself in wine?”
“What do you know of it, boy?” Thom snarled. “Put a few years on you, see something of life,
maybe love a woman or two, and then you’ll know. Perhaps you will, if you have the brains to learn.
Aaaah! You want to know why I’m in Tar Valon? Why are you in Tar Valon? I remember you
shivering when you found out Moiraine was Aes Sedai. You nearly soiled yourself every time
anybody even mentioned the Power. What are you doing in Tar Valon, with Aes Sedai on every
side?”
“I am leaving Tar Valon. That’s what I am doing here. Leaving!” Mat grimaced. The gleeman
had saved his life, and maybe more. A Fade had been involved. That was why Thom’s right leg did

not work as well as it should. There could not be enough wine on a ship to keep him this drunk. “I
am going to Caemlyn, Thom. If you need to risk your fool life for some reason, why not come with
me?”
“Caemlyn?” Thom said musingly.
“Caemlyn, Thom. Elaida will likely be going back there sooner or later, so you’d have her to
worry about. And from what I remember, if Morgase puts her hands on you, you will wish Elaida had
you.”
“Caemlyn. Yes. Caemlyn would fit my mood like a glove.” The gleeman glanced at the chicken
platter and gave a start. “What did you do, boy? Stuff them up your sleeve?” There was nothing left of
the three birds but bones and carcasses with only a few strips of flesh remaining.
“Sometimes I get hungry,” Mat muttered. It was an effort not to lick his fingers. “Are you coming
with me, or not?”
“Oh, I will come, boy.” As Thom pushed himself to his feet, he did not seem as unsteady as he
had been. “You wait here—and try not to eat the table—while I get my things and say some
goodbyes.” He limped away, not staggering once.
Mat drank a little of his wine and stripped off a few shreds that were left on the chicken
carcasses, wondering if he had time to order another, but Thom was back quickly. His harp and flute
in their dark leather cases hung on his back with a tied blanketroll. He carried a plain walking staff as
tall as he was. The two serving women followed on either side. Mat decided they were sisters.
Identical big brown eyes looked up at the gleeman with identical expressions. Thom was kissing first
Saal, then Mada, and patting cheeks as he headed for the door, jerking his head for Mat to follow. He
was outside before Mat could finish collecting his own belongings and pick up his quarterstaff.
The younger of the two women, Saal, stopped Mat as he reached the door. “Whatever you said
to him, I forgive you for the wine, even if it is taking him away. I’ve not seen him this alive in
weeks.” She pressed something into his hand, and when he glanced at it, his eyes widened in
confusion. She had given him a silver Tar Valon mark. “For whatever it was you said. Besides,
whoever is feeding you is not doing a good job of it, but you still have pretty eyes.” She laughed at the
expression on his face.
Mat was laughing, too, in spite of himself, as he went out into the street, rolling the silver coin
across the backs of his fingers. So I have pretty eyes, do I? His laughter shut off like the last drip
from a wine barrel: Thom was there, but not the corpse. The windows of the taverns down the street
put enough light across the cobblestones for him to be sure of it. The city guard would not have
carried a dead man away without asking questions, at those taverns and at The Woman of Tanchico,
too.
“What are you staring at, boy?” Thom asked. “No Trollocs in those shadows.”
“Footpads,” Mat muttered. “I was thinking about footpads.”
“No street thieves or strong-arms in Tar Valon, either, boy. When the guards take a footpad—not
that many try that game here; the word spreads—but when they do, they haul him to the Tower, and
whatever it is the Aes Sedai do to him, the fellow leaves Tar Valon the next day as wide-eyed as a
goosed girl. I understand they’re even harder on women caught thieving. No, the only way you’ll have
your money stolen here is somebody selling you polished brass for gold or using shaved dice. There
are no footpads.”
Mat turned on his heel and strode past Thom, heading toward the docks, quarterstaff thumping off
the cobblestones as if he could push himself ahead faster. “We’re going to be on the first ship sailing,
whatever it is. The first, Thom.”

Thom’s stick clicked hurriedly after him. “Slow down, boy. What’s your hurry? There are plenty
of ships, sailing day and night. Slow down. There aren’t any footpads.”
“The first bloody ship, Thom! If it’s sinking, we’ll be on it!” If they weren’t footpads, what
were they? They had to be thieves. What else could they be?

CHAPTER
32

The First Ship

Southharbor itself, the great Ogier-made basin, was huge and round, surrounded by high walls
of the same silver-streaked white stone as the rest of Tar Valon. One long wharf, most of it roofed,
ran all the way around, except where the wide water gates stood open to give access to the river.
Vessels of every size lined the wharf, most moored by the stern, and despite the hour dockmen in
coarse, sleeveless shirts hurried about loading and unloading bales and chests, crates and barrels,
with ropes and booms, or on their backs. Lamps hanging from the roof beams lit the wharfs and made
a band of light around the black water in the middle of the harbor. Small open boats scuttled through
the darkness, the square lanterns atop their tall sternposts making it seem as if fireflies skittered
across the harbor. They were small only compared to the ships, though; some had as many as six pairs
of long oars.
When Mat led a still-muttering Thom under an arch of polished redstone and down broad steps
to the wharf, crewmen on one three-masted ship were unfastening the mooring lines not twenty paces
away. The vessel was larger than most Mat could see, between fifteen and twenty spans from sharp
bow to squared stern, with a flat, railed deck almost level with the wharf. The important thing was
that it was casting off. The first ship that sails.
A gray-haired man came up the wharf: three lines of hemp rope sewn down the sleeves of his
dark coat marked him as a dockmaster. His wide shoulders suggested that he might have begun as a
dockman hauling rope instead of wearing it. He glanced casually in Mat’s direction, and stopped,
surprise on his leathery face. “Your bundles say what you’re planning, lad, but you might as well
forget it. The sister showed me a drawing of you. You’ll board no ship in Southharbor, lad. Go back
up those stairs so I don’t have to tell a man off to watch you.”
“What under the Light . . . ?” Thom murmured.
“That’s all changed,” Mat said firmly. The ship was casting off the last mooring line; the furled
triangular sails still made thick, pale bundles on the long, slanted booms, but men were readying the
sweeps. He pulled the Amyrlin’s paper out of his pouch and thrust it in the dockmaster’s face. “As
you can see, I’m on the business of the Tower, at the order of the Amyrlin Seat herself. And I have to
leave on that very vessel there.”
The dockmaster read the words, then read them again. “I never saw such a thing in my life. Why
would the Tower say you couldn’t go, then give you . . . that?”
“Ask the Amyrlin, if you want,” Mat told him in a weary voice that said he did not think anyone
could possibly be stupid enough to do that, “but she’ll have my hide, and yours, if I do not sail on that
ship.”
“You’ll never make it,” the dockmaster said, but he was already cupping his hands to his mouth.
“Aboard the Gray Gull there! Stop! The Light burn you, stop!”

The shirtless fellow at the tiller looked back, then spoke to a tall companion in a dark coat with
puffy sleeves. The tall man never took his eyes off the crewmen just dipping the sweeps into the
water. “Give way together,” he called, and sweepblades curled up froth.
“I’ll make it,” Mat snapped. The first ship I said, and the first ship I meant! “Come on, Thom!”
Without waiting to see if the gleeman followed, he ran down the wharf, dodging around men and
barrows stacked with cargo. The gap between the Gray Gull’s stern and the wharf widened as the
sweeps bit deeper. Hefting his quarterstaff, he hurled it ahead of him toward the ship like a spear,
took one more step, and jumped as hard as he could.
The dark water passing beneath his feet looked icy, but in a heartbeat he had cleared the ship’s
rail and was rolling across the deck. As he scrambled to his feet, he heard a grunt and a curse behind
him.
Thom Merrilin hoisted himself up on the railing with another curse, and climbed over onto the
deck. “I lost my stick,” he muttered. “I’ll want another.” Rubbing his right leg, he peered down at the
still widening strip of water behind the vessel and shivered. “I had a bath today already.” The
shirtless steersman stared wide-eyed from him to Mat and back again, clutching the tiller as if
wondering whether he could use it to defend himself from madmen.
The tall man seemed nearly as stunned. His pale blue eyes bulged, and his mouth worked
soundlessly for a moment. His dark beard, cut to a point, seemed to quiver with rage, and his narrow
face grew purple. “By the Stone!” he bellowed finally. “What is the meaning of this? I’ve no room on
this vessel for as much as a ship’s cat, and I’d not take vagabonds who leap onto my decks if I did.
Sanor! Vasa! Heave this rubbish over the side!” Two extremely large men, barefoot and stripped to
the waist, straightened from coiling lines and started toward the stern. The men at the sweeps
continued their work, bending to lift the blades, taking three long steps along the deck, then
straightening and walking backwards, hauling the ship ahead on their blades.
Mat waved the Amyrlin’s paper toward the bearded man—the captain, he supposed—with one
hand, and fished a gold crown out of his pouch with the other, taking care even in his haste that the
fellow saw there were more where that came from. Tossing the heavy coin to the man, he spoke
quickly, still waving the paper. “For the inconvenience of our boarding as we did, Captain. More to
come for passage. On business of the White Tower. Personal command of the Amyrlin Seat.
Imperative we sail immediately. To Aringill, in Andor. Utmost urgency. The blessings of the White
Tower on all who aid us; the Tower’s wrath on any who impede us.”
Certain the man had seen the Flame of Tar Valon seal by that time—and little more, Mat hoped
—he folded the paper again and thrust it back out of sight. Eyeing the two big men uneasily as they
came up on either side of the captain—Burn me, they both have arms like Perrin’s!—he wished he
had his quarterstaff in hand. He could see it lying where it had landed, further down the deck. He tried
to look sure and confident, the sort of man others had better not trifle with, a man with the power of
the White Tower behind him. A long way behind me, I hope.
The captain looked at Mat doubtfully, and even more so at Thom in his gleeman’s cloak and
none too steady afoot, but he motioned Sanor and Vasa to stop where they were. “I would not anger
the Tower. Burn my soul, for the time being the river trade takes me from Tear to this den of. . . . I
come too often to anger . . . anyone.” A tight smile appeared on his face. “But I spoke the truth. By the
Stone, I did! Six cabins I have for passengers, and all full. You can sleep on deck and eat with the
crew for another gold crown. Each.”
“That is ridiculous!” Thom snapped. “I don’t care what the war has done downriver, that is
ridiculous!” The two large sailors shifted their bare feet.

“It is the price,” the captain said firmly. “I do not want to anger anyone, but I’d as soon not have
any business you can be on aboard my vessel. Like letting a man pay you so he can coat you with hot
tar, mixing in that business. You pay the price, or you go over the side, and the Amyrlin Seat herself
can dry you off. And I’ll keep this for the trouble you’ve given me, thank you.” He stuffed the gold
crown Mat has tossed him into a pocket of his puffy-sleeved coat.
“How much for one of the cabins?” Mat asked. “To ourselves. You can put whoever is in it now
with someone else.” He did not want to sleep out in the cold night. And if you don’t overwhelm a
fellow like this, he’ll steal your breeches and say he is doing you a favor. His stomach rumbled
loudly. “And we eat what you eat, not with the crew. And plenty of it!”
“Mat,” Thom said, “I’m the one who is supposed to be drunk here.” He turned to the captain,
flourishing his patch-covered cloak as well as he could with blanketroll and instrument cases hung
about him. “As you may have noticed, Captain, I am a gleeman.” Even in the open air, his voice
suddenly seemed to echo. “For the price of our passages, I would be more than glad to entertain your
passengers and your crew—”
“My crew is aboard to work, gleeman, not be entertained.” The captain stroked his pointed
beard; his pale eyes priced Mat’s plain coat to the copper. “So you want a cabin, do you?” He barked
a laugh. “And my meals? Well, you can have my cabin and my meals. For five gold crowns from each
of you! Andoran weight!” Those were the heaviest. He began to laugh so hard his words came out in
wheezes. Flanking him, Sanor and Vasa grinned wide grins. “For ten crowns, you can take my cabin,
and my meals, and I’ll move in with the passengers and eat with the crew. Burn my soul, I will! By
the Stone, I swear it! For ten gold crowns. . . .” Laughter choked off anything else.
He was still laughing and gasping for breath and wiping tears from his eyes when Mat pulled out
one of his two purses, but laughter stopped by the time Mat had counted five crowns into his hands.
The captain blinked in disbelief; the two big crewmen looked poleaxed.
“Andoran weight, you said?” Mat asked. It was hard to judge without scales, but he laid seven
more on the pile. Two actually were Andoran, and he thought the others made up the weight. Close
enough, for this fellow. After a moment, he added another two gold Tairen crowns. “For whoever
you’ll be pushing out of the cabin they paid for.” He did not think the passengers would see a copper
of it, but it sometimes paid to appear generous. “Unless you mean to share with them? No, of course
not. They ought to have something for having to crowd in with others. There’s no need for you to eat
with your crew, Captain. You are welcome to share Thom’s meals and mine in your cabin.” Thom
stared at him as hard as the others did.
“Are you . . . ?” The bearded man’s voice was a hoarse whisper. “Are you . . . by any chance
. . . a young lord in disguise?”
“I am no lord.” Mat laughed. He had reason to laugh. The Gray Gull was well out into the
darkness of the harbor, now, with the wharf a band of light pointing up the black gap, not far ahead
now, where the water gates let out onto the river. The sweeps drove the vessel toward that gap
quickly. Men were already swinging the long, slanting booms around preparatory to unlashing the
sails. And with gold in his hands, the captain no longer seemed ready to throw anyone overboard. “If
you don’t mind, Captain, could we see our cabin? Your cabin, I mean. It’s late, and I for one want a
few hours’ sleep.” His stomach spoke to him. “And supper!”
As the vessel put its bow into the blackness, the bearded man himself led the way down a ladder
to a short, narrow passage lined with doors set close together. While the captain cleared his things
from his cabin—it ran the width of the stern, with its bed and all of its furnishings built into the walls
except two chairs and a few chests—and saw that Mat and Thom were settled, Mat learned a great

deal, beginning with the fact that the man would not be pushing any passengers out of their quarters.
He had too much respect for the coin they had paid, if not for them, to allow that. The captain would
take his first’s cabin, and that officer would take the second’s bed, pushing each lower man down till
the deckmaster would end sleeping up in the bow with the crew.
Mat did not think that information could be very useful, but he listened to everything the man
said. It was always best to know not only where you were going, but who you were dealing with, or
they might just take your coat and boots and leave you to walk home through the rain in bare feet.
The captain was a Tairen named Huan Mallia, and he spoke with great volubility once he had
worked out Mat and Thom to his own satisfaction. He was not nobly born, he said, not him, but he
would not have anyone think he was a fool. A young man with more gold than any young man should
have by right might be a thief, if everyone did not know thieves never escaped Tar Valon with their
haul. A young man dressed like a farmboy but with the air and confidence of the lord he denied being
—“By the Stone, I’ll not say you are, if you say you are not.” Mallia winked and chuckled and tugged
the point of his beard. A young man carrying a paper bearing the Amyrlin Seat’s seal and bound for
Andor. There was no secret that Queen Morgase had visited Tar Valon, though her reason certainly
was. It was obvious to Mallia something was afoot between Caemlyn and Tar Valon. And Mat and
Thom were messengers—for Morgase, he thought, by Mat’s accent. Anything he could do to help in
so great an enterprise would be his pleasure, not that he meant to poke where he was not wanted.
Mat exchanged startled looks with Thom, who was stowing his instrument cases under a table
built out from one wall. The room had two small windows on either side, and a pair of lamps in
jointed brackets for light. “That’s nonsense,” Mat said.
“Of course,” Mallia replied. He straightened from pulling clothes out of a chest at the foot of the
bed and smiled. “Of course.” A cupboard in the wall seemed to hold charts of the river he would
need. “I’ll say no more.”
But he did mean to poke, though he attempted to disguise it, and he rambled while he tried to pry.
Mat listened, and answered the questions with grunts or shrugs or a word or two, while Thom said
less than that. The gleeman kept shaking his head while unburdening himself of his possessions.
Mallia had been a river man all his life, though he dreamed of sailing on the sea. He hardly
spoke of a country beside Tear without contempt; Andor was the only one to escape, and the praise he
finally managed was grudging despite his obvious efforts. “Good horses in Andor, I’ve heard. Not
bad. Not as good as Tairen stock, but good enough. You make good steel, and iron goods, bronze and
copper—I’ve traded for them often enough, though you charge a weighty price—but then you have
those mines in the Mountains of Mist. Gold mines, too. We have to earn our gold, in Tear.”
Mayene received his greatest contempt. “Even less a country than Murandy is. One city and a
few leagues of land. They underprice the oil from our good Tairen olives just because their ships
know how to find the oilfish shoals. They’ve no right to be a country at all.”
He hated Illian. “One day we’ll loot Illian bare, tear down every town and village, and sow
their filthy ground with salt.” Mallia’s beard almost bristled with outrage at how filthy the Illian land
was. “Even their olives are putrid! One day we’ll carry every last Illianer pig off in chains! That is
what the High Lord Samon says.”
Mat wondered what the man thought Tear would do with all those people if they actually
fulfilled this scheme. The Illianers would have to be fed, and they would surely do no work in chains.
It made no sense to him, but Mallia’s eyes shone when he spoke of it.
Only fools let themselves be ruled by a king or a queen, by one man or woman. “Except Queen
Morgase, of course,” he put in hastily. “She is a fine woman, so I’ve heard. Beautiful, I’m told.” All

those fools bowing to one fool. The High Lords ruled Tear together, reaching decisions in concert,
and that was how things should be. The High Lords knew what was right and good and true.
Especially the High Lord Samon. No man could go wrong obeying the High Lords. Especially the
High Lord Samon.
Beyond kings and queens, beyond even Illian, lay a bigger hatred Mallia attempted to keep
hidden, but he talked so much in trying to find out what they were up to, and grew so carried away by
the sound of his own voice, that he let more slip than he intended.
They must travel a great deal, serving a great Queen like Morgase. They must have seen many
lands. He dreamed of the sea because then he could see lands he had only heard of, because then he
could find the Mayener oilfish shoals, could out-trade the Sea Folk and the filthy Illianers. And the
sea was far from Tar Valon. They must understand that, forced as they were to travel among odd
places and people, places and people they could not have stomached if they were not serving Queen
Morgase.
“I never liked docking there, never knowing who might be using the Power.” He almost spat the
last word. Since he had heard the High Lord Samon speak, though. . . . “Burn my soul, it makes me
feel like hullworms are burrowing into my belly just looking at their White Tower, now, knowing
what they plan.”
The High Lord Samon said the Aes Sedai meant to rule the world. Samon said they meant to
crush every nation, put their foot on every man’s throat. Samon said Tear could no longer hold the
Power out of its own lands and believe that was enough. Samon said Tear had its rightful day of glory
coming, but Tar Valon stood between Tear and glory.
“There’s no hope for it. Sooner or later they will have to be hunted down and killed, every last
Aes Sedai. The High Lord Samon says the others might be saved—the young ones, the novices, the
Accepted—if they’re brought to the Stone, but the rest must be eradicated. That’s what the High Lord
Samon says. The White Tower must be destroyed.”
For a moment Mallia stood in the middle of his cabin, arms full of clothes and books and rolled
charts, hair almost brushing the deck beams overhead, staring at nothing with pale blue eyes while the
White Tower tumbled into ruin. Then he gave a start as if realizing what he had just said. His pointed
beard waggled uncertainly.
“That is . . . that’s what he says. I . . . I think that may be going too far, myself. The High Lord
Samon. . . . He speaks so that he carries a man beyond his own beliefs. If Caemlyn can make
covenants with the Tower, why, so can Tear.” He shivered and did not seem to know it. “That is what
I say.”
“As you say,” Mat told him, and felt mischief bubble inside. “I think your suggestion is the right
one, Captain. But don’t stop with a few Accepted, though. Ask a dozen Aes Sedai to come, or two.
Think what the Stone of Tear would be like with two dozen Aes Sedai in it.”
Mallia shuddered. “I will send a man for my money chest,” he said stiffly, and stalked out.
Mat frowned at the closed door. “I think I shouldn’t have said that.”
“I don’t know why you might think that,” Thom said dryly. “Next you could try telling the Lord
Captain Commander of the Whitecloaks he should marry the Amyrlin Seat.” His brows drew down,
like white caterpillars. “High Lord Samon. I never heard of any High Lord Samon.”
It was Mat’s turn to be dry. “Well, even you cannot know everything about all the kings and
queens and nobles there are, Thom. One or two might just have escaped your notice.”
“I know the names of the kings and queens, boy, and the names of all the High Lords of Tear, too.
I suppose they could have raised a Lord of the Land, but I’d think I would have heard of the old High

Lord dying. If you had settled for booting some poor fellows out of their cabin instead of taking the
captain’s, we’d each have a bed to ourselves, narrow and hard as it might be. Now we have to share
Mallia’s. I hope you don’t snore, boy. I cannot abide snoring.”
Mat ground his teeth. As he recalled, Thom had a snore like a wood-rasp working on an oak
knot. He had forgotten that.
It was one of the two large men—Sanor or Vasa; he did not give his name—who came to pull
the captain’s iron-bound money chest from under the bed. He never said a word, only made sketchy
bows, and frowned at them when he thought they were not looking, and left.
Mat was beginning to wonder if the luck that had been with him all night had deserted him at
last. He was going to have to put up with Thom’s snoring, and truth to tell, it might not have been the
best luck in the world to jump onto this particular ship waving a paper signed by the Amyrlin Seat
and sealed with the Flame of Tar Valon. On impulse he pulled out one of his cylindrical leather dice
cups, popped off the tight-fitting lid, and upended the dice onto the table.
They were spotted dice, and five single pips stared up at him. The Dark One’s Eyes, that was
called in some games. It was a losing toss in those, a winning in other games. But what game am I
playing? He scooped the dice up, tossed them again. Five pips. Another toss, and again the Dark
One’s Eyes winked at him.
“If you used those dice to win all that gold,” Thom said quietly, “no wonder you had to leave by
the first ship sailing.” He had stripped down to his shirt, and had that half over his head when he
spoke. His knees were knobby and his legs seemed all sinew and stringy muscle, the right a little
shrunken. “Boy, a twelve-year-old girl would cut your heart out if she knew you were using dice like
that against her.”
“It isn’t the dice,” Mat muttered. “It’s the luck.” Aes Sedai luck? Or the Dark One’s luck? He
pushed the dice back into the cup and capped it.
“I suppose,” Thom said, climbing into the bed, “you aren’t going to tell me where all that gold
came from, then.”
“I won it. Tonight. With their dice.”
“Uh-huh. And I suppose you’re not going to explain that paper you were waving around—I saw
the seal, boy!—or all that talk about White Tower business, or why the dockmaster had your
description from an Aes Sedai, either.”
“I am carrying a letter to Morgase for Elayne, Thom,” Mat said a good deal more patiently than
he felt. “Nynaeve gave me the paper. I don’t know where she got it.”
“Well, if you are not going to tell me, I am going to sleep. Blow out the lamps, will you?” Thom
rolled on his side and pulled a pillow over his head.
Even after Mat had stripped off down to his smallclothes and crawled under the blankets—after
blowing out the lamps—he could not sleep, though Mallia had done well by himself with a good
feather mattress. He had been right about Thom’s snoring, and that pillow muffled nothing. It sounded
as if Thom were cutting wood cross-grain with a rusty saw. And he could not stop thinking. How had
Nynaeve and Egwene, and Elayne, gotten that paper from the Amyrlin? They had to be involved with
the Amyrlin Seat herself—in some plot, one of those White Tower machinations—but now that he
thought about it, they had to be holding something back from the Amyrlin, too.
“ ‘Please carry a letter to my mother, Mat,’ ” he said softly, in a high-pitched, mocking voice.
“Fool! The Amyrlin would have sent a Warder with any letter from the Daughter-Heir to the Queen.
Blind fool, wanting to get out of the Tower so bad I couldn’t see it.” Thom’s snore seemed to trumpet
agreement.

Most of all, though, he thought about luck, and footpads.
The first bump of something against the stern barely registered on him. He paid no attention to a
thump and scuffle from the deck overhead, or the tread of boots. The vessel itself made enough
noises, and there had to be someone on deck for the ship to make its way downriver. But stealthy
footsteps in the passageway leading to his door merged with thoughts of footpads and made his ears
prick up.
He nudged Thom in the ribs with an elbow. “Wake up,” he said softly. “There’s somebody
outside in the hall.” He was already easing himself off the bed, hoping the cabin floor—Deck, floor,
whatever it bloody is!—would not creak under his feet. Thom grunted, smacked his lips, and resumed
snoring.
There was no time to worry about Thom. The footsteps were right outside. Taking up his
quarterstaff, Mat placed himself in front of the door and waited.
The door swung open slowly, and two cloaked men, one behind the other, were faintly outlined
by dim moonlight through the hatch at the top of the ladder they had crept down. The moonlight was
enough to glint off bare knife blades. Both men gasped; they obviously had not expected to find
anyone waiting for them.
Mat thrust with the quarterstaff, catching the first man hard right under where his ribs joined
together. He heard his father’s voice as he struck. It’s a killing blow, Mat. Don’t ever use it unless
it’s your life. But those knives made it for his life; there was no room in the cabin for swinging a
staff.
Even as the man made a choking sound and folded toward the deck, fighting vainly for breath,
Mat stepped forward and drove the end of the quarterstaff over him into the second man’s throat with
a loud crunch. That fellow dropped his knife to clutch at his throat, and fell on top of his companion,
both of them scraping their boots across the deck, death rattles already sounding in their throats.
Mat stood there, staring down at them. Two men. No, burn me, three! I don’t think I ever hurt
another human being before, and now I’ve killed three men in one night. Light!
Silence filled the dark passageway, and he heard the thump of boots on the deck overhead. The
crewmen all went barefoot.
Trying not to think about what he was doing, Mat ripped the cloak from one of the dead men and
settled it around his shoulders, hiding the pale linen of his smallclothes. On bare feet he padded down
the passage and climbed the ladder, barely sticking his eyes above the hatch coping.
Pale moonlight reflected off the taut sails, but night still covered the deck with shadows, and
there was no sound except the rush of water along the vessel’s sides. Only one man at the tiller, the
hood of his cloak pulled up against the chill, seemed to be on deck. The man shifted, and boot leather
scuffed on the deck planks.
Holding the quarterstaff low and hoping it would not be noticed, Mat climbed on up. “He’s
dead,” he muttered in a low, rough whisper.
“I hope he squealed when you cut his throat.” The heavily accented voice was one Mat
remembered calling from the mouth of a twisting street in Tar Valon. “This boy, he causes us too
much of the trouble, Wait! Who are you?”
Mat swung the staff with all his strength. The thick wood smashed into the man’s head, the hood
of his cloak only partly muffling a sound like a melon hitting the floor.
The man fell across the tiller, shoving it over, and the vessel lurched, staggering Mat. Out of the
corner of his eye he saw a shape rising out of the shadows by the railing, and the gleam of a blade,
and he knew he would never get his staff around before it struck home. Something else that shone

streaked through the night and merged with the dim shape with a dull thunk. The rising motion became
a fall, and a man sprawled almost at Mat’s feet.
A babble of voices rose belowdecks as the ship swung again, the tiller shifting with the first
man’s weight.
Thom limped from the hatch in cloak and smallclothes, raising the shutter on a bull’s-eye lantern.
“You were lucky, boy. One of those below had this lantern. Could have set the ship on fire, lying
there.” The light showed a knife hilt sticking up from the chest of a man with dead, staring eyes. Mat
had never seen him before; he was sure he would have remembered someone with that many scars on
his face. Thom kicked a dagger away from the dead man’s outflung hand, then bent to retrieve his own
knife, wiping the blade on the corpse’s cloak. “Very lucky, boy. Very lucky indeed.”
There was a rope tied to the stern rail. Thom stepped over to it, shining the light down astern,
and Mat joined him. At the other end of the rope was one of the small boats from Southharbor, its
square lantern extinguished. Two more men stood among the pulled-in oars.
“The Great Lord take me, it’s him!” one of them gasped. The other darted forward to work
frantically at the knot holding the rope.
“You want to kill these two as well?” Thom asked, his voice booming as it did when he
performed.
“No, Thom,” Mat said quietly. “No.”
The men in the boat must have heard the question and not the answer, for they abandoned the
attempt to free their boat and leaped over the side with great splashes. The sound of them thrashing
away across the river was loud.
“Fools,” Thom muttered. “The river narrows somewhat after Tar Valon, but it must still be half
a mile or more wide here. They’ll never make it in the dark.”
“By the Stone!” came a shout from the hatch. “What happens here? There are dead men in the
passageway! What’s Vasa doing lying on the tiller? He’ll run us onto a mudbank!” Naked save for
linen underbreeches, Mallia dashed to the tiller, hauling the dead man off roughly as he pulled the
long lever to put the course straight again. “That isn’t Vasa! Burn my soul, who are all these dead
men?” Others were clambering on deck now, barefoot crewmen and frightened passengers wrapped
in cloaks and blankets.
Shielding his actions with his body, Thom slipped his knife under the rope and severed it in one
stroke. The small boat began falling back into the darkness. “River brigands, Captain,” he said.
“Young Mat and I have saved your vessel from river brigands. They might have cut everyone’s throat
if not for us. Perhaps you should reconsider your passage fee.”
“Brigands!” Mallia exclaimed. “There are plenty of those down around Cairhien, but I never
heard of it this far north!” The huddled passengers began to mutter about brigands and having their
throats cut.
Mat walked stiffly to the hatch. Behind him, he heard Mallia. “He’s a cold one. I never heard
that Andor employed assassins, but burn my soul, he is a cold one.”
Mat stumbled down the ladder, stepped over the two bodies in the passage, and slammed the
door of the captain’s cabin behind him. He made it halfway to the bed before the shaking hit him, and
then all he could do was sink down on his knees. Light, what game am I playing in? I have to know
the game if I’m going to win. Light, what game?
Playing “Rose of the Morning” softly on his flute, Rand peered into his campfire, where a rabbit
was roasting on a stick slanting over the flames. A night wind made the flames flicker; he barely

noticed the smell of the rabbit, though a vagrant thought did come that he needed to find more salt in
the next village or town. “Rose of the Morning” was one of the tunes he had played at those
weddings.
How many days ago was that? Were there really so many, or did I imagine it? Every woman
in the village deciding to marry at once? What was its name? Am I going mad already?
Sweat beaded on his face, but he played on, barely loud enough to be heard, staring into the fire.
Moiraine had told him he was ta’veren. Everyone said he was ta’veren. Maybe he really was.
People like that—changed—things around them. A ta’veren might have caused all those weddings.
But that was too close to something he did not want to think about.
They say I’m the Dragon Reborn, too. They all say it. The living say it, and the dead. That
doesn’t make it true. I had to let them proclaim me. Duty. I had no choice, but that does not make
it true.
He could not seem to stop playing that one tune. It made him think of Egwene. He had thought
once that he would marry Egwene. A long time ago, that seemed. That was gone, now. She had come
in his dreams, though. It might have been her. Her face. It was her face.
Only, there had been so many faces, faces he knew. Tam, and his mother, and Mat, and Perrin.
All trying to kill him. It had not really been them, of course. Only their faces, on Shadowspawn. He
thought it had not really been them. Even in his dreams it seemed the Shadowspawn walked. Were
they only dreams? Some dreams were real, he knew. And others were only dreams, nightmares, or
hopes. But how to tell the difference? Min had walked his dreams one night—and tried to plant a
knife in his back. He was still surprised at how much that had pained him. He had been careless, let
her come close, let down his guard. Around Min, he had not felt any need to be on his guard in so
long, despite the things she saw when she looked at him. Being with her had been like having balm
soothed into his wounds.
And then she tried to kill me! The music rose to a discordant screech, but he pulled it back to
softness. Not her. Shadowspawn with her face. Least of them all would Min hurt me. He could not
understand why he thought that, but he was sure it was true.
So many faces in his dreams. Selene had come, cool and mysterious and so lovely his mouth
went dry just thinking of her, offering him glory as she had—so long ago, it seemed—but now it was
the sword she said he had to take. And with the sword would come Selene. Callandor. That was
always in his dreams. Always. And taunting faces. Hands, pushing Egwene, and Nynaeve, and Elayne
into cages, snaring them in nets, hurting them. Why should he weep more for Elayne than for the other
two?
His head spun. His head hurt as much as his side, and sweat rolled down his face, and he softly
played “Rose of the Morning” through the night, fearing to sleep. Fearing to dream.

Within the Weave

From his saddle, Perrin frowned down at the flat stone half hidden in weeds by the roadside.
This road of hard-packed dirt, already called the Lugard Road now they were near the
Manetherendrelle and the border of Murandy, had been paved once, long in the past, so Moiraine had
said two days earlier, and bits of paving stone still worked their way to the surface from time to time.
This one had an odd marking on it.
If dogs had been able to make footprints on stone, he would have said it was the print of a large
hound. There were no hound’s footprints in any of the bare ground he could see, where softer dirt on
the verge might take one, and no smell of any dog’s trail. Just a faint trace in the air of something
burned, almost the sulphurous smell left by setting off fireworks. There was a town ahead, where the
road struck the river; maybe some children had sneaked out here with some of the Illuminators’
handiwork.
A long way yet for children to sneak. But he had seen farms. It could have been farm children.
Whatever it is, it has nothing to do with that marking. Horses don’t fly, and dogs don’t make
footprints on stone. I’m getting too tired to think straight.
Yawning, he dug his heels into Stepper’s ribs, and the dun broke into a gallop after the others.
Moiraine had been pushing them hard since leaving Jarra, and there was no waiting for anyone who
stopped for even a moment. When the Aes Sedai put her mind on something, she was as hard as cold
hammered iron. Loial had given up reading as he rode six days earlier, after looking up to find
himself left a mile behind and everyone else almost out of sight over the next hill.
Perrin slowed Stepper alongside the Ogier’s big horse, behind Moiraine’s white mare, and
yawned again. Lan was up ahead somewhere, scouting. The sun behind them stood no more than an
hour above the treetops, but the Warder had said they would reach a town called Remen, on the
Manetherendrelle, before dark. Perrin was not sure he wanted to see what awaited them there. He did
not know what it might be, but the days since Jarra had made him wary.
“I don’t see why you can’t sleep,” Loial told him. “I am so tired by the time she lets us halt for
the night, I fall asleep before I can lie down.”
Perrin only shook his head. There was no way to explain to Loial that he did not dare sleep
soundly, that even his lightest sleep was full of troubled dreams. Like that odd one with Egwene and
Hopper in it. Well, no wonder I dream about her. Light, I wonder how she is. Safe in the Tower by
now, and learning how to be Aes Sedai. Verin will look after her, and after Mat, too. He did not
think anyone needed to look after Nynaeve; around Nynaeve, to his mind, other people needed
someone to look after them.
He did not want to think about Hopper. He was succeeding in keeping live wolves out of his
head, although at the price of feeling as if he had been hammered-and-drawn by a hasty hand; he did

not want to think a dead wolf might be creeping in. He shook himself and forced his eyes wide open.
Not even Hopper.
There had been more reasons than bad dreams not to sleep well. They had found other signs left
by Rand’s passage. Between Jarra and the River Boern there had been none Perrin could see, but
when they crossed the Boern by a stone bridge arching from one fifty-foot river cliff to another, they
had left behind a town called Sidon all in ashes. Every building. Only a few stone walls and
chimneys still stood among the ruins.
Bedraggled townspeople said a lantern dropped in a barn had started it, and then the fire seemed
to run wild, and everything went wrong. Half the buckets that could be found had holes in them. Every
last burning wall had fallen outward instead of in, setting houses to either side alight. Flaming timbers
from the inn had somehow tumbled as far as the main well in the square, so no one could draw more
water from it to fight the fires, and houses had fallen right on top of three other wells. Even the wind
had seemed to shift, fanning the flames in every direction.
There had been no need to ask Moiraine if Rand’s presence had caused it; her face, like cold
iron, was answer enough. The Pattern shaped itself around Rand, and chance ran wild.
Beyond Sidon they had ridden through four small towns where only Lan’s tracking told them
Rand was still ahead. Rand was afoot, now, and had been for some time. They had found his horse
back beyond Jarra, dead, looking as if it had been mauled by wolves, or dogs run wild. It had been
hard for Perrin not to reach out, then, especially when Moiraine looked up from the horse to frown at
him. Luckily, Lan had found the tracks of Rand’s boots, running from where the dead horse lay. One
boot heel had a three-cornered gouge from a rock; it made his prints plain. But afoot or mounted, he
seemed to be staying ahead of them.
In the four villages after Sidon, the biggest excitement anyone could remember was seeing Loial
ride in, and discovering that he was an Ogier, for real and for true. They were so caught up with that,
that they barely even noticed Perrin’s eyes, and when they did. . . . Well, if Ogier were real, then men
could very well have any color eyes at all.
But after those came a little place named Willar, and it was celebrating. The spring on the
village common was flowing again, after a year of hauling water a mile from a stream when all
efforts at digging wells had failed and half the people had moved away. Willar would not die after
all. Three more untouched villages had been followed in quick succession, all in one day, by Samaha,
where every well in town had gone dry just the night before, and people were muttering about the
Dark One; then Tallan, where all the old arguments the village had ever known had bubbled to the
surface like overflowing cesspits a morning earlier, and it had taken three murders to shock everyone
back to his senses; and finally Fyall, where the crops this spring looked to be the poorest anyone
could remember, but the Mayor, digging a new privy behind his house, had found rotted leather sacks
full of gold, so none would go hungry. No one in Fyall recognized the fat coins, with a woman’s face
on one side and an eagle on the other; Moiraine said they had been minted in Manetheren.
Perrin had finally asked her about it, as they sat around their campfire one night. “After Jarra, I
thought. . . . They were all so happy, with their weddings. Even the Whitecloaks were only made to
look like fools. Fyall was all right—Rand couldn’t have had anything to do with their crops; they
were failing before he ever came, and that gold was surely good, with their need—but all this other.
. . . That town burning, and the wells failing, and. . . . That is evil, Moiraine. I can’t believe Rand is
evil. The Pattern may be shaping itself around him, but how can the Pattern be that evil? It makes no
sense, and things have to make sense. If you make a tool with no sense to it, it’s wasted metal. The
Pattern wouldn’t make waste.”

Lan gave him a wry look, and vanished into the darkness to make a circuit around their campsite.
Loial, already stretched out in his blankets, lifted his head to listen, ears pricking forward.
Moiraine was silent for a time, warming her hands. Finally she spoke while staring into the
flames. “The Creator is good, Perrin. The Father of Lies is evil. The Pattern of Age, the Age Lace
itself, is neither. The Pattern is what is. The Wheel of Time weaves all lives into the Pattern, all
actions. A pattern that is all one color is no pattern. For the Pattern of an Age, good and ill are the
warp and the woof.”
Even riding through late-afternoon sunshine three days later, Perrin felt the chill he had had on
first hearing her say those words. He wanted to believe the Pattern was good. He wanted to believe
that when men did evil things, they were going against the Pattern, distorting it. To him the Pattern
was a fine and intricate creation made by a master smith. That it mixed pot metal and worse in with
good steel with never a care was a cold thought.
“I care,” he muttered softly. “Light, I do care.” Moiraine glanced back at him, and he fell silent.
He was not sure what the Aes Sedai cared about, beyond Rand.
A few minutes later Lan appeared from ahead and swung his black war horse in beside
Moiraine’s mare. “Remen lies just over the next hill,” he said. “They have had an eventful day or
two, it seems.”
Loial’s ears twitched once. “Rand?”
The Warder shook his head. “I do not know. Perhaps Moiraine can say, when she sees.” The
Aes Sedai gave him a searching look, then heeled her white mare to a quicker step.
They topped the hill, and Remen lay spread out below them, hard against the river. The
Manetherendrelle stretched more than half a mile wide here, and there was no bridge, though two
crowded, barge like ferries crept across, propelled by long oars, and one nearly empty was returning.
Three more shared long stone docks with nearly a dozen river traders’ vessels, some with one mast,
some with two. A few bulky gray stone warehouses separated the docks from the town itself, where
the buildings seemed mostly of stone, as well, though roofed in tiles of every color from yellow to
red to purple, and the streets ran every which way around a central square.
Moiraine pulled up the deep hood of her cloak to hide her face before they rode down.
As usual, the people in the streets stared at Loial, but this time Perrin heard awed murmurs of
“Ogier.” Loial sat straighter in his saddle than he had in some time, and his ears stood straight, and a
smile just curled the ends of his wide mouth. He was obviously trying not to let on that he was
pleased, but he looked like a cat having its ears scratched.
Remen looked like any of a dozen towns to Perrin—it was full of man-made aromas and man
smell; with a strong smell of the river, of course—and he was wondering what Lan could have meant
when the hair on the back of his neck stirred as he scented something—wrong. As soon as his nose
took it in, it was gone like a horse hair dropped onto hot coals, but he remembered it. He had smelled
the same smell at Jarra, and it had vanished the same way, then. It was not a Twisted One or a
Neverborn—Trolloc, burn me, not a Twisted One! Not a Neverborn! A Myrddraal, a Fade, a
Halfman, anything but a Neverborn!—not a Trolloc or a Fade, yet the stench had been every bit as
sharp, every bit as vile. But whatever gave off that scent left no lasting trail, it seemed.
They rode into the town square. One of the big paving blocks had been pried up, right in the
middle of the square, so a gibbet could be erected. A single thick timber rose out of the dirt,
supporting a braced crosspiece from which hung an iron cage, the bottom of it four paces high. A tall
man dressed all in grays and browns sat in the cage, holding his knees under his chin. He had no room
to do otherwise. Three small boys were pitching stones at him. The man looked straight ahead, not

flinching when a stone made it between the bars. More than one trickle of blood stained his face. The
townspeople walking by paid no more mind to what the boys were doing than the man did, though
every last one of them looked at the cage, most of them with approval, and some with fear.
Moiraine made a sound in her throat that might have been disgust.
“There is more,” Lan said. “Come. I’ve already arranged rooms at an inn. I think you will find it
interesting.”
Perrin looked back over his shoulder at the caged man as he rode after them. There was
something familiar about the man, but he could not place it.
“They shouldn’t do that.” Loial’s rumble sounded halfway to a snarl. “The children, I mean. The
grown-ups should stop them.”
“They should,” Perrin agreed, barely paying attention. Why is he familiar?
The sign over the door of the inn Lan led them to, nearer the river, read Wayland’s Forge, which
Perrin took for a good omen, though there seemed to be nothing of the smithy about the place except
the leather-aproned man with a hammer painted on the sign. It was a large, purple-roofed, three-story
building of squared and polished gray stones, with large windows and scroll-carved doors, and it had
a prosperous look. Stablemen came running to take the horses, bowing even more deeply after Lan
tossed them coins.
Inside, Perrin stared at the people. The men and women at the tables were all dressed in their
feastday clothes, it seemed to him, with more embroidered coats, more lace on dresses, more colored
ribbons and fringed scarves, than he had seen in a long time. Only four men sitting at one table wore
plain coats, and they were the only ones who did not look up expectantly when Perrin and the others
walked in. The four men kept on talking softly. He could make out a little of what they were saying,
about the virtues of ice peppers over furs as cargo and what the troubles in Saldaea might have done
to prices. Captains of trading ships, he decided. The others seemed to be local folk. Even the serving
women appeared to be wearing their best, their long aprons covering embroidered dresses with bits
of lace at the neck.
The kitchen was working heavily; he could smell mutton, lamb, chicken, and beef, as well as
some sort of vegetables. And a spicy cake that made him forget meat for a moment.
The innkeeper himself met them just inside, a plump, bald-headed man with shining brown eyes
in a smooth pink face, bowing and dry-washing his hands. If he had not come to them, Perrin would
never have taken him for the landlord, for instead of the expected white apron, he wore a coat like
everyone else, all white-and-green embroidery on stout blue wool that had the man sweating with its
weight.
Why are they all wearing clothes for festival? Perrin wondered.
“Ah, Master Andra,” the innkeeper said, addressing Lan. “And an Ogier, just as you said. Not
that I doubted, of course. Not with all that’s happened, and never your word, master. Why not an
Ogier? Ah, friend Ogier, to be having you in the house gives me more pleasure than you can be
knowing. ’Tis a fine thing, and a fitting cap to it all. Ah, and mistress. . . .” His eyes took in the deep
blue silk of her dress and the rich wool of her cloak, dusty from travel but still fine. “Forgive me,
Lady, please.” His bow bent him like a horseshoe. “Master Andra did not make your station clear,
Lady. I meant no disrespect. You are even more welcome than friend Ogier here, of course, Lady.
Please, take no offense at Gainor Furlan’s poor tongue.”
“I take none.” Moiraine’s voice calmly accepted the title Furlan gave her. It was far from the
first time the Aes Sedai had gone under another name, or pretended to be something she was not. It
was not the first Perrin had heard Lan name himself Andra, either. The deep hood still hid Moiraine’s

smooth Aes Sedai features, and she held her cloak around her with one hand as if taken with a chill.
Not the hand on which she wore her Great Serpent ring. “You have had strange occurrences in the
town, innkeeper, so I understand. Nothing to trouble travelers, I trust.”
“Ah, Lady, you might be calling them strange indeed. Your own radiant presence is more than
enough to honor this humble house, Lady, and bringing an Ogier with you, but we have Hunters in
Remen, too. Right here in Wayland’s Forge, they are. Hunters for the Horn of Valere, set out from
Illian for adventure. And adventure they found, Lady, here in Remen, or just a mile or two upriver,
fighting wild Aielmen, of all things. Can you imagine black-veiled Aiel savages in Altara, Lady?”
Aiel. Now Perrin knew what was familiar about the man in the cage. He had seen an Aiel, once,
one of those fierce, nearly legendary denizens of the harsh land called the Waste. The man had looked
a good deal like Rand, taller than most, with gray eyes and reddish hair, and he had been dressed like
the man in the cage, all in browns and grays that would fade into rock or brush, with soft boots laced
to his knees. Perrin could almost hear Min’s voice again. An Aielman in a cage. A turning point in
your life, or something important that will happen.
“Why do you have . . . ?” He stopped to clear his throat so he would not sound so hoarse. “How
did an Aiel come to be caged in your town square?”
“Ah, young master, that is a story to. . . .” Furlan trailed off, eyeing him up and down, taking in
his plain country clothes and the longbow in his hands, pausing over the axe at his belt opposite his
quiver. The plump man gave a start when his study reached Perrin’s face, as if, with a Lady and an
Ogier present, he had just now noticed Perrin’s yellow eyes. “He would be your servant, Master
Andra?” he asked cautiously.
“Answer him,” was all Lan said.
“Ah. Ah, of course, Master Andra. But here’s who can tell it better than myself. ’Tis Lord
Orban, himself. ’Tis he we have gathered to hear.”
A dark-haired, youngish man in a red coat, with a bandage wound around his temples, was
making his way down the stairs at the side of the common room using padded crutches, the left leg of
his breeches cut away so more bandages could strap his calf from ankle to knee. The townspeople
murmured as if seeing something wondrous. The ship captains went on with their quiet talking; they
had come ’round to furs. Furlan might have thought the man in the red coat could tell the story better,
but he went ahead himself. “Lord Orban and Lord Gann faced twenty wild Aielmen with only ten
retainers. Ah, fierce was the fighting and hard, with many wounds given and received. Six good
retainers died, and every man took hurts, Lord Orban and Lord Gann worst of all, but every Aiel they
slew, save those who fled, and one they took prisoner. ’Tis that one you see out there in the square,
where he’ll not be troubling the countryside anymore with his savage ways, no more than the dead
ones will.”
“You have had trouble from Aiel in this district?” Moiraine asked.
Perrin was wondering the same thing, with no little consternation. If some people still
occasionally used “black-veiled Aiel” as a term for someone violent, it was testimony to the
impression the Aiel War had left, but that was twenty years in the past, now, and the Aiel had never
come out of the Waste before or since. But I saw one this side of the Spine of the World, and now
I’ve seen two.
The innkeeper rubbed at his bald head. “Ah. Ah, no, Lady, not exactly. But we would have had,
you can be sure, with twenty savages loose. Why, everyone remembers how they killed and looted
and burned their way across Cairhien. Men from this very village marched to the Battle of the Shining
Walls, when the nations gathered to throw them back. I myself suffered from a twisted back at the

time and so could not go, but I remember well, as we all do. How they came here, so far from their
own land, or why, I do not know, but Lord Orban and Lord Gann saved us from them.” There was a
murmur of agreement from the folk in feastday clothes.
Orban himself came stumping across the common room, not seeming to see anyone but the
innkeeper. Perrin could smell stale wine before he was even close. “Where’s that old woman taken
herself off to with her herbs, Furlan?” Orban demanded roughly. “Gann’s wounds are paining him,
and my head feels about to split open.”
Furlan almost bent his head to the floor. “Ah, Mother Leich will be back in the morning, Lord
Orban. A birthing, Lord. But she said she’d stitched and poulticed your wounds, and Lord Gann’s, so
there’d be no worrying. Ah, Lord Orban, I’m sure she’ll be seeing to you first thing on the morrow.”
The bandaged man muttered something under his breath—under his breath to any ears but
Perrin’s—about waiting on a farmwife “throwing her litter” and something else about being “sewn up
like a sack of meal.” He shifted sullen, angry eyes, and for the first time appeared to see the
newcomers. Perrin, he dismissed immediately, which did not surprise Perrin at all. His eyes widened
a little at Loial—He’s seen Ogier, Perrin thought, but he never thought to see one here—narrowed a
bit at Lan—He knows a fighting man when he sees one, and he does not like seeing one—and
brightened as he stooped to peer inside Moiraine’s hood, though he was not close enough to see her
face.
Perrin decided not to think anything at all about that, not concerning an Aes Sedai, and he hoped
neither Moiraine nor Lan thought anything of it, either. A light in the Warder’s eyes told him he had
missed on that hope, at least.
“Twelve of you fought twenty Aiel?” Lan asked in a flat voice.
Orban straightened, wincing. In an elaborately casual tone, he said, “Aye, you must expect things
such as that when you seek the Horn of Valere. It was not the first such encounter for Gann and me,
nor will it be the last before we find the Horn. If the Light shines on us.” He sounded as if the Light
could not possibly do anything else. “Not all our fights have been with Aiel, of course, but there are
always those who would stop Hunters, if they could. Gann and I, we do not stop easily.” Another
approving murmur came from the townspeople. Orban stood a little straighter.
“You lost six, and took one prisoner.” From Lan’s voice, it was not clear if that was a good
exchange or a poor one.
“Aye,” Orban said, “we slew the rest, save those who ran. No doubt they’re hiding their dead
now; I’ve heard they do that. The Whitecloaks are out searching for them, but they’ll never find them.”
“There are Whitecloaks here?” Perrin asked sharply.
Orban glanced at him, and dismissed him once more. The man addressed Lan again.
“Whitecloaks always put their noses in where they are not wanted or needed. Incompetent louts, all of
them. Aye, they’ll ride all over the countryside for days, but I doubt they’ll find as much as their own
shadows.”
“I suppose they won’t,” Lan said.
The bandaged man frowned as if unsure exactly what Lan meant, then rounded on the innkeeper
again. “You find that old woman, hear! My head is splitting.” With a last glance at Lan, he hobbled
away, climbing back up the stairs one at a time, followed by murmurs of admiration for a Hunter of
the Horn who had slain Aielmen.
“This is an eventful town.” Loial’s deep voice drew every eye to him. Except for the ship
captains, who seemed to be discussing rope, as near as Perrin could make out. “Everywhere I go, you
humans are doing things, hurrying and scurrying, having things happen to you. How can you stand so

much excitement?”
“Ah, friend Ogier,” Furlan said, “ ’tis the way of us humans to want excitement. How much I
regret not being able to march to the Shining Walls. Why, let me tell you—”
“Our rooms.” Moiraine did not raise her voice, but her words cut the innkeeper short like a
sharp knife. “Andra did arrange rooms, did he not?”
“Ah, Lady, forgive me. Yes, Master Andra did indeed hire rooms. Forgive me, please. ’Tis all
the excitement, makes my head empty itself. Please forgive me, Lady. This way, if you please. If
you’ll please to follow me.” Bowing and scraping, apologizing and babbling without pause, Furlan
led them up the stairs.
At the top, Perrin paused to look back. He heard the murmurs of “Lady” and “Ogier” down there,
could feel all those eyes, but it seemed to him that he felt one pair of eyes in particular, someone
staring not at Moiraine and Loial, but at him.
He picked her out immediately. For one thing, she stood apart from the others, and for another
she was the only woman in the room not wearing at least a little lace. Her dark gray, almost black,
dress was as plain as the ship captains’ clothes, with wide sleeves and narrow skirts, and never a
frill or stitch of fancy-work. The dress was divided for riding, he saw when she moved, and she wore
soft boots that peeked out under the hem. She was young—no older than he was, perhaps—and tall for
a woman, with black hair to her shoulders. A nose that just missed being too large and too bold, a
generous mouth, high cheekbones, and dark, slightly tilted eyes. He could not quite decide whether
she was beautiful or not.
As soon as he looked down, she turned to address one of the serving women and did not glance
at the stairs again, but he was sure he had been right. She had been staring at him.

CHAPTER

A Different Dance

Furlan burbled on as he showed them to their rooms, though Perrin did not really listen. He
was too busy wondering if the black-haired girl knew what yellow eyes meant. Burn me, she was
looking at me. Then he heard the innkeeper say the words “proclaiming the Dragon in Ghealdan,” and
he thought his ears would go to sharp points like Loial’s.
Moiraine stopped dead in the doorway to her room. “There is another false Dragon, innkeeper?
In Ghealdan?” The hood of her cloak still hid her face, but she sounded shaken to her toes. Even
listening for the man’s reply, Perrin could not help staring at her; he smelled something close to fear.
“Ah, Lady, never you fear. ’Tis a hundred leagues to Ghealdan, and none will trouble you here,
not with Master Andra about, and Lord Orban and Lord Gann. Why—”
“Answer her!” Lan said harshly. “Is there a false Dragon in Ghealdan?”
“Ah. Ah, no, Master Andra, not precisely. I said there’s a man proclaiming the Dragon in
Ghealdan, so we heard a few days gone. Preaching his coming, you might say. Talking about that
fellow over in Tarabon we’ve heard about. Though some do say ’tis Arad Doman, not Tarabon. A
long way from here, in any case. Why, any other day, I expect we’d talk more of that than anything
else, except maybe the wild tales about Hawkwing’s army come back—” Lan’s cold eyes might as
well have been knife blades from the way Furlan swallowed and scrubbed his hands faster. “I only
know what I hear, Master Andra. ’Tis said the fellow has a stare can pin you where you stand, and he
talks all sorts of rubbish about the Dragon coming to save us, and we all have to follow, and even the
beasts will fight for the Dragon. I don’t know whether they’ve arrested him yet or not. ’Tis likely; the
Ghealdanin would not put up long with that kind of talk.”
Masema, Perrin thought wonderingly. It’s bloody Masema.
“You are right, innkeeper,” Lan said. “This fellow isn’t likely to trouble us here. I knew a fellow
once who liked to make wild speeches. You remember him, Lady Alys, don’t you? Masema?”
Moiraine gave a start. “Masema. Yes. Of course. I had put him out of my mind.” Her voice
firmed. “When next I see Masema, he will wish someone had peeled his hide to make boots.” She
slammed the door behind her so hard that the crash echoed down the hallway.
“Keep a quiet!” came a muffled shout from the far end. “My head is splitting!”
“Ah.” Furlan washed his hands in one direction, then rubbed them in the other. “Ah. Forgive me,
Master Andra, but Lady Alys is a fierce-sounding woman.”
“Only with those who displease her,” Lan said blandly. “Her bite is far worse than her bark.”
“Ah. Ah. Ah. Your rooms are this way. Ah, friend Ogier, when Master Andra told me you were
coming, I had an old Ogier bed brought from the attic where it has been gathering dust these three
hundred years or more. Why, ’tis. . . .”
Perrin let the words wash over him, hearing them no more than a river rock hears the water. The

black-haired young woman worried him. And the caged Aiel.
Once in his own room—a small one in the back; Lan had done nothing to disabuse the innkeeper
of the notion that Perrin was a servant—he moved mechanically, still wrapped in thought. He unstrung
his bow and propped it in the corner—keeping it strung too long ruined bow and string alike—set
down his blanketroll and saddlebags beside the wash-stand and threw his cloak across them. He hung
his belts with quiver and axe from pegs on the wall, and nearly lay down on the bed before a jawcracking yawn reminded him how dangerous that might be. The bed was narrow, and the mattress
appeared to be all lumps; it looked more inviting than any bed he could remember. He sat on the
three-legged stool, instead, and thought. Always he liked to think things through.
After a time, Loial rapped on the door and put his head in. The Ogier’s ears practically quivered
with excitement, and his grin very nearly split his broad face in two. “Perrin, you will not believe it!
My bed is sung wood! Why, it must be well over a thousand years old. No Treesinger has sung a
piece so large in at least that long. I myself would not care to try it, and I have the talent more strongly
than most, now. Well, to be truthful, there are not many of us with the talent at all, anymore. But I am
among the best of those who can sing wood.”
“That is very interesting,” Perrin said. An Aiel in a cage. That is what Min said. Why was that
girl staring at me?
“I thought it was.” Loial sounded a little put out that he did not share the Ogier’s excitement, but
all Perrin wanted to do was think. “Supper is ready below, Perrin. They have prepared their finest in
case the Hunters want anything, but we can have some.”
“You go on, Loial. I’m not hungry.” The smells of cooking meat floating up from the kitchen did
not interest him. He hardly noticed Loial going.
Hands on his knees, yawning now and again, he tried to work it out. It seemed like one of those
puzzles Master Luhhan made, the metal pieces appearing to be linked inextricably. But there was
always a trick to make the iron loops and whirls come apart, and there had to be here, too.
The girl had been looking at him. His eyes might explain that, except that the innkeeper had
ignored them, and no one else had even noticed. They had an Ogier to look at, and Hunters of the
Horn in the house, and a Lady visiting, and an Aiel caged in the square. Nothing as small as the color
of a man’s eyes could seize their attention; nothing about a servant could compete with the rest. So
why did she pick me to stare at?
And the Aiel in the cage. What Min saw was always important. But how? What was he supposed
to do? I could have stopped those children throwing rocks. I should have. It was no use telling
himself the adults would certainly have told him to go on about his business, that he was a stranger in
Remen and the Aiel was none of his concern. I should have tried.
No answers came to him, so he went back to the beginning and patiently worked through it once
more, then again, and again. Still he found nothing except regret for what he had not done.
It came to him after a time that night had finally fallen. The room was dark except for a little
moonlight through the lone window. He thought about the tallow candle and the tinderbox he had seen
on the mantel over the narrow fireplace, but there was more than enough light for his eyes. I have to
do something, don’t I?
He buckled on his axe, then paused. He had done it without thinking; wearing the thing had
become as natural as breathing. He did not like that. But he left the belt around his waist, and went
out.
Light from the stairs made the hallway seem almost bright after his room. Talk and laughter
drifted up from the common room, and cooking smells from the kitchen. He strode toward the front of

the inn, to Moiraine’s room, knocked once, and went in. And stopped, his face burning.
Moiraine pulled the pale blue robe that hung from her shoulders around herself. “You wish
something?” she asked coolly. She had a silver-backed hairbrush in one hand, and her dark hair,
spilling down her neck in dark waves, glistened as if she had been brushing it. Her room was far finer
than his, with polished wooden paneling on the walls and silver-chased lamps and a warm fire on the
wide brick hearth. The air smelled of rose-scented soap.
“I. . . . I thought Lan was here,” he managed to get out. “You two always have your heads
together, and I thought he’d. . . . I thought. . . .”
“What do you want, Perrin?”
He took a deep breath. “Is this Rand’s doing? I know Lan followed him here, and it all seems
odd—the Hunters, and Aiel—but did he do it?”
“I do not think so. I will know more when Lan tells me what he discovers tonight. With luck,
what he finds will help with the choice I must make.”
“A choice?”
“Rand could have crossed the river and be on his way to Tear cross-country. Or he could have
taken ship downriver to Illian, meaning to board another there for Tear. The journey is leagues longer
that way, but days faster.”
“I don’t think we are going to catch him, Moiraine. I don’t know how he’s doing it, but even
afoot he is staying ahead of us. If Lan is right, he is still half a day ahead.”
“I could almost suspect he had learned to Travel,” Moiraine said with a small frown, “except
that if he had, he would have gone straight to Tear. No, he has the blood of long walkers and strong
runners in him. But we may take the river anyway. If I cannot catch him, I will be in Tear close behind
him. Or waiting for him.”
Perrin shifted his feet uneasily; there was cold promise in her voice. “You told me once that you
could sense a Darkfriend, one who was far gone into the Shadow, at least. Lan, too. Have you sensed
anything like that here?”
She gave a loud sniff and turned back to a tall standing mirror with finely made silver-work set
in the legs. Holding her robe closed with one hand, she ran the brush through her hair with the other.
“Very few humans are so far gone as that, Perrin, even among the worst Darkfriends.” The brush
halted in midstroke. “Why do you ask?”
“There was a girl down in the common room staring at me. Not at you and Loial, like everybody
else. At me.”
The brush resumed motion, and a smile briefly touched Moiraine’s lips. “You sometimes forget,
Perrin, that you are a good-looking young man. Some girls admire a pair of shoulders.” He grunted
and shuffled his feet. “Was there something else, Perrin?”
“Uh . . . no.” She could not help with Min’s viewing, not beyond telling him what he already
knew, that it was important. And he did not want to tell her what Min had seen. Or that Min had seen
anything, for that matter.
Back out in the hall with the door closed, he leaned against the wall for a moment. Light, just
walking in on her like that, and her. . . . She was a pretty woman. And likely old enough to be my
mother, or more. He thought Mat would probably have asked her down to the common room to
dance. No, he wouldn’t. Even Mat isn’t fool enough to try charming an Aes Sedai. Moiraine did
dance. He had danced with her once himself. And nearly fallen over his own feet with every other
step. Stop thinking about her like a village girl just because you saw. . . . She’s bloody Aes Sedai!
You have that Aiel to worry about. He gave himself a shake and went downstairs.

The common room was full as it could be, with every chair taken, and stools and benches
brought in, and those who had nowhere to sit standing along the walls. He did not see the blackhaired girl, and no one else looked at him twice as he hurriedly crossed the room.
Orban occupied a table to himself, his bandaged leg propped up on a chair with a cushion, with
a soft slipper on that foot, a silver goblet in his hand, the serving women keeping it filled with wine.
“Aye,” he was saying to the whole room, “we knew the Aiel for fierce fighters, Gann and I, but there
was no time to hesitate. I drew my sword, and dug my heels into Lion’s ribs. . . .”
Perrin gave a start before he realized the man meant his horse was named Lion. Wouldn’t put it
past him to say he was riding a lion. He felt a little ashamed; just because he did not like the man
was no reason to suppose the Hunter would take his boasting that far. He hurried on outside without
looking back.
The street in front of the inn was as crowded as inside, with people who could not find a place
in the common room peering in through the windows, and twice as many huddling around the doors to
listen to Orban’s tale. No one glanced at Perrin twice, though his passage brought muttered
complaints from those jostled a little further from the door.
Everyone who was out in the night must have been at the inn, for he saw no one as he walked to
the square. Sometimes the shadow of a person moved across a lighted window, but that was all. He
had the feel of being watched, though, and looked around uneasily. Nothing but night-cloaked streets
dotted with glowing windows. Around the square, most of the windows were dark except a few on
upper floors.
The gibbet stood as he remembered, the man—the Aiel—still in the cage, hanging higher than he
could reach. The Aiel seemed to be awake—at least his head was up—but he never looked down at
Perrin. The stones the children had been throwing were scattered beneath the cage.
The cage hung from a thick rope tied to a ring on one of the upper bars and running through a
heavy pulley on the crosspiece down to a pair of stubs, waist-high from the bottom of the upright on
either side. The excess rope lay in a careless tangle of coils at the foot of the gibbet.
Perrin looked around again, searching the dark square. He still had the feel of being watched, but
he still saw nothing. He listened, and heard nothing. He smelled chimney smoke and cooking from the
houses, and man-sweat and old blood from the man in the cage. There was no fear scent from him.
His weight, and then there’s the cage , he thought as he moved closer to the gibbet. He did not
know when he had decided to do this, or even if he really had decided, but he knew he was going to
do it.
Hooking a leg around the heavy upright, he heaved on the rope, hoisting the cage enough to gain a
little slack. The way the rope jerked told him the man in the cage had finally moved, but he was in too
much of a hurry to stop and tell him what he was doing. The slack let him unwind the rope from
around the stubs. Still bracing himself with his leg around the upright, he quickly lowered the cage
hand over hand to the paving blocks.
The Aiel was looking at him now, studying him silently. Perrin said nothing. When he got a good
look at the cage, his mouth tightened. If a thing was made, even a thing like this, it should be made
well. The entire front of the cage was a door, on rude hinges made by a hasty hand, held by a good
iron lock on a chain as badly wrought as the cage. He fumbled the chain around until he found the
worst link, then jammed the thick spike on his axe through it. A sharp twist of his wrist forced the link
open. In seconds he separated the chain, rattled it free, and swung open the front of the cage.
The Aiel sat there, knees yet under his chin, staring at him.
“Well?” Perrin whispered hoarsely. “I opened it, but I’m not going to bloody carry you.” He

looked hastily around the night-dark square. Still nothing moved, but he still had the feel of eyes
watching.
“You are strong, wetlander.” The Aiel did not move beyond working his shoulders. “It took
three men to hoist me up there. And now you bring me down. Why?”
“I don’t like seeing people in cages,” Perrin whispered. He wanted to go. The cage was open,
and those eyes were watching. But the Aiel was not moving. If you do a thing, do it right. “Will you
get out of there before somebody comes?”
The Aiel grasped the frontmost overhead bar of the cage, heaved himself out and to his feet in
one motion, then half hung there, supporting himself with his grip on the bar. He would have been
nearly a head taller than Perrin, standing straight. He glanced at Perrin’s eyes—Perrin knew how they
must shine, burnished gold in the moonlight—but he did not mention them. “I have been in there since
yesterday, wetlander.” He sounded like Lan. Not that their voices or accents were anything alike, but
the Aiel had that same unruffled coolness, that same calm sureness. “It will take a moment for my legs
to work. I am Gaul, of the Imran sept of the Shaarad Aiel, wetlander. I amShae’en M’taal, a Stone
Dog. My water is yours.”
“Well, I am Perrin Aybara. Of the Two Rivers. I’m a blacksmith.” The man was out of the cage;
he could go now. Only, if anyone came along before Gaul could walk, he would be right back into the
cage unless they killed him, and either way would waste Perrin’s work. “If I had thought, I’d have
brought a waterbottle, or a skin. Why do you call me ‘wetlander’?”
Gaul gestured toward the river; even Perrin’s eyes could not be sure in the moonlight, but he
thought the Aiel looked uneasy for the first time. “Three days ago, I watched a girl sporting in a huge
pool of water. It must have been twenty paces across. She . . . pulled herself out into it.” He made an
awkward swimming gesture with one hand. “A brave girl. Crossing these . . . rivers . . . has nearly
unmanned me. I never thought there could be such a thing as too much water, but I never thought there
was so much water in the world as you wetlanders have.”
Perrin shook his head. He knew the Aiel Waste held little water—it was one of the few things he
knew about the Waste or the Aiel—but he had not thought it could be scarce enough to cause this
reaction. “You’re a long way from home, Gaul. Why are you here?”
“We search,” Gaul said slowly. “We look for He Who Comes With the Dawn.”
Perrin had heard that name before, under circumstances that made him sure who it meant. Light,
it always comes back to Rand. I am tied to him like a mean horse for shoeing. “You are looking in
the wrong direction, Gaul. I’m looking for him, too, and he is on his way to Tear.”
“Tear?” The Aiel sounded surprised. “Why . . . ? But it must be. Prophecy says when the Stone
of Tear falls, we will leave the Three-fold Land at last.” That was the Aiel name for the Waste. “It
says we will be changed, and find again what was ours, and was lost.”
“That may be. I don’t know your prophecies, Gaul. Are you about ready to leave? Somebody
could come any minute.”
“It is too late to run,” Gaul said, and a deep voice shouted, “The savage is lose!” Ten or a dozen
white-cloaked men came running across the square, drawing swords, their conical helmets shining in
the moonlight. Children of the Light.
As if he had all the time in the world, Gaul calmly lifted a dark cloth from his shoulders and
wrapped it around his head, finishing with a thick black veil that hid his face except for his eyes. “Do
you like to dance, Perrin Aybara?” he asked. With that, he darted away from the cage. Straight at the
oncoming Whitecloaks.
For an instant they were caught by surprise, but an instant was apparently all the Aiel needed. He

kicked the sword out of the grip of the first to reach him, then his stiffened hand struck like a dagger at
the Whitecloak’s throat, and he slid around the soldier as he fell. The next man’s arm made a loud
snap as Gaul broke it. He pushed that man under the feet of a third, and kicked a fourth in the face. It
was like a dance, from one to the next without stopping or slowing, though the tripped fellow was
climbing back to his feet, and the one with the broken arm had shifted his sword. Gaul danced on in
the midst of them.
Perrin had only an amazed moment himself, for not all the Whitecloaks had put their attentions on
the Aiel. Barely in time, he gripped the axe haft with both hands to block a sword thrust, swung . . .
and wanted to cry out as the half-moon blade tore the man’s throat. But he had no time for crying out,
none for regrets; more Whitecloaks followed before the first fell. He hated the gaping wounds the axe
made, hated the way it chopped through mail to rend flesh beneath, split helmet and skull with almost
equal ease. He hated it all. But he did not want to die.
Time seemed to compress and stretch out, both at once. His body felt as if he fought for hours,
and breath rasped raw in his throat. Men seemed to move as though floating through jelly. They
seemed to leap in an instant from where they started to where they fell. Sweat rolled down his face,
yet he felt as cold as quenching water. He fought for his life, and he could not have said whether it
lasted seconds or all night.
When he finally stood, panting and nearly stunned, looking at a dozen white-cloaked men lying
on the paving blocks of the square, the moon appeared not to have moved at all. Some of the men
groaned; others lay silent and still. Gaul stood among them, still veiled, still empty-handed. Most of
the men down were his work. Perrin wished they all were, and felt ashamed. The smell of blood and
death was sharp and bitter.
“You do not dance the spears badly, Perrin Aybara.”
Head spinning, Perrin muttered, “I don’t see how twelve men fought twenty of you and won,
even if two of them are Hunters.”
“Is that what they say?” Gaul laughed softly. “Sarien and I were careless, being so long in these
soft lands, and the wind was from the wrong direction, so we smelled nothing. We walked into them
before we knew it. Well, Sarien is dead, and I was caged like a fool, so perhaps we paid enough. It is
time for running now, wetlander. Tear; I will remember it.” At last he lowered the black veil. “May
you always find water and shade, Perrin Aybara.” Turning, he ran into the night.
Perrin started to run, too, then realized he had a bloody axe in his hands. Hastily he wiped the
curved blade on a dead man’s cloak. He’s dead, burn me, and there’s blood on it already. He made
himself put the haft back through the loop on his belt before he broke into a trot.
At his second step he saw her, a slim shape at the edge of the square, in dark, narrow skirts. She
turned to run; he could see they were divided for riding. She darted back into the street and vanished.
Lan met him before he reached the place where she had been standing. The Warder took in the
cage sitting empty beneath the gibbet, the shadowed white mounds that caught the moonlight, and he
tossed his head as if he were about to erupt. In a voice as tight and hard as a new wheel rim, he said,
“Is this your work, blacksmith? The Light burn me! Is there anyone who can connect it to you?”
“A girl,” Perrin said. “I think she saw. I don’t want you to hurt her, Lan! Plenty of others could
have seen, too. There are lighted windows all around.”
The Warder grabbed Perrin’s coat sleeve and gave him a push toward the inn. “I saw a girl
running, but I thought. . . . No matter. You dig the Ogier out and haul him down to the stable. After
this, we need to get our horses to the docks as quickly as possible. The Light alone knows if there is a
ship sailing tonight, or what I’ll have to pay to hire one if there isn’t. Don’t ask questions, blacksmith!

Do it! Run!”

CHAPTER
35

The Falcon

The Warder’s long legs outdistanced Perrin’s, and by the time he pushed through the throng
outside the inn doors, Lan was already striding up the stairs, not seeming in any particular hurry.
Perrin made himself walk as slowly. From the doorway behind him came grumbles about people
pushing ahead of other people.
“Again?” Orban was saying, holding his silver cup up to be refilled. “Aye, very well. They lay
in ambush close beside the road we traveled, and an ambush I did not expect so close to Remen.
Screaming, they rushed upon us from the crowding brush. In a breath they were in our midst, their
spears stabbing, slaying two of my best men and one of Gann’s immediately. Aye, I knew Aiel when I
saw them, and. . . .”
Perrin hurried up the stairs. Well, Orban knows them now.
Voices came from behind Moiraine’s door. He did not want to hear what she had to say about
this. He hurried past to stick his head into Loial’s room.
The Ogier bed was a low, massive thing, twice as long and half as wide as any human bed
Perrin had ever seen. It took up much of the room, and that was as large and as fine as Moiraine’s.
Perrin vaguely remembered Loial saying something about it being sung wood, and at any other time he
might have stopped to admire those flowing curves that made it seem as if the bed had somehow
grown where it stood. Ogier really must have stopped in Remen at some time in the past, for the
innkeeper had also found a wooden armchair that fit Loial, and filled it with cushions. The Ogier was
comfortably sitting on them in his shirt and breeches, idly scratching a bare ankle with a toenail as he
wrote in a large, cloth-bound book on an arm of the chair.
“We’re leaving!” Perrin said.
Loial gave a jump, nearly upsetting his ink bottle and almost dropping the book. “Leaving? We
only just arrived,” he rumbled.
“Yes, leaving. Meet us at the stable as quickly as you can. And don’t let anyone see you go. I
think there’s a back stair that runs down by the kitchen.” The smell of food at his end of the hall had
been too strong for there not to be.
The Ogier gave one regretful look at the bed, then started tugging on his high boots. “But why?”
“The Whitecloaks,” Perrin said. “I’ll tell you more later.” He ducked back out before Loial
could ask any more.
He had not unpacked. Once he had belted on his quiver, slung his cloak around him, tossed
blanketroll and saddlebags on his shoulder, and picked up his bow, there was no sign he had ever
been there. Not a wrinkle in the folded blankets at the foot of the bed, not a splash of water in the
cracked basin on the washstand. Even the tallow candle still had a fresh wick, he realized. I must
have known I would not be staying. I don’t seem to leave any mark behind me, of late.

As he has suspected, a narrow stair at the back led down to a hall that ran out past the kitchen.
He peered cautiously into the kitchen. A spit dog trotted in his big wicker wheel, turning a long spit
that held a haunch of lamb, a large piece of beef, five chickens, and a goose. Fragrant steam rose from
a soup cauldron hanging from a sturdy crane over a second hearth. But there was not a cook to be
seen, nor any living soul except the dog. Thankful for Orban’s lies, he hurried on into the night.
The stable was a large structure of the same stone as the inn, though only the stone faces around
the big doors had been polished. A single lantern hanging from a stallpost gave a dim light. Stepper
and the other horses stood in stalls near the doors; Loial’s big mount nearly filled his. The smell of
hay and horses was familiar and comforting. Perrin was the first to arrive.
There was only one stableman on duty, a narrow-faced fellow in a dirty shirt, with lanky gray
hair, who demanded to know who Perrin was to order four horses saddled, and who was his master,
and what he was doing all bundled up to travel in the middle of the night, and did Master Furlan know
he was sneaking off like this, and what did he have hidden in those saddlebags, and what was wrong
with his eyes, was he sick?
A coin flipped through the air from behind Perrin, glinting gold in the lantern light. The
stableman snagged it with one hand and bit it.
“Saddle them,” Lan said. His voice was soft, as cold iron is soft, and the stableman bobbed a
bow and scurried to make the horses ready.
Moiraine and Loial came into the stable just as they could take up their reins, and then they were
all leading their horses behind Lan, off down a street that ran behind the stable toward the river. The
soft clop of the horses’ hooves on the paving blocks attracted only a slat-ribbed dog that barked once
and ran away as they went by.
“This brings back memories, doesn’t it, Perrin?” Loial said, quietly for him.
“Keep your voice down,” Perrin whispered. “What memories?”
“Why, it is like old times.” The Ogier had managed to mute his voice; he sounded like a
bumblebee only the size of a dog instead of a horse. “Sneaking away in the night, with enemies behind
us, and maybe enemies ahead, and danger in the air, and the cold tang of adventure.”
Perrin frowned at Loial over Stepper’s saddle. It was easy enough; his eyes cleared the saddle,
and Loial stood head and shoulders and chest above it on the other side. “What are you talking about?
I believe you are coming to like danger! Loial, you must be crazy!”
“I am only fixing the mood in my head,” Loial said, sounding formal. Or perhaps defensive. “For
my book. I have to put it all in. I believe I am coming to like it. Adventuring. Of course, I am.” His
ears gave two violent twitches. “I have to like it if I wish to write of it.”
Perrin shook his head.
At the stone wharves the barge like ferries lay snugged for the night, still and dark, as did most
of the ships. Lantern lights and people moved around on the dock alongside a two-masted vessel,
though, and on the deck as well. The main smells were tar and rope, with strong hints of fish, though
something back in the nearest warehouse gave off sharp, spicy aromas that the others nearly
submerged.
Lan located the captain, a short, slight man with an odd way of holding his head tilted to one side
while he listened. The bargaining was over soon enough, and booms and sling rigged to hoist the
horses aboard. Perrin kept a close eye on the horses, talking to them; horses had little tolerance for
the unusual, such as being lifted into the air, but even the Warder’s stallion seemed soothed by his
murmurs.
Lan gave gold to the captain, and silver to two sailors who ran barefoot to a warehouse for

sacks of oats. More crewmen tethered the horses between the masts in a sort of small pen made of
rope, all the while muttering about the mess they would have to clean. Perrin did not think anyone was
supposed to overhear, but his ears caught the words. The men were just not used to horses.
In short order the Snow Goose was ready to sail, only a little ahead of what the captain—his
name was Jaim Adarra—had intended. Lan led Moiraine below as the lines were cast off, and Loial
followed yawning. Perrin stayed at the railing near the bow, though the Ogier’s every yawn had
summoned one of his own. He wondered if the Snow Goose could outrun wolves down the river,
outrun dreams. Men began readying the sweeps to push the vessel away from the wharf.
As the last line was tossed ashore and seized by a dockman, a girl in narrow, divided skirts
burst out of the shadows between two warehouses, a bundle in her arms and a dark cloak streaming
behind her. She leaped onto the deck just as the men at the sweeps began pushing off.
Adarra bustled from his place by the tiller, but she calmly set down her bundle and said briskly,
“I will take passage downriver . . . oh . . . say, as far as he is going.” She nodded toward Perrin
without looking at him. “I’ve no objections to sleeping on deck. Cold and wet do not bother me.”
A few minutes of bargaining followed. She passed over three silver marks, frowned at the
coppers she got back, then stuffed them into her purse and came forward to stand beside Perrin.
She had an herbal scent to her, light and fresh and clean. Those dark, tilted eyes regarded him
over high cheekbones, then turned to look back toward shore. She was about his own age, he decided;
he could not decide if her nose fit her face, or dominated it. You are a fool, Perrin Aybara. Why care
what she looks like?
The gap to the wharf was a good twenty paces, now; the sweeps dug in, cutting white furrows in
black water. For a moment he considered tossing her over the side.
“Well,” she said after a moment, “I never expected my travels to take me back to Illian so soon
as this.” Her voice was high, and she had a flat way of speaking, but it was not unpleasant. “You are
going to Illian, are you not?” He tightened his mouth. “Don’t sulk,” she said. “You left quite a mess
back there, you and that Aielman between you. The uproar was just beginning when I left.”
“You did not tell them?” he said in surprise.
“The townsfolk think the Aielman chewed through the chain, or broke it with his bare hands.
They had not decided which when I left.” She made a sound suspiciously like a giggle. “Orban was
quite loud in his disgust that his wounds would keep him from hunting down the Aielman personally.”
Perrin snorted. “If he ever sees an Aiel again, he’ll bloody soil himself.” He cleared his throat
and muttered, “Sorry.”
“I do not know about that,” she said, as if his remark had been nothing out of the way. “I saw him
in Jehannah during the winter. He fought four men together, killed two and made the other two yield.
Of course, he started the fight, so that takes something away from it, but they knew what they were
doing. He did not pick a fight with men who could not defend themselves. Still, he is a fool. He has
these peculiar ideas about the Great Blackwood. What some call the Forest of Shadows. Have you
ever heard of it?”
He eyed her sideways. She spoke of fighting and killing as calmly as another woman might speak
of baking. He had never heard of any Great Blackwood, but the Forest of Shadows lay just south of
the Two Rivers. “Are you following me? You were staring at me, back at the inn. Why? And why
didn’t you tell them what you saw?”
“An Ogier,” she said, staring at the river, “is obviously an Ogier, and the others were not much
more difficult to figure out. I managed a much better look inside Lady Alys’s hood than Orban did,
and her face makes that stone-faced fellow a Warder. The Light burn me if I’d want that one angry

with me. Does he always look like that, or did he eat a rock for his last meal? Anyway, that left only
you. I do not like things I cannot account for.”
Once again he considered tossing her over the side. Seriously, this time. But Remen was now
only a blotch of light well behind them in the darkness, and no telling how far it was to shore.
She seemed to take his silence as an urging to go on. “So there I have an”—she looked around,
then dropped her voice, though the closest crewman was working a sweep ten feet away—“an Aes
Sedai, a Warder, an Ogier—and you. A countryman, by first look at you.” Her tilted eyes rose to
study his yellow ones intently—he refused to look away—and she smiled. “Only you free a caged
Aielman, hold a long talk with him, then help him chop a dozen Whitecloaks into sausage. I assume
you do this regularly; you certainly looked as if it were nothing out of the ordinary for you. I scent
something strange in a party of travelers such as yours, and strange trails are what Hunters look for.”
He blinked; there was no mistaking that emphasis. “A Hunter? You? You cannot be a Hunter.
You’re a girl.”
Her smile became so innocent that he almost walked away from her. She stepped back, made a
flourish with each hand, and was holding two knives as neatly as old Thom Merrilin could have done
it. One of the men at the sweeps made a choking sound, and two others stumbled; sweeps thrashed and
tangled, and the Snow Goose lurched a little before the captain’s shouts set things right. By that time,
the black-haired girl had made the knives disappear again.
“Nimble fingers and nimble wits will take you a good deal further than a sword and muscles.
Sharp eyes help, as well, but fortunately, I have these things.”
“And modesty, as well,” Perrin murmured. She did not seem to notice.
“I took the oath and received the blessing in the Great Square of Tammaz, in Illian. Perhaps I
was the youngest, but in that crowd, with all the trumpets and drums and cymbals and shouting. . . . A
six-year-old could have taken the oath, and none would have noticed. There were over a thousand of
us, perhaps two, and every one with an idea of where to find the Horn of Valere. I have mine—it still
may be the right one—but no Hunter can afford to pass up a strange trail. The Horn will certainly lie
at the end of a strange trail, and I have never seen one any stranger than the trail you four make. Where
are you bound? Illian? Somewhere else?”
“What was your idea?” he asked. “About where the Horn is?” Safe in Tar Valon, I hope, and
the Light send I never see it again. “You think it’s in Ghealdan?”
She frowned at him—he had the feeling she did not give up a scent once she had raised it, but he
was ready to offer her as many side trails as she would take—then said, “Have you ever heard of
Manetheren?”
He nearly choked. “I have heard of it,” he said cautiously.
“Every queen of Manetheren was an Aes Sedai, and the king the Warder bound to her. I can’t
imagine a place like that, but that is what the books say. It was a large land—most of Andor and
Ghealdan and more besides—but the capital, the city itself, was in the Mountains of Mist. That is
where I think the Horn is. Unless you four lead me to it.”
His hackles stirred. She was lecturing him as if he were an untaught village lout. “You’ll not find
the Horn or Manetheren. The city was destroyed during the Trolloc Wars, when the last queen drew
too much of the One Power to destroy the Dreadlords who had killed her husband.” Moiraine had told
him the names of that king and queen, but he did not remember them.
“Not in Manetheren, farmboy,” she said calmly, “though a land such as that would make a good
hiding place. But there were other nations, other cities, in the Mountains of Mist, so old that not even
Aes Sedai remember them. And think of all those stories about it being bad luck to enter the

mountains. What better place for the Horn to be hidden than in one of those forgotten cities.”
“I have heard stories of something being hidden in the mountains.” Would she believe him? He
had never been good at lying. “The stories did not say what, but it’s supposed to be the greatest
treasure in the world, so maybe it is the Horn. But the Mountains of Mist stretch for hundreds of
leagues. If you are going to find it, you should not waste time following us. You’ll need it all to find
the Horn before Orban and Gann.”
“I told you, those two have some strange idea the Horn is hidden in the Great Blackwood.” She
smiled up at him. Her mouth was not too big at all, when she smiled. “And I told you a Hunter has to
follow strange trails. You are lucky Orban and Gann were injured fighting all those Aielmen, or they
might well be aboard, too. At least I will not get in your way, or try to take over, or pick a fight with
the Warder.”
He growled disgustedly. “We are just travelers on our way to Illian, girl. What is your name? If I
have to share this ship with you for days yet, I can’t keep calling you girl.”
“I call myself Mandarb.” He could not stop the guffaw that burst out of him. Those tilted eyes
regarded him with heat. “I will teach you something, farmboy.” Her voice remained level. Barely. “In
the Old Tongue, Mandarb means ‘blade.’ It is a name worthy of a Hunter of the Horn!”
He managed to get his laughter under control, and hardly wheezed at all as he pointed to the rope
pen between the masts. “You see that black stallion? His name is Mandarb.”
The heat went out of her eyes, and spots of color bloomed on her cheeks. “Oh. I was born Zarine
Bashere, but Zarine is no name for a Hunter. In the stories, Hunters have names like Rogosh Eagleeye.”
She looked so crestfallen that he hastened to say, “I like the name Zarine. It suits you.” The heat
flashed back into her eyes, and for a moment he thought she was about to produce one of her knives
again. “It is late, Zarine. I want some sleep.”
He turned his back to start for the hatch that led belowdeck, prickles running across his
shoulders. Crewmen still padded up the deck and back, working the sweeps. Fool. A girl would not
stick a knife in me. Not with all these people watching. Would she? Just as he reached the hatch, she
called to him.
“Farmboy! Perhaps I will call myself Faile. My father used to call me that, when I was little. It
means ‘falcon.’ ”
He stiffened and almost missed the first step of the ladder. Coincidence. He made himself go
down without looking back toward her. It has to be. The passageway was dark, but enough moonlight
filtered down behind him for him to make his way. Someone was snoring loudly in one of the cabins.
Min, why did you have to go seeing things?

CHAPTER
36

Daughter of the Night

Realizing that he had no way of knowing which cabin was supposed to be his, he put his head
into several. They were dark, and all of them had two men asleep in the narrow beds built against
each side, all but one, which held Loial, sitting on the floor between the beds—and barely fitting—
scribbling in his cloth-bound book of notes by the light of a gimballed lantern. The Ogier wanted to
talk about the events of the day, but Perrin, jaws creaking with the effort of holding his yawns in,
thought the ship must have run far enough downriver by now to make it safe to sleep. Safe to dream.
Even if they tried, wolves could not long keep pace with the sweeps and the current.
Finally he found a windowless cabin with no one in it at all, which suited him just as well. He
wanted to be alone. A coincidence in the name, that’s all , he thought as he lit the lantern mounted on
the wall. Anyway, her real name is Zarine. But the girl with the high cheekbones and dark, tilted eyes
was not uppermost in his thoughts. He put his bow and other belongings on one cramped bed, tossed
his cloak over them, and sat on the other to tug off his boots.
Elyas Machera had found a way to live with what he was, a man somehow linked with wolves,
and he had not gone mad. Thinking back, Perrin was sure Elyas had been living that way for years
before he ever met the man. He wants to be that way. He accepts it, anyway. That was no solution.
Perrin did not want to live that way, did not want to accept. But if you have the bar stock to make a
knife, you accept it and make a knife, even if you’d like a woodaxe. No! My life is more than iron
to be hammered into shape.
Cautiously, he reached out with his mind, feeling for wolves, and found—nothing. Oh, there was
a dim impression of wolves somewhere in the distance, but it faded even as he touched it. For the
first time in so long, he was alone. Blessedly alone.
Blowing out the lantern, he lay down, for the first time in days. How in the Light will Loial
manage in one of these? Those all but sleepless nights rolled over him, exhaustion slacking his
muscles. It came to him that he had managed to put the Aiel out of his head. And the Whitecloaks.
Light-forsaken axe! Burn me, I wish I had never seen it, was his last thought before sleep.
Thick gray fog surrounded him, dense enough low down that he could not see his own boots, and
so heavy on every side that he could not make out anything ten paces away. There was surely nothing
nearer. Anything at all might lie within it. The mist did not feel right; there was no dampness to it. He
put a hand to his belt, seeking the comfort of knowing he could defend himself, and gave a start. His
axe was not there.
Something moved in the fog, a swirling in the grayness. Something coming his way.
He tensed, wondering if it was better to run or stand and fight with his bare hands, wondering if
there was anything to fight.

The billowing furrow boring through the fog resolved itself into a wolf, its shaggy form almost
one with the heavy mist.
Hopper?
The wolf hesitated, then came to stand beside him. It was Hopper—he was certain—but
something about the wolf’s stance, something in the yellow eyes that looked up briefly to meet his,
demanded silence, in mind as well as body. Those eyes demanded that he follow, too.
He laid a hand on the wolf’s back, and as he did, Hopper started forward. He let himself be led.
The fur under his hand was thick and shaggy. It felt real.
The fog began to thicken, until only his hand told him Hopper was still there, until a glance down
did not even show him his own chest. Just gray mist. He might as well have been wrapped in newsheared wool for all he could see. It struck him that he had heard nothing, either. Not even the sound
of his own footsteps. He wiggled his toes, and was relieved to feel the boots on his feet.
The gray became darker, and he and the wolf walked through pitch-blackness. He could not see
his hand when he touched his nose. He could not see his nose, for that matter. He tried closing his
eyes for a moment, and could not tell any difference. There was still no sound. His hand felt the rough
hair of Hopper’s back, but he was not sure he could feel anything under his boots.
Suddenly Hopper stopped, forcing him to halt, too. He looked around . . . and snapped his eyes
shut. He could tell a difference, now. And feel something, too, a queasy twisting of his stomach. He
made himself open his eyes and look down.
What he saw could not have been there, not unless he and Hopper were standing in midair. He
could see nothing of the wolf or himself, as if neither had bodies at all—that thought nearly tied his
stomach into knots—but below him, as clear as if lit by a thousand lamps, stretched a vast array of
mirrors, seemingly hanging in blackness though as level as if they stood on a vast floor. They
stretched as far as he could see in every direction, but right beneath his feet, there was a clear space.
And people in it. Suddenly he could hear their voices as well as if he had been standing among them.
“Great Lord,” one of the men muttered, “where is this place?” He looked around once, flinching
at his image cast back at him many thousandfold, and held his eyes forward after that. The others
huddled around him seemed even more afraid. “I was asleep in Tar Valon, Great Lord. I am asleep in
Tar Valon! Where is this place? Have I gone mad?”
Some of the men around him wore ornate coats full of embroidery, others plainer garb, while
some seemed to be naked, or in their smallclothes.
“I, too, sleep,” a naked man nearly screamed. “In Tear. I remember lying down with my wife!”
“And I do sleep in Illian,” a man in red and gold said, sounding shaken. “I know that I do sleep,
but that cannot be. I know that I do dream, but that does be impossible. Where does this be, Great
Lord? Are you really come to me?”
The dark-haired man who faced them was garbed in black, with silver lace at his throat and
wrists. Now and again he put a hand to his chest, as if it hurt him. There was light everywhere down
there, coming from nowhere, but this man below Perrin seemed cloaked in shadow. Darkness rolled
around him, caressed him.
“Silence!” The black-clothed man did not speak loudly, but he had no need to. For the space of
that word, he had raised his head; his eyes and mouth were holes boring into a raging forge-fire, all
flame and fiery glow.
Perrin knew him, then. Ba’alzamon. He was staring down at Ba’alzamon himself. Fear struck
through him like hammered spikes. He would have run, but he could not feel his feet.
Hopper shifted. He felt the thick fur under his hand and gripped it hard. Something real.

Something more real, he hoped, than what he saw. But he knew that both were real.
The men huddling together cowered.
“You have been given tasks,” Ba’alzamon said. “Some of these tasks you have carried out. At
others, you have failed.” Now and again his eyes and mouth vanished in flame again, and the mirrors
flashed with reflected fire. “Those who have been marked for death must die. Those who have been
marked for taking must bow to me. To fail the Great Lord of the Dark cannot be forgiven.” Fire shone
through his eyes, and the darkness around him roiled and spun. “You.” His finger pointed out the man
who had spoken of Tar Valon, a fellow dressed like a merchant, in plainly cut clothes of the finest
cloth. The others shied away from him as if he had blackbile fever, leaving him to cower alone. “You
allowed the boy to escape Tar Valon.”
The man screamed, and began to quiver like a file struck against an anvil. He seemed to become
less solid, and his scream thinned with him.
“You all dream,” Ba’alzamon said, “but what happens in this dream is real.” The shrieking man
was only a bundle of mist shaped like a man, his scream far distant, and then even the mist was gone.
“I fear he will never wake.” He laughed, and his mouth roared flame. “The rest of you will not fail
me again. Begone! Wake, and obey!” The other men vanished.
For a moment Ba’alzamon stood alone, then suddenly there was a woman with him, clad all in
white and silver.
Shock hit Perrin. He could never forget a woman so beautiful. She was the woman from his
dream, the one who had urged him to glory.
An ornate silver throne appeared behind her, and she sat, carefully arranging her silken skirts.
“You make free use of my domain,” she said.
“Your domain?” Ba’alzamon said. “You claim it yours, then? Do you no longer serve the Great
Lord of the Dark?” The darkness around him thickened for an instant, seemed to boil.
“I serve,” she said quickly. “I have served the Lord of the Twilight long. Long did I lie
imprisoned for my service, in an endless, dreamless sleep. Only Gray Men and Myrddraal are denied
dreams. Even Trollocs can dream. Dreams were always mine, to use and walk. Now I am free again,
and I will use what is mine.”
“What is yours,” Ba’alzamon said. The blackness swirling ’round him seemed mirthful. “You
always thought yourself greater than you were, Lanfear.”
The name cut at Perrin like a newly honed knife. One of the Forsaken had been in his dreams.
Moiraine had been right. Some of them were free.
The woman in white was on her feet, the throne gone. “I am as great as I am. What have your
plans come to? Three thousand years and more of whispering in ears and pulling the strings of throned
puppets like an Aes Sedai!” Her voice invested the name with all scorn. “Three thousand years, and
yet Lews Therin walks the world again, and these Aes Sedai all but have him leashed. Can you
control him? Can you turn him? He was mine before ever that straw-haired chit Ilyena saw him! He
will be mine again!”
“Do you serve yourself now, Lanfear?” Ba’alzamon’s voice was soft, but flame raged
continuously in his eyes and mouth. “Have you abandoned your oaths to the Great Lord of the Dark?”
For an instant the darkness nearly obliterated him, only the glowing fires showing through. “They are
not so easily broken as the oaths to the Light you forsook, proclaiming your new master in the very
Hall of the Servants. Your master claims you forever, Lanfear. Will you serve, or do you choose an
eternity of pain, of endless dying without release?”
“I serve.” Despite her words, she stood tall and defiant. “I serve the Great Lord of the Dark and

none other. Forever!”
The vast array of mirror began to vanish as if black waves rolled in over it, ever closer to the
center. The tide rolled over Ba’alzamon and Lanfear. There was only blackness.
Perrin felt Hopper move, and he was more than glad to follow, guided only by the feel of fur
under his hand. It was not until he was moving that he realized he could. He tried to puzzle out what
he had seen, without any success. Ba’alzamon and Lanfear. His tongue stuck to the roof of his mouth.
For some reason, Lanfear frightened him more than Ba’alzamon did. Perhaps because she had been in
his dreams in the mountains. Light! One of the Forsaken in my dreams! Light! And unless he had
missed something, she had defied the Dark One. He had been told and taught that the Shadow could
have no power over you if you denied it; but how could a Darkfriend—not just a Darkfriend; one of
the Forsaken!—defy the Shadow? I must be mad, like Simion’s brother. These dreams have driven
me mad!
Slowly the blackness became fog again, and the fog gradually thinned until he walked out of it
with Hopper onto a grassy hillside bright with daylight. Birds began to sing from a thicket at the foot
of the hill. He looked back. A hilly plain dotted with clumps of trees stretched to the horizon. There
was no sign of fog anywhere. The big, grizzled wolf stood watching him.
“What was that?” he demanded, struggling in his mind to turn the question to thoughts the wolf
could understand. “Why did you show it to me? What was it?”
Emotions and images flooded his thoughts, and his mind put words to them. What you must see.
Be careful, Young Bull. This place is dangerous. Be wary as a cub hunting porcupine. That came as
something closer to Small Thorny Back, but his mind named the animal the way he knew it as a man.
You are too young, too new.
“Was it real?”
All is real, what is seen, and what is not seen. That seemed to be all the answer Hopper was
going to give.
“Hopper, how are you here? I saw you die. I felt you die!”
All are here. All brothers and sisters that are, all that were, all that will be. Perrin knew that
wolves did not smile, not the way humans did, but for an instant he had the impression that Hopper
was grinning. Here, I soar like the eagle. The wolf gathered himself and leaped, up into the air. Up
and up it carried him, until he dwindled to a speck in the sky, and a last thought came. To soar.
Perrin stared after him with his mouth hanging open. He did it. His eyes burned suddenly, and he
cleared his throat and scrubbed at his nose. I will be crying like a girl, next. Without thinking, he
looked around to see if anyone had seen him, and that quickly everything changed.
He was standing on a rise, with shadowy, indistinct dips and swells all around him. They
seemed to fade into the distance too soon. Rand stood below him. Rand, and a ragged circle of
Myrddraal and men and women his eyes seemed to slide right past. Dogs howled somewhere in the
distance, and Perrin knew they were hunting something. Myrddraal scent and the stink of burned
sulphur filled the air. Perrin’s hackles rose.
The circle of Myrddraal and people came closer to Rand, all walking as if asleep. And Rand
began to kill them. Balls of fire flew from his hands and consumed two. Lightning flashed from above
to shrivel others. Bars of light like white-hot steel flew from his fists to more. And the survivors
continued to walk slowly closer, as if none of them saw what was happening. One by one they died,
until none were left, and Rand sank down on his knees, panting. Perrin was not sure whether he was
laughing or crying; it seemed to be some of each.
Shapes appeared over the rises, more people coming, more Myrddraal, all intent on Rand.

Perrin cupped his hands to his mouth. “Rand! Rand, there are more coming!”
Rand looked up at him from his crouch, snarling, sweat slicking his face.
“Rand, they’re—!”
“Burn you!” Rand howled.
Light burned Perrin’s eyes, and pain seared everything.
Groaning, he rolled into a ball on the narrow bed, the light still burning behind his eyelids. His
chest hurt. He raised a hand to it and winced when he felt a burn under his shirt, a spot no bigger than
a silver penny.
Bit by bit he forced his knotted muscles to let him straighten his legs and lie flat in the dark
cabin. Moiraine. I have to tell Moiraine this time. Just have to wait till the pain goes away.
But as the pain began to fade, exhaustion took him. He barely had a thought that he must get up
before sleep pulled him down again.
When he opened his eyes again, he lay staring at the beams overhead. Light at the top and bottom
of the door told him morning had come. He put a hand to his chest to convince himself he had
imagined it, imagined it so well that he had actually felt a burn. . . .
His fingers found the burn. I didn’t imagine it, then. He had dim memories of a few other
dreams, fading even as he recalled them. Ordinary dreams. He even felt as if he had had a good
night’s sleep. And could use another one right now. But it meant he could sleep. As long as there are
no wolves around, anyway.
He remembered making a decision in that brief waking after the dream with Hopper, and after a
moment he decided it had been a good one.
It took knocking on five doors and being cursed at twice—the inhabitants of two cabins had gone
on deck—before he found Moiraine. She was fully dressed, but sitting on one of the narrow beds
cross-legged, reading in her book of notes by lantern light. Back near the beginning, he saw, notes that
must have been made even before she had come to Emond’s Field. Lan’s things were neatly placed on
the other bed.
“I had a dream,” he told her, and proceeded to tell her of it. All of it. He even pulled up his shirt
to show her the small circle on his chest, red, with wavy red lines radiating from it. He had kept
things from her before, and he suspected he would again, but this might be too important to hold back.
The pin was the smallest part of a pair of scissors, and the easiest made, but without it, the scissors
cut no cloth. When he was done, he stood there waiting.
She had watched him without expression, except that those dark eyes had examined every word
as it came out of his mouth, weighed it, measured it, held it up to the light. Now she sat the same way,
only it was he who was examined, weighed, and held up to the light.
“Well, is it important?” he demanded finally. “I think it was one of those wolf dreams you told
me about—I’m sure it was; it must have been!—but that doesn’t make what I saw real. Only, you said
maybe some of the Forsaken are free, and he called her Lanfear, and. . . . Is it important, or am I
standing here making a fool out of myself?”
“There are women,” she said slowly, “who would do their best to gentle you if they heard what I
just did.” His lungs seemed to freeze; he could not breathe. “I am not accusing you of being able to
channel,” she went on, and the ice inside him melted, “or even of being able to learn. An attempt at
gentling would not harm you, beyond the rough treatment the Red Ajah would give you before they
realized their error. Such men are so rare, even the Reds with all their hunting have not found more
than three in the last ten years. Before the outbreak of false Dragons, at least. What I am trying to

make clear to you is that I do not think you will suddenly begin wielding the Power. You do not have
to be afraid of that.”
“Well, thank you very much for that,” he said bitterly. “You did not have to scare me to death
just so you could tell me there was no need to be frightened!”
“Oh, you do have reason to be frightened. Or at least careful, as the wolf suggested. Red sisters,
or others, might kill you before they discovered there was nothing to gentle in you.”
“Light! Light burn me!” He stared at her with a frown. “You’re trying to lead me around by the
nose, Moiraine, but I am no calf, and there’s no ring in my nose. The Red Ajah or any other would not
think of gentling unless there was something real in what I dreamed. Does it mean the Forsaken are
loose?”
“I told you before that they might be. Some of them. Your . . . dreams are nothing I expected,
Perrin. Dreamers have written of wolves, but I did not expect this.”
“Well, I think it was real. I think I saw something that really happened, something I wasn’t
supposed to see.” What you must see. “I think Lanfear is loose at the very least. What are you going
to do?”
“I am going to Illian. And then I will go to Tear, and hope to reach it before Rand. We had need
to leave Remen too quickly for Lan to learn whether he crossed the river or went down it. We should
know before we reach Illian, though. We will find sign if he has gone this way.” She glanced at her
book as if she wanted to resume her reading.
“Is that all you are going to do? With Lanfear loose, and the Light alone knows how many of the
others?”
“Do not question me,” she said coldly. “You do not know which questions to ask, and you would
comprehend less than half the answers if I gave them. Which I will not.”
He shifted his feet under her gaze until it became clear she would say no more on the matter. His
shirt rubbed painfully at the burn on his chest. It did not seem a bad hurt—Not for being struck by
lightning it doesn’t!—but how he had come by it was another matter. “Uh. . . . Will you Heal this?”
“Are you no longer uneasy about the One Power being used on you, then, Perrin? No, I will not
Heal it. It is not serious, and it will remind you of the need to be careful.” Careful about pressing her,
he knew, as well as about dreams or letting others know of them. “If there is nothing else, Perrin?”
He started for the door, then stopped. “There is one thing. If you knew a woman’s name was
Zarine, would you think it meant anything about her?”
“Why under the Light do you ask this question?”
“A girl,” he said awkwardly. “A young woman. I met her last night. She’s one of the other
passengers.” He would let her discover for herself that Zarine knew she was Aes Sedai. And seemed
to think following them would lead her to the Horn of Valere. He would not keep back anything he
thought was important, but if Moiraine could be secretive, so could he.
“Zarine. It is a Saldaean name. No woman would name her daughter that unless she expected her
to be a great beauty. And a heartbreaker. One to lie on cushions in palaces, surrounded by servants
and suitors.” She smiled, briefly but with great amusement. “Perhaps you have another reason to be
careful, Perrin, if there is a Zarine as a passenger with us.”
“I intend to be careful,” he told her. At least he knew why Zarine did not like her name. Hardly
fitting for a Hunter of the Horn. As long as she doesn’t call herself “falcon.”
When he went on deck, Lan was there, looking over Mandarb. And Zarine was sitting on a coil
of rope near the railing, sharpening one of her knives and watching him. The big, triangular sails were
set and taut, and the Snow Goose flew downriver.

Zarine’s eyes followed Perrin as he walked by her to stand in the bow. The water curled to
either side of the prow like earth turning around a good plow. He wondered about dreams and
Aielmen, Min’s viewings and falcons. His chest hurt. Life had never been as tangled as this.
Rand sat up out of his exhausted sleep, gasping, the cloak he had used as a blanket falling away.
His side ached, the old wound from Falme throbbing. His fire had burned down to coals with only a
few wavering flames, but it was still enough to make the shadows move. That was Perrin. It was! It
was him, not a dream. Somehow. I almost killed him! Light, I have to be careful!
Shivering, he picked up a length of oak branch and started to shove it into the coals. The trees
were scattered in these Murandian hills, still close to the Manetherendrelle, but he had found just
enough fallen branches for his fire, the wood just old enough to be properly cured but not rotten.
Before the wood touched the coals, he stopped. There were horses coming, ten or a dozen of them,
walking slowly. I have to be careful. I cannot make another mistake.
The horses swung toward his failing fire, entered the dim light, and stopped. The shadows
obscured their riders, but most seemed to be rough-faced men wearing round helmets and long leather
jerkins sewn all over with metal discs like fish scales. One was a woman with graying hair and a nononsense look on her face. Her dark dress was plain wool, but the finest weave, and adorned with a
silver pin in the shape of a lion. A merchant, she seemed to him; he had seen her sort among those
who came to buy tabac and wool in the Two Rivers. A merchant and her guards.
I have to be careful, he thought as he stood. No mistakes.
“You have chosen a good campsite, young man,” she said. “I have often used it on my way to
Remen. There is a small spring nearby. I trust you have no objection to my sharing it?” Her guards
were already dismounting, hitching at their sword belts and loosening saddle girths.
“None,” Rand told her. Careful. Two steps brought him close enough, and he leaped into the air,
spinning—Thistledown Floats on the Whirlwind—heron-mark blade carved from fire coming into his
hands to take her head off before surprise could even form on her face. She was the most dangerous.
He alighted as the woman’s head rolled from the crupper of her horse. The guards yelled and
clawed for their swords, screamed as they realized his blade burned. He danced among them in the
forms Lan had taught him, and knew he could have killed all ten with ordinary steel, but the blade he
wielded was part of him. The last man fell, and it had been so like practicing the forms that he had
already begun the sheathing called Folding the Fan before he remembered he wore no scabbard and
this blade would have turned it to ash at a touch if he had.
Letting the sword vanish, he turned to examine the horses. Most had run away, but some not far,
and the woman’s tall gelding stood with rolling eyes, whickering uneasily. Her headless corpse, lying
on the ground, had maintained its grip on the reins, and held the animal’s head down.
Rand pulled them free, pausing only to gather his few belongings before swinging into the
saddle. I have to be careful, he thought as he looked over the dead. No mistakes.
The Power still filled him, the flow from saidin sweeter than honey, ranker than rotted meat.
Abruptly he channeled—not really understanding what it was he did, or how, only that it seemed
right; and it worked, lifting the corpses. He set them in a line, facing him, kneeling, faces in the dirt.
For those who had faces left. Kneeling to him.
“If I am the Dragon Reborn,” he told them, “that is the way it is supposed to be, isn’t it?” Letting
go of saidin was hard, but he did it. If I hold it too much, how will I keep the madness away? He
laughed bitterly. Or is it too late for that?
Frowning, he peered at the line. He had been sure there were only ten men, but eleven men knelt

in that line, one of them without armor of any sort but with a dagger still gripped in his hand.
“You chose the wrong company,” Rand told that man.
Wheeling the gelding, he dug in his heels and set the animal to a dead gallop into the night. It was
a long way to Tear, yet, but he meant to get there by the straightest way, if he had to kill horses or
steal them. I will put an end to it. The taunting. The baiting. I will end it! Callandor. It called to
him.

Fires in Cairhien

Egwene returned a graceful nod to the respectful bow of the ship’s crewman who padded past
her, barefoot, on his way to pull a rope that already seemed taut, possibly shifting a trifle the way one
of the big square sails set. As he trotted back toward where the round-faced captain stood by the
tillerman, he bowed again, and she nodded once more before returning her attentions to the forested
Cairhien shore, separated from the Blue Crane by less than twenty spans of water.
A village was sliding past, or what had been a village once. Half the houses were only
smoldering piles of rubble with chimneys sticking starkly out of the ruins. On the other houses, doors
swung with the wind, and pieces of furniture, bits of clothing and house ware littered the dirt street,
tumbled about as if thrown. Nothing living moved in the village except for one half-starved dog that
ignored the passing ship as it trotted out of sight behind the toppled walls of what appeared to have
been an inn. She could never see such a sight without a queasiness settling in her belly, but she tried
to maintain the dispassionate serenity she thought an Aes Sedai might have. It did not help much.
Beyond the village, a thick plume of smoke was rising into the sky. Three or four miles off, she
estimated.
This was not the first such plume of smoke she had seen since the Erinin began to flow along the
border of Cairhien, nor the first such village. At least this time there were no bodies in sight. Captain
Ellisor sometimes had to sail close to the Cairhienin shore because of mudflats—he said they shifted
in this part of the river—but however close he came, she had not seen a single living person.
The village and the smoke plume slipped away behind the ship, but already another column of
smoke was coming into view ahead, further from the river. The forest was thinning, ash and
leatherleaf and black elder giving way to willow and whitewood and wateroak, and some she did not
recognize.
The wind caught her cloak, but she let it stream, feeling the cold cleanness of the air, feeling the
freedom of wearing brown instead of any sort of white, though it had not been her first choice. Yet
dress and cloak were of the best wool, well cut and well sewn.
Another sailor trotted by, bowing as he went. She vowed to learn at least some of what it was
they were doing; she did not like feeling ignorant. Wearing her Great Serpent ring on her right hand
made for a good deal of bowing with a captain and crew born mainly in Tar Valon.
She had won that argument with Nynaeve, though Nynaeve had been sure she herself was the
only one of the three of them old enough for people to believe she was Aes Sedai. But Nynaeve had
been wrong. Egwene was ready to admit that both she and Elayne had received startled looks on
boarding the Blue Crane that afternoon at Southharbor, and Captain Ellisor’s eyebrows had climbed
almost to where his hair would have begun had he had any, but he had been all smiles and bows.
“An honor, Aes Sedai. Three Aes Sedai to travel on my vessel? An honor indeed. I promise you

a quick journey as far as you wish. And no trouble with Cairhienin brigands. I no longer put in on that
side of the river. Unless you wish it, of course, Aes Sedai. Andoran soldiers do hold a few towns on
the Cairhienin side. An honor, Aes Sedai.”
His eyebrows had shot up again when they asked for just one cabin among them—not even
Nynaeve wanted to be alone at night if she did not have to be. Each could have a cabin to herself at no
extra charge, he told them; he had no other passengers, his cargo was aboard, and if Aes Sedai had
urgent business downriver, he would not wait even an hour for anyone else who might want passage.
They said again that one cabin would be sufficient.
He was startled, and it had been plain from his face that he did not understand, but Chin Ellisor,
born and bred in Tar Valon, was not one to question Aes Sedai once they made their intentions clear.
If two of them seemed very young, well, some Aes Sedai were young.
The abandoned ruins vanished behind Egwene. The column of smoke drew closer, and there was
a hint of another much further still from the riverbank. The forest was turning to low, grassy hills
dotted with thickets. Trees that made flowers in the spring had them, tiny white blossoms on
snowberry and bright red sugarberry. One tree she did not know was covered in round white flowers
bigger than her two hands together. Occasionally a climbing wild-rose put swaths of yellow or white
through branches thick with the green of leaves and the red of new growth. It was all too sharp a
contrast to the ashes and rubble to be entirely pleasant.
Egwene wished she had an Aes Sedai to question herself right then. One she could trust.
Brushing her pouch with her fingers, she could barely feel the twisted stone ring of the ter’angreal
inside.
She had tried it every night but two since leaving Tar Valon, and it had not worked the same way
twice. Oh, she always found herself in Tel’aran’rhiod, but the only thing she saw that might have
been any use was the Heart of the Stone again, each time without Silvie to tell her things. There was
certainly nothing about the Black Ajah.
Her own dreams, without the ter’angreal, had been filled with images that seemed almost like
glimpses of the Unseen World. Rand holding a sword that blazed like the sun, till she could hardly
see that it was a sword, could hardly make out that it was him at all. Rand threatened in a dozen ways,
none of them the least bit real. In one dream he had been on a huge stones board, the black and white
stones as big as boulders, and him dodging the monstrous hands that moved them and seemed to try to
crush him under them. It could have meant something. It very probably did, but beyond the fact that
Rand was in danger from someone, or two someones—she thought that much was clear—beyond that,
she simply did not know. I cannot help him, now. I have my own duty. I don’t even know where he
is, except that it is probably five hundred leagues from here.
She had dreamed of Perrin with a wolf, and with a falcon, and a hawk—and the falcon and the
hawk fighting—of Perrin running from someone deadly, and Perrin stepping willingly over the edge
of a towering cliff while saying, “It must be done. I must learn to fly before I reach the bottom.” There
had been one dream of an Aiel, and she thought that had to do with Perrin, too, but she was not sure.
And a dream of Min, springing a steel trap but somehow walking through it without so much as seeing
it. There had been dreams of Mat, too. Of Mat with dice spinning ’round him—she felt she knew
where that one came from—of Mat being followed by a man who was not there—she still did not
understand that; there was a man following, or maybe more than one, but in some way there was no
one there—of Mat riding desperately toward something unseen in the distance that he had to reach,
and Mat with a woman who seemed to be tossing fireworks about. An Illuminator, she assumed, but
that made no more sense than anything else.

She had had so many dreams that she was beginning to doubt them all. Maybe it had to do with
using the ter’angreal so often, or maybe with just carrying it. Maybe she was finally learning what a
Dreamer did. Frantic dreams, hectic dreams. Men and women breaking out of a cage, then putting on
crowns. A woman playing with puppets, and another dream where the strings on puppets led to the
hands of larger puppets, and their strings led to still greater puppets, on and on until the last strings
vanished into unimaginable heights. Kings dying, queens weeping, battles raging. Whitecloaks
ravaging the Two Rivers. She had even dreamed of the Seanchan again. More than once. Those she
shut away in a dark corner; she would not let herself think of them. Her mother and father, every night.
She was certain what that meant, at least, or thought she was. It means I’m off hunting the Black
Ajah, and I do not know what my dreams mean or how to make the fool ter’angreal do what it
should, and I’m frightened, and. . . . And homesick. For an instant she thought how good it would be
to have her mother send her up to bed knowing everything would be better in the morning. Only
mother can’t solve my problems for me anymore, and father can’t promise to chase away monsters
and make me believe it. I have to do it myself now.
How far in the past all that was, now. She did not want it back, not really, but it had been a
warm time, and it seemed so long ago. It would be wonderful just to see them again, to hear their
voices. When I wear this ring on the finger I choose by right.
She had finally let Nynaeve and Elayne each try sleeping one night with the stone ring—
surprised at how reluctant she had been to let it out of her own hands—and they had awakened to
speak of what was surely Tel’aran’rhiod, but neither had seen more than a glimpse of the Heart of the
Stone, nothing that was of any use.
The thick column of smoke now lay abreast of the Blue Crane. Perhaps five or six miles from
the river, she thought. The other was only a smudge on the horizon. It could almost have been a cloud,
but she was sure it was not. Small thickets grew tight along the riverbank in some places, and
between them the grass came right down to the water except where an undercut bank had fallen in.
Elayne came on deck and joined her at the rail, the wind whipping her dark cloak as well. She
wore sturdy wool, too. That had been one argument Nynaeve won. Their clothes. Egwene had
maintained that Aes Sedai always wore the best, even when they traveled—she had been thinking of
the silks she wore in Tel’aran’rhiod—but Nynaeve pointed out that even with as much gold as the
Amyrlin had left in the back of her wardrobe, and it was a fat purse, they still had no idea how much
things would cost downriver. The servants said Mat had been right about the civil war in Cairhien,
and what it had done to prices. To Egwene’s surprise, Elayne had pointed out that Brown sisters
wore wool more often than silk. Elayne had been so eager to be away from the kitchen, Egwene
thought, she would have worn rags.
I wonder how Mat is doing? No doubt trying to dice with the captain for whatever ship he’s
traveling on.
“Terrible,” Elayne murmured. “It is so terrible.”
“What is?” Egwene said absently. I hope he isn’t showing that paper we gave him around too
freely.
Elayne gave her a startled look, and then a frown. “That!” She gestured toward the distant
smoke. “How can you ignore it?”
“I can ignore it because I do not want to think of what the people are going through, because I
cannot do anything about it, and because we have to reach Tear. Because what we’re hunting is in
Tear.” She was surprised at her own vehemence. I can’t do anything about it. And the Black Ajah is
in Tear.

The more she thought of it, the more certain she became that they would have to find a way into
the Heart of the Stone. Perhaps no one but the High Lords of Tear were allowed into it, but she was
becoming convinced that the key to springing the Black Ajah’s trap and thwarting them lay in the
Heart of the Stone.
“I know all of that, Egwene, but it does not stop me feeling for the Cairhienin.”
“I have heard lectures about the wars Andor fought with Cairhien,” Egwene said dryly. “Bennae
Sedai says you and Cairhien have fought more often than any two nations except Tear and Illian.”
The other woman gave her a sidelong look. Elayne had never gotten used to Egwene’s refusal to
admit she was Andoran herself. At least, lines on maps said the Two Rivers was part of Andor, and
Elayne believed the maps.
“We have fought wars against them, Egwene, but since the damage they suffered in the Aiel War,
Andor has sold them nearly as much grain as Tear has. The trade has stopped, now. With every
Cairhienin House fighting every other for the Sun Throne, who would buy the grain, or see it
distributed to the people? If the fighting is as bad as what we’ve seen on the banks. . . . Well. You
cannot feed a people for twenty years and feel nothing for them when they must be starving.”
“A Gray Man,” Egwene said, and Elayne jumped, trying to look in every direction at once. The
glow of saidar surrounded her.
“Where?”
Egwene took a slower look around the decks, but to make sure no one was close enough to
overhear. Captain Ellisor still stood in the stern, by the shirtless man holding the long tiller. Another
sailor was up in the very bow, scanning the waters ahead for signs of submerged mudbanks, and two
more padded about the deck, now and again adjusting a rope to the sails. The rest of the crew were
all below. One of the pair stopped to check the lashings on the rowboat tied upside down on the deck;
she waited for him to go on before speaking.
“Fool!” she muttered softly. “Me, Elayne, not you, so don’t glower at me like that.” She
continued in a whisper. “A Gray Man is after Mat, Elayne. That must be what that dream meant, but I
never saw it. I am a fool!”
The glow around Elayne vanished. “Do not be so hard on yourself,” she whispered back.
“Perhaps it does mean that, but I did not see it, and neither did Nynaeve.” She paused; red-gold curls
swung as she shook her head. “But it doesn’t make sense, Egwene. Why would a Gray Man be after
Mat? There is nothing in my letter to my mother that could harm us in the slightest.”
“I do not know why.” Egwene frowned. “There has to be a reason. I am sure that is what that
dream means.”
“Even if you are right, Egwene, there is nothing you can do about it.”
“I know that,” Egwene said bitterly. She did not even know whether he was ahead of them or
behind. Ahead, she suspected; Mat would have left without any delay. “Either way,” she muttered to
herself, “it does no good. I finally know what one of my dreams means, and it doesn’t help a
hemstitch worth!”
“But if you know one meaning,” Elayne told her, “perhaps now you will know others. If we sit
down and talk them over, perhaps—”
The Blue Crane gave a shuddering lurch, throwing Elayne to the deck and Egwene on top of her.
When Egwene struggled to her feet, the shoreline no longer slid by. The vessel had halted, with the
bow raised and the deck canted to one side. The sails flapped noisily in the wind.
Chin Ellisor pushed himself to his feet and ran for the bow, leaving the tillerman to rise on his
own. “You blind worm of a farmer!” he roared toward the man in the bow, who was clinging to the

rail to keep from falling the rest of the way over. “You dirt-grubbing get of a goat! Haven’t you been
on the river long enough yet to recognize how the water ruffles over a mudflat?” He seized the man on
the rail by the shoulders and pulled him back onto the deck, but only to shove him out of the way so he
could peer down over the bow himself. “If you’ve put a hole in my hull, I will use your guts for
caulking!”
The other crewmen were clambering to their feet, now, and more came scrambling up from
below. They all ran to cluster around the captain.
Nynaeve appeared at the head of the ladder that led down to the passenger cabins, still
straightening her skirts. With a sharp tug at her braid, she frowned at the knot of men in the bow, then
strode to Egwene and Elayne. “He ran us onto something, did he? After all his talk of knowing the
river as well as he knows his wife. The woman probably never receives as much as a smile from
him.” She jerked the thick braid again and went forward, pushing her way through the sailors to reach
the captain. They were all intent on the water below.
There was no point in joining her. He will have us off faster if he’s left to it. Nynaeve was
probably telling him how to do the work. Elayne seemed to feel the same way, from the rueful shake
of the head she gave as she watched the captain and crewmen all turn their attention respectfully from
whatever was under the bow to Nynaeve.
A ripple of agitation ran through the men, and grew stronger. For a moment the captain’s hands
could be seen, waving in protest over the other men’s heads, and then Nynaeve was striding away
from them—they made way, bowing now—with Ellisor hurrying beside her and mopping his round
face with a large red handkerchief. His anxious voice became audible as they drew near.
“. . . a good fifteen miles to the next village on the Andor side, Aes Sedai, and at least five or six
miles downriver on the Cairhien side! Andoran soldiers hold it, it is true, but they do not hold the
miles from here to there!” He wiped at his face as if he were dripping sweat.
“A sunken ship,” Nynaeve told the the other two women. “The work of river brigands, the
captain thinks. He means to try backing off it with the sweeps, but he does not seem to think that will
work.”
“We were running fast when we hit, Aes Sedai. I wanted to make good speed for you.” Ellisor
rubbed even harder at his face. He was afraid the Aes Sedai would blame him, Egwene realized.
“We are stuck hard. But I do not think we are taking water, Aes Sedai. There is no need to worry.
Another ship will be along. Two sets of sweeps will surely get us free. There is no need for you to be
put ashore, Aes Sedai. I do swear it, by the Light.”
“You were thinking of leaving the ship?” Egwene asked. “Do you think that is wise?”
“Of course, it’s—!” Nynaeve stopped and frowned at her. Egwene returned the frown with a
level stare. Nynaeve went on in a calmer tone, if still a tight one. “The captain says it may be an hour
before another ship comes along. One with enough sweeps to make a difference. Or a day. Or two,
maybe. I do not think we can afford to waste a day or two waiting. We can be in this village—what
did you call it, Captain? Jurene?—we can walk to Jurene in two hours or less. If Captain Ellisor
frees his vessel as quickly as he hopes, we can reboard then. He says he will stop to see if we are
there. If he does not get free, though, we can take ship from Jurene. We may even find a vessel
waiting. The captain says traders do stop there, because of the Andoran soldiers.” She drew a deep
breath, but her voice grew tighter. “Have I explained my reasoning fully enough? Do you need more?”
“It is clear to me,” Elayne put in quickly before Egwene could speak. “And it sounds a good
idea. You think it is a good idea, too, don’t you, Egwene?”
Egwene gave a grudging nod. “I suppose it is.”

“But, Aes Sedai,” Ellisor protested, “at least go to the Andor bank. The war, Aes Sedai.
Brigands, and every sort of ruffian, and the soldiers not much better. The very wreck under our bow
shows the sort of men they are.”
“We have not seen a living soul on the Cairhien side,” Nynaeve said, “and in any case, we are
far from defenseless, Captain. And I will not walk fifteen miles when I can walk six.”
“Of course, Aes Sedai.” Ellisor really was sweating, now. “I did not mean to suggest. . . . Of
course you are not defenseless, Aes Sedai. I did not mean to suggest it.” He wiped his face furiously,
but it still glistened.
Nynaeve opened her mouth, glanced at Egwene, and seemed to change what she had intended to
say. “I am going below for my things,” she told the air halfway between Egwene and Elayne, then
turned on Ellisor. “Captain, make your rowboat ready.” He bowed and scurried away even before
she turned for the hatch, and was shouting for men to put the boat over the side before she was below.
“If one of you says ‘up,’ ” Elayne murmured, “the other says ‘down.’ If you do not stop it, we
may not reach Tear.”
“We will reach Tear,” Egwene said. “And sooner once Nynaeve realizes she is not the Wisdom
any longer. We are all”—she did not say Accepted; there were two many men hurrying about—“on
the same level, now.” Elayne sighed.
In short order the rowboat had ferried them ashore, and they were standing on the bank with
walking staffs in hand, their belongings in bundles on their backs, and hung about them in pouches and
scripts. Rolling grassland and scattered copses surrounded them, though the hills were forested a few
miles in from the river. The sweeps on the Blue Crane were cutting up froth, but failing to budge the
vessel. Egwene turned and started south without another glance. And before Nynaeve could take the
lead.
When the others caught up to her, Elayne gave her a reproving look. Nynaeve walked staring
straight ahead. Elayne told Nynaeve what Egwene had said about Mat and a Gray Man, but the older
woman listened in silence and only said, “He’ll have to look after himself,” without pausing in her
stride. After a time, the Daughter-Heir gave up trying to make the other two talk, and they all walked
in silence.
Clumps of trees close along the riverbank soon hid the Blue Crane, thick growths of wateroak
and willow. They did not go through the copses, small as they were, for anything at all might be
hiding in the shadows under their branches. A few low bushes grew scattered between the thickets
here close to the river, but they were too sparse to hide a child much less a brigand, and they were
widely spaced.
“If we do see brigands,” Egwene announced, “I am going to defend myself. There is no Amyrlin
looking over our shoulders here.”
Nynaeve’s mouth thinned. “If need be,” she told the air in front of her, “we can frighten off any
brigands the way we did those Whitecloaks. If we can find no other way.”
“I wish you would not talk of brigands,” Elayne said. “I would like to reach this village without
—”
A figure in brown and gray rose from behind a bush standing by itself almost in front of them.

CHAPTER
38

Maidens of the Spear

Egwene embraced saidar before the scream was well out of her mouth, and she saw the glow
around Elayne, too. For an instant she wondered if Ellisor had heard their screams and would send
help; the Blue Crane could not be more than a mile upriver. Then she was dismissing the need for
help, already weaving flows of Air and Fire into lightning. She could almost still hear their yelling.
Nynaeve was simply standing there with her arms crossed beneath her breasts and a firm
expression on her face, but Egwene was not sure whether that was because she was not angry enough
to touch the True Source, or because she had already seen what Egwene was just now seeing. The
person facing them was a woman no older than Egwene herself, if somewhat taller.
She did not let go of saidar. Men were sometimes silly enough to think a woman was harmless
merely because she was a woman; Egwene had no such illusions. In a corner of her mind she noted
that Elayne was no longer surrounded by the glow. The Daughter-Heir must still harbor foolish
notions. She was never a Seanchan prisoner.
Egwene did not think many men would be stupid enough to think the woman in front of them was
not dangerous, even though her hands were empty and she wore no visible weapon. Blue-green eyes
and reddish hair cut short except for a narrow tail that hung to her shoulders; soft, laced knee-boots
and close-fitting coat and breeches all in the shades of earth and rock. Such coloring and clothing had
been described to her once; this woman was Aiel.
Looking at her, Egwene felt a sudden odd affinity for the woman. She could not understand it.
She looks like Rand’s cousin, that’s why. Yet even that feeling—almost of kinship—could not stifle
her curiosity. What under the Light are Aiel doing here? They never leave the Waste; not since the
Aiel War. She had heard all of her life how deadly Aiel were—these Maidens of the Spear no less
than the members of the male warrior societies—but she felt no particular fear and, indeed, some
irritation at having been afraid. With saidar feeding the One Power into her, she had no need to fear
anyone. Except maybe a fully trained sister, she admitted. But certainly not one woman, even if she
is Aiel.
“My name is Aviendha,” the Aiel woman said, “of the Nine Valleys sept of the Taardad Aiel.”
Her face was as flat and expressionless as her voice. “I am Far Dareis Mai, a Maiden of the Spear.”
She paused a moment, studying them. “You have not the look in your faces, but we saw the rings. In
your lands, you have women much like our Wise Ones, the women called Aes Sedai. Are you women
of the White Tower, or not?”
For a moment Egwene did feel unease. We? She looked around them carefully, but saw no one
behind any bush within twenty paces.
If there were others, they had to be in the next thicket, more than two hundred paces ahead, or in
the last one, twice that distance behind. Too far to threaten. Unless they have bows. But they would

have to be good with them. Back home, in the competitions at Bel Tine and Sunday, only the best
bowmen shot at any distance much beyond two hundred paces.
But she still felt better knowing she could hurl a lightning bolt at anyone who tried such a shot.
“We are women of the White Tower,” Nynaeve said calmly. She was very obvious in not
looking around for other Aiel. Even Elayne was peering about. “Whether you would consider any of
us wise is another matter,” Nynaeve went on. “What do you want of us?”
Aviendha smiled. She was really quite lovely, Egwene realized; the grim expression had masked
it. “You talk as the Wise Ones do. To the point, and small suffering of fools.” Her smile faded, but
her voice remained calm. “One of us lies gravely hurt, perhaps dying. The Wise Ones often heal those
who would surely die without them, and I have heard Aes Sedai can do more. Will you aid her?”
Egwene almost shook her head in confusion. A friend of hers is dying? She sounds as if she is
asking if we’ll lend her a cup of barley flour!
“I will help her if I can,” Nynaeve said slowly. “I cannot make promises, Aviendha. She may die
despite anything I can do.”
“Death comes for us all,” the Aiel said. “We can only choose how to face it when it comes. I
will take you to her.”
Two women in Aiel garb stood up no more than ten paces away, one out of a little fold in the
ground that Egwene would not have supposed could hide a dog, and the other in grass that reached
only halfway to her knees. They lowered their black veils as they stood—that gave her another jolt;
she was sure Elayne had told her the Aiel only hid their faces when they might have to do killing—
and settled the cloth that had wrapped their heads about their shoulders. One had the same reddish
hair as Aviendha, with gray eyes, the other dark blue eyes and hair like fire. Neither was any older
than Egwene or Elayne, and both looked ready to use the short spears in their hands.
The woman with fiery hair handed Aviendha weapons; a long, heavy-bladed knife to belt at her
waist, and a bristling quiver for the other side; a dark, curved bow that had the dull shine of horn, in a
case to fasten on her back; and four short spears with long points to grip in her left hand along with a
small, round hide buckler. Aviendha wore them as naturally as a woman in Emond’s Field would
wear a scarf, just as her companions did. “Come,” she said, and started for the thicket they had
already passed.
Egwene finally released saidar. She suspected all three of the Aiel could stab her with those
spears before she could do anything about it, if that was what they wanted, but though they were wary,
she did not think they would. And what if Nynaeve can’t Heal their friend? I wish she would ask
before she makes these decisions that involve all of us!
As they headed for the trees, the Aiel scanned the land around them as if they expected the empty
landscape to hold enemies as adept at hiding as themselves. Aviendha strode ahead, and Nynaeve
kept up with her.
“I am Elayne of House Trakand,” Egwene’s friend said as if making conversation, “DaughterHeir to Morgase, Queen of Andor.”
Egwene stumbled. Light, is she mad? I know Andor fought them in the Aiel War. It might be
twenty years, but they say Aiel have long memories.
But the flame-haired Aiel closest to her only said, “I am Bain, of the Black Rock sept of the
Shaarad Aiel.”
“I am Chiad,” the shorter, blonder woman on her other side said, “of the Stones River sept of the
Goshien Aiel.”
Bain and Chiad glanced at Egwene; their expressions did not change, but she had the feeling they

thought she was showing bad manners.
“I am Egwene al’Vere,” she told them. They seemed to expect more, so she added, “Daughter of
Marin al’Vere, of Emond’s Field, in the Two Rivers.” That seemed to satisfy them, in a way, but she
would have bet they understood it no more than she did all these septs and clans. It must mean
families, in some way.
“You are first-sisters?” Bain seemed to be taking in all three of them.
Egwene thought they must mean sisters as it was used for Aes Sedai, and said “Yes,” just as
Elayne said “No.”
Chiad and Bain exchanged a very quick look that suggested they were talking to women who
might not be completely whole in their minds.
“First-sister,” Elayne told Egwene as if she were lecturing, “means women who have the same
mother. Second-sister means their mothers are sisters.” She turned her words to the Aiel. “We neither
of us know a great deal of your people. I ask you to excuse our ignorance. I sometimes think of
Egwene as a first-sister, but we are not blood kin.”
“Then why do you not speak the words before your Wise Ones?” Chiad asked. “Bain and I
became first-sisters.”
Egwene blinked. “How can you become first-sisters? Either you have the same mother, or you
do not. I do not mean to offend. Most of what I know about the Maidens of the Spear comes from the
little Elayne has told me. I know you fight in battle and don’t care for men, but no more than that.”
Elayne nodded; the way she had described the Maidens to Egwene had sounded much like a cross
between female Warders and the Red Ajah.
That look flashed back across the Aiel’s faces, as if they were not certain how much sense
Egwene and Elayne had.
“We do not care for men?” Chiad murmured as if puzzled.
Bain knotted her brow in thought. “What you say comes near truth, yet misses it completely.
When we wed the spear, we pledge to be bound to no man or child. Some do give up the spear, for a
man or a child”—her expression said she herself did not understand this—“but once given up, the
spear cannot be taken back.”
“Or if she is chosen to go to Rhuidean,” Chiad put in. “A Wise One cannot be wedded to the
spear.”
Bain looked at her as if she had announced the sky was blue, or that rain fell from clouds. The
glance she gave Egwene and Elayne said perhaps they did not know these things. “Yes, that is true.
Though some try to struggle against it.”
“Yes, they do.” Chiad sounded as though she and Bain were sharing something between them.
“But I have gone far from the trail of my explanation,” Bain went on. “The Maidens do not dance
the spears with one another even when our clans do, but the Shaarad Aiel and the Goshien Aiel have
held blood feud between them over four hundred years, so Chiad and I felt our wedding pledge was
not enough. We went to speak the words before the Wise Ones of our clans—she risking her life in
my hold, and I in hers—to bond us as first-sisters. As is proper for first-sisters who are Maidens, we
guard each other’s backs, and neither will let a man come to her without the other. I would not say we
do not care for men.” Chiad nodded, with just the hint of a smile. “Have I made the truth clear to you,
Egwene?”
“Yes,” Egwene said faintly. She glanced at Elayne and saw the bewilderment in her blue eyes
she knew must be in her own. Not Red Ajah. Green, maybe. A cross between Warders and Green
Ajah, and I do not understand another thing out of that. “The truth is quite clear to me, now, Bain.

Thank you.”
“If the two of you feel you are first-sisters,” Chiad said, “you should go to your Wise Ones and
speak the words. But you are Wise Ones, though young. I do not know how it would be done in that
case.”
Egwene did not know whether to laugh or blush. She kept having an image of her and Elayne
sharing the same man. No, that is only for first-sisters who are Maidens of the Spear. Isn’t it?
Elayne did have spots of color in her cheeks, and Egwene was sure she was thinking of Rand. But we
do not share him, Elayne. We can neither of us have him.
Elayne cleared her throat. “I do not think there is a need for that, Chiad. Egwene and I already
guard each other’s backs.”
“How can that be?” Chiad asked slowly. “You are not wedded to the spear. And you are Wise
Ones. Who would lift a hand against a Wise One? This confuses me. What need have you for guarding
of backs?”
Egwene was spared having to come up with an answer by their arrival at the copse. There were
two more Aiel under the trees, deep into the thicket, but next to the river. Jolien, of the Salt Flat sept
of the Nakai Aiel, a blue-eyed woman with red-gold hair nearly the color of Elayne’s, was watching
over Dailin, of Aviendha’s sept and clan. Sweat matted Dailin’s hair, making it a darker red, and she
only opened her gray eyes once, when they first came near, then closed them again. Her coat and shirt
lay beside her, and red stained the bandages wrapped around her middle.
“She took a sword,” Aviendha said. “Some of those fools that the oath-breaking treekillers call
soldiers thought we were another handful of the bandits who infest this land. We had to kill them to
convince them otherwise, but Dailin. . . . Can you heal her, Aes Sedai?”
Nynaeve went to her knees beside the injured woman and lifted the bandages enough to peer
under them. She winced at what she saw. “Have you moved her since she was hurt? There is
scabbing, but it has been broken.”
“She wanted to die near water,” Aviendha said. She glanced once at the river, then quickly away
again. Egwene thought she might have shivered, too.
“Fools!” Nynaeve began rummaging in her pouch of herbs. “You could have killed her moving
her with an injury like that. She wanted to die near water!” she said disgustedly. “Just because you
carry weapons like men doesn’t mean you have to think like them.” She pulled a deep wooden cup out
of the bag and pushed it at Chiad. “Fill that. I need water to mix these so she can drink them.”
Chiad and Bain stepped to the river’s edge and returned together. Their faces never changed, but
Egwene thought they had almost expected the river to reach up and grab them.
“If we had not brought her here to the . . . river, Aes Sedai,” Aviendha said, “we would never
have found you, and she would have died anyway.”
Nynaeve snorted and began sifting powdered herbs into the cup of water, muttering to herself.
“Corenroot helps make blood, and dogwort for knitting flesh, and healall, of course, and. . . .” Her
mutters trailed off into whispers too low to hear. Aviendha was frowning at her.
“The Wise Ones use herbs, Aes Sedai, but I had not heard that Aes Sedai used them.”
“I use what I use!” Nynaeve snapped and went back to sorting through her powders and
whispering to herself.
“She truly does sound like a Wise One,” Chiad told Bain softly, and the other woman gave a
tight nod.
Dailin was the only Aiel without her weapons in hand, and they all looked ready to use them in a
heartbeat. Nynaeve surely isn’t soothing anyone , Egwene thought. Get them talking about

something. Anything. Nobody feels like fighting if they’re talking of something peaceful.
“Do not be offended,” she said carefully, “but I notice you are all uneasy about the river. It does
not grow violent unless there is a storm. You could swim in it if you wanted, though the current is
strong away from the banks.” Elayne shook her head.
The Aiel looked blank; Aviendha said, “I saw a man—a Shienaran—do this swimming . . .
once.”
“I don’t understand,” Egwene said. “I know there isn’t much water in the Waste, but you said
you were ‘Stones River sept,’ Jolien. Surely you have swum in the Stones River?” Elayne looked at
her as if she were mad.
“Swim,” Jolien said awkwardly. “It means . . . to get in the water? All that water? With nothing
to hold on to.” She shuddered. “Aes Sedai, before I crossed the Dragonwall, I had never seen flowing
water I could not step across. The Stones River. . . . Some claim it had water in it once, but that is
only boasting. There are only the stones. The oldest records of the Wise Ones and the clan chief say
there was never anything but stones since the first day our sept broke off from the High Plain sept and
claimed that land. Swim!” She gripped her spears as if to fight the very word. Chiad and Bain moved
a pace further from the riverbank.
Egwene sighed. And colored when she met Elayne’s eye. Well, I am not a Daughter-Heir, to
know all these things. I will learn them, though. As she looked around at the Aiel women, she
realized that far from soothing them, she had put them even more on edge. If they try anything, I will
hold them with Air. She had no idea whether she could seize four people at once, but she opened
herself to saidar, wove the flows in Air and held them ready. The Power pulsed in her with
eagerness to be used. No glow surrounded Elayne, and she wondered why. Elayne looked right at her
and shook her head.
“I would never harm an Aes Sedai,” Aviendha said abruptly. “I would have you know that.
Whether Dailin lives or dies, it makes no difference in that. I would never use this”—she lifted one
short spear a trifle—“against any woman. And you are Aes Sedai.” Egwene had the sudden feeling
that the woman was trying to soothe them.
“I knew that,” Elayne said, as if talking to Aviendha, but her eyes told Egwene the words were
for her. “No one knows much of your people, but I was taught that Aiel never harm women unless they
are—what did you call it?—wedded to the spear.”
Bain seemed to think Elayne was failing to see truth clearly again. “That is not exactly the way
of it, Elayne. If a woman not wedded came at me with weapons, I would drub her until she knew
better of it. A man. . . . A man might think a woman of your lands was wedded if she bore weapons; I
do not know. Men can be strange.”
“Of course,” Elayne said. “But so long as we do not attack you with weapons, you will not try to
harm us.” All four Aiel looked shocked, and she gave Egwene a quick significant look.
Egwene held on to saidar anyway. Just because Elayne had been taught something did not mean
it was true, even if the Aiel said the same thing. And saidar felt . . . good in her.
Nynaeve lifted up Dailin’s head and began pouring her mixture into the woman’s mouth.
“Drink,” she said firmly. “I know it tastes bad, but drink it all.” Dailin swallowed, choked, and
swallowed again.
“Not even then, Aes Sedai,” Aviendha told Elayne. She kept her eyes on Dailin and Nynaeve,
though. “It is said that once, before the Breaking of the World, we served the Aes Sedai, though no
story says how. We failed in that service. Perhaps that is the sin that sent us to the Three-fold Land; I
do not know. No one knows what the sin was, except maybe the Wise Ones, or the clan chiefs, and

they do not say. It is said if we fail the Aes Sedai again, they will destroy us.”
“Drink it all,” Nynaeve muttered. “Swords! Swords and muscles and no brains!”
“We are not going to destroy you,” Elayne said firmly, and Aviendha nodded.
“As you say, Aes Sedai. But the old stories are all clear on one point. We must never fight Aes
Sedai. If you bring your lightnings and your balefire against me, I will dance with them, but I will not
harm you.”
“Stabbing people,” Nynaeve growled. She lowered Dailin’s head, and laid a hand on the
woman’s brow. Dailin’s eyes had closed again. “Stabbing women!” Aviendha shifted her feet and
frowned again, and she was not alone among the Aiel.
“Balefire,” Egwene said. “Aviendha, what is balefire?”
The Aiel woman turned her frown on her. “Do you not know, Aes Sedai? In the old stories, Aes
Sedai wielded it. The stories make it a fearsome thing, but I know no more. It is said we have
forgotten much that we once knew.”
“Perhaps the White Tower has forgotten much, too,” Egwene said. I knew of it in that . . .
dream, or whatever it was. It was as real as Tel’aran’rhiod. I’d gamble with Mat on that.
“No right!” Nynaeve snapped. “No one has a right to tear bodies so! It is not right!”
“Is she angry?” Aviendha asked uneasily. Chiad and Bain and Jolien exchanged worried looks.
“It is all right,” Elayne said.
“It is better than all right,” Egwene added. “She is getting angry, and it is much better than all
right.”
The glow of saidar surrounded Nynaeve suddenly—Egwene leaned forward, trying to see, and
so did Elayne—and Dailin started up with a scream, eyes wide open. In an instant, Nynaeve was
easing her back down, and the glow faded. Dailin’s eyes slid shut, and she lay there panting.
I saw it, Egwene thought. I . . . think I did. She was not sure she had even been able to make out
all the many flows, much less the way Nynaeve had woven them together. What Nynaeve had done in
those few seconds had seemed like weaving four carpets at once while blindfolded.
Nynaeve used the bloody bandages to wipe Dailin’s stomach, smearing away bright red new
blood and black crusts of dried old. There was no wound, no scar, only healthy skin considerably
paler than Dailin’s face.
With a grimace, Nynaeve took the bloody cloths, stood up, and threw them into the river. “Wash
the rest of that off of her,” she said, “and put some clothes back on her. She’s cold. And be ready to
feed her. She will be hungry.” She knelt by the water to wash her hands.

CHAPTER
39

Threads in the Pattern

Jolien put an unsteady hand to where the wound had been in Dailin’s middle; when she touched
smooth skin, she gasped as if she had not believed her own eyes.
Nynaeve straightened, drying her hands on her cloak. Egwene had to admit that good wool did
better for a towel than silk or velvet. “I said wash her and get some clothes on her,” Nynaeve
snapped.
“Yes, Wise One,” Jolien said quickly, and she, Chiad, and Bain all leaped to obey.
A short laugh burst from Aviendha, a laugh almost at the edge of tears. “I have heard that a Wise
One in the Jagged Spire sept is said to be able to do this, and one in the Four Holes sept, but I always
thought it was boasting.” She drew a deep breath, regaining her composure. “Aes Sedai, I owe you a
debt. My water is yours, and the shade of my septhold will welcome you. Dailin is my second-sister.”
She saw Nynaeve’s uncomprehending look and added, “She is my mother’s sister’s daughter. Close
blood, Aes Sedai. I owe a blood debt.”
“If I have any blood to spill,” Nynaeve said dryly, “I will spill it myself. If you wish to repay
me, tell me if there is a ship at Jurene. The next village south of here?”
“The village where the soldiers fly the White Lion banner?” Aviendha said. “There was a ship
there when I scouted yesterday. The old stories mention ships, but it was strange to see one.”
“The Light send it is still there.” Nynaeve began putting away her folded papers of powdered
herbs. “I have done what I can for the girl, Aviendha, and we must go on. All that she needs now is
food and rest. And try not to let people stick swords in her.”
“What comes, comes, Aes Sedai,” the Aiel woman replied.
“Aviendha,” Egwene said, “feeling as you do about rivers, how do you cross them? I am sure
there is at least one river nearly as big as the Erinin between here and the Waste.”
“The Alguenya,” Elayne said. “Unless you went around it.”
“You have many rivers, but some have things called bridges where we had need to cross, and
others we could wade. For the rest, Jolien remembered that wood floats.” She slapped the trunk of a
tall whitewood. “These are big, but they float as well as a branch. We found dead ones and made
ourselves a . . . ship . . . a little ship, of two or three lashed together to cross the big river.” She said
it matter-of-factly.
Egwene stared in wonder. If she were as afraid of something as the Aiel obviously were of
rivers, could she make herself face it the way they did? She did not think so. What about the Black
Ajah, a small voice asked. Have you stopped being afraid of them? That is different, she told it.
There’s no bravery in that. I either hunt them, or else I sit like a rabbit waiting for a hawk. She
quoted the old saying to herself. “It is better to be the hammer than the nail.”
“We had best be on our way,” Nynaeve said.

“In a moment,” Elayne told her. “Aviendha, why have you come all this way and put up with
such hardship?”
Aviendha shook her head disgustedly. “We have not come far at all; we were among the last to
set out. The Wise Ones nipped at me like wild dogs circling a calf, saying I had other duties.”
Suddenly she grinned, gesturing to the other Aiel. “These stayed back to taunt me in my misery, so
they said, but I do not think the Wise Ones would have let me go if they had not been there to
companion me.”
“We seek the one foretold,” Bain said. She was holding a sleeping Dailin so Chiad could slip a
shirt of brown linen onto her. “He Who Comes With the Dawn.”
“He will lead us out of the Three-fold Land,” Chiad added. “The prophecies say he was born of
Far Dareis Mai.”
Elayne looked startled. “I thought you said the Maidens of the Spear were not allowed to have
children. I am sure I was taught that.” Bain and Chiad exchanged those looks again, as if Elayne had
come near truth and yet missed it once more.
“If a Maiden bears a child,” Aviendha explained carefully, “she gives the child to the Wise Ones
of her sept, and they pass the child to another woman in such a way that none knows whose child it
is.” She, too, sounded as if she were explaining that stone is hard. “Every woman wants to foster such
a child in the hope she may raise He Who Comes With the Dawn.”
“Or she may give up the spear and wed the man,” Chiad said, and Bain added, “There are
sometimes reasons one must give up the spear.”
Aviendha gave them a level look, but continued as if they had not spoken. “Except that now the
Wise Ones say he is to be found here, beyond the Dragonwall. ‘Blood of our blood mixed with the
old blood, raised by an ancient blood not ours.’ I do not understand it, but the Wise Ones spoke in
such a way as to leave no doubts.” She paused, obviously choosing her words. “You have asked
many questions, Aes Sedai. I wish to ask one. You must understand that we look for omens and signs.
Why do three Aes Sedai walk a land where the only hand without a knife in it is a hand too weak with
hunger to grasp the hilt? Where do you go?”
“Tear,” Nynaeve said briskly, “unless we stay here talking until the Heart of the Stone crumbles
to dust.” Elayne began adjusting the cord of her bundle and the strap of her scrip for walking, and
after a moment Egwene did the same.
The Aiel women were looking at one another, Jolien frozen in the act of closing Dailin’s graybrown coat. “Tear?” Aviendha said in a cautious tone. “Three Aes Sedai walking through a troubled
land on their way to Tear. This is a strange thing. Why do you go to Tear, Aes Sedai?”
Egwene glanced at Nynaeve. Light, a moment ago they were laughing, and now they’re as
tense as they ever were.
“We hunt some evil women,” Nynaeve said carefully. “Dark friends.”
“Shadowrunners.” Jolien twisted her mouth around the word as if she had bitten into a rotten
apple.
“Shadowrunners in Tear,” Bain said, and as if part of the same sentence Chiad added, “And
three Aes Sedai seeking the Heart of the Stone.”
“I did not say we were going to the Heart of the Stone,” Nynaeve said sharply. “I merely said I
did not want to stay here till it falls to dust. Egwene, Elayne, are you ready?” She started out of the
thicket without waiting for an answer, walking staff thumping the ground and long strides carrying her
south.
Egwene and Elayne made hasty goodbyes before following after her. The four Aiel on their feet

stood watching them go.
When the two of them were a little way beyond the trees, Egwene said, “My heart almost
stopped when you named yourself. Weren’t you afraid they might try to kill you, or to take you
prisoner? The Aiel War was not that long ago, and whatever they said about not harming women who
don’t carry spears, they looked ready enough to use those spears on anything, to me.”
Elayne shook her head ruefully. “I have just learned how much I do not know about the Aiel, but
I was taught that they do not think of the Aiel War as a war at all. From the way they behaved toward
me, I think maybe that much of what I learned is truth. Or maybe it was because they think I am Aes
Sedai.”
“I know they are strange, Elayne, but no one can call three years of battles anything but a war. I
do not care how much they fight among themselves, a war is a war.”
“Not to them. Thousands of Aiel crossed the Spine of the World, but apparently they saw
themselves more like thief-takers, or headsmen, come after King Laman of Cairhien for the crime of
cutting down Avendoraldera. To the Aiel, it was not a war; it was an execution.”
Avendoraldera, according to one of Verin’s lectures, had been an offshoot of the Tree of Life
itself, brought to Cairhien some five hundred years ago as an unprecedented offer of peace from the
Aiel, given along with the right to cross the Waste, a right otherwise given to none but peddlers,
gleemen, and the Tuatha’an. Much of Cairhien’s wealth had been built on the trade in ivory and
perfumes and spices and, most of all, silk, from the lands beyond the Waste. Not even Verin had any
idea of how the Aiel had come by a sapling of Avendesora—for one thing, the old books were clear
that it made no seed; for another, no one knew where the Tree of Life was, except for a few stories
that were clearly wrong, but surely the Tree of Life could have nothing to do with the Aiel—or of
why the Aiel had called the Cairhienin the Watersharers, or insisted their trains of merchant wagons
fly a banner bearing the trefoil leaf of Avendesora.
Egwene supposed, grudgingly, that she could understand why they had started a war—even if
they did not think it was one—after King Laman cut down their gift to make a throne unlike any other
in the world. Laman’s Sin, she had heard it called. According to Verin, not only had Cairhien’s trade
across the Waste ended with the war, but those Cairhienin who ventured into the Waste now
vanished. Verin claimed they were said to be “sold as animals” in the lands beyond the Waste, but not
even she understood how a man or a woman could be sold.
“Egwene,” Elayne said, “you know who He Who Comes With the Dawn must be, don’t you?”
Staring at Nynaeve’s back still well ahead of them, Egwene shook her head—Does she mean to
race us to Jurene?—then almost stopped walking. “You do not mean—?”
Elayne nodded. “I think so. I do not know much of the Prophecies of the Dragon, but I have heard
a few lines. One I remember is, ‘On the slopes of Dragonmount shall he be born, born of a maiden
wedded to no man.’ Egwene, Rand does look like an Aiel. Well, he looks like the pictures I have
seen of Tigraine, too, but she vanished before he was born, and I hardly think she could have been his
mother anyway. I think Rand’s mother was a Maiden of the Spear.”
Egwene frowned in thought as she hurried along, running everything she knew of Rand’s birth
through her head. He had been raised by Tam al’Thor after Kari al’Thor died, but if what Moiraine
said was true, they could not be his real mother and father. Nynaeve had sometimes seemed to know
some secret about Rand’s birth. But I will bet I couldn’t pry it out of her with a fork!
They caught up to Nynaeve, Egwene glowering as she thought, Nynaeve staring straight ahead
toward Jurene and that ship, and Elayne frowning at the pair of them as if they were two children
sulking over who should have the larger piece of cake.

After a time of silent strides, Elayne said, “You handled that very well, Nynaeve. The Healing,
and the rest, too. I do not think they ever doubted you were Aes Sedai. Or that we all were, because
of the way you bore yourself.”
“You did do a good job,” Egwene said after a minute. “That was the first time I have ever really
watched what is done during a Healing. It makes making lightning look like mixing oatcake.”
A surprised smile appeared on Nynaeve’s face. “Thank you,” she murmured, and reached over
to give Egwene’s hair a little tug the way she had when Egwene was a little girl.
I am not a little girl any longer. The moment passed as quickly as it had come, and they went on
in silence once more. Elayne sighed loudly.
They covered another mile, or a little more, swiftly, despite swinging in from the river to go
around the thickets along the bank. Nynaeve insisted on staying well clear of the trees. Egwene
thought it was silly to think more Aiel would be hiding in the copses, but the swing inland did not add
much distance to what they had to cover; none of the growths were very big.
Elayne watched the trees, though, and she was the one who suddenly screamed, “Look out!”
Egwene jerked her head around; men were stepping out from among the trees, slings whirling
’round their heads. She reached for saidar, and something struck her head, and darkness drank
everything.
Egwene could feel herself swaying, feel something moving under her. Her head seemed to be
nothing but pain. She tried to raise a hand to her temples, but something dug into her wrists, and her
hands did not move.
“—better than lying there all day waiting for dark,” a man’s rough voice said. “Who knows if
another ship would come by close in? And I don’t trust that boat. It leaks.”
“You do better hope Adden does believe you did see those rings before you did decide,” another
man said. “He does want fat cargoes, not women, I think.” the first man muttered something coarse
about what Adden could do with his leaky boat, and the cargoes, too.
Her eyes opened. Silver-flecked spots danced across her vision; she thought she might be going
to throw up on the ground swaying past under her head. She was tied across the back of a horse, her
wrists and ankles joined by a rope running under its belly, her hair hanging down.
It was still daylight. She craned her neck to look around. So many rough-dressed men on horses
surrounded her that she could not see whether Nynaeve and Elayne had been captured, as well. Some
of the men wore bits of armor—a battered helmet, or a dented breastplate, or a jerkin sewn all over
with metal scales—but most wore only coats that had not been cleaned in months, if ever. From the
smell, the men had not cleaned themselves in months, either. They all wore swords, at their waists or
on their backs.
Rage hit her, and fear, but most of all white-hot anger. I won’t be a prisoner. I won’t be bound!
I won’t! She reached for saidar and the pain nearly lifted the top of her head; she barely stifled a
moan.
The horse paused for a moment of shouts and the creak of rusty hinges, then went ahead a little
further, and the men began to dismount. As they moved apart, she could see something of where they
were. A log palisade surrounded them, built atop a large, round earthen mound, and men with bows
stood guard on a wooden walk built just high enough for them to see over the rough-hewn ends of the
logs. One low, windowless log house seemed to be built into the mounded dirt under the wall. There
was no other structure beyond a few lean-to sheds. Aside from the men and horses that had just
entered, the rest of the open space was filled with cook fires, and tethered horses, and more

unwashed men. There must have been at least a hundred. Caged goats and pigs and chickens filled the
air with squeals and grunts and clucks that blended with coarse shouts and laughter to make a din that
pierced her head.
Her eyes found Nynaeve and Elayne, bound head down across saddleless horses as she was.
Neither seemed to be stirring; the very end of Nynaeve’s braid dragged across the dirt as her horse
stirred. A small hope faded; that one of them might be free, to help whoever was held escape. Light, I
cannot stand to be a prisoner again. Not again. Gingerly, she tried reaching for saidar again. The
pain was not so bad this time—merely as if someone had dropped a rock on her head—but it
shattered the emptiness before she could even think of a rose.
“One of them’s awake!” a man’s panicked voice shouted.
Egwene tried to hang limp and look unthreatening. How in the Light could I look threatening
tied up like a sack of meal! Burn me, I have to buy time. I have to! “I will not harm you,” she told
the sweaty-faced fellow who came running toward her. Or she tried to tell him. She was not sure how
much she had actually said before something crashed into her head again and darkness rolled over her
in a wave of nausea.
Waking was easier the next time. Her head still hurt, but not as much as it had, though her
thoughts did seem to spin dizzily. At least my stomach isn’t. . . . Light, I’d better not think of that.
There was a taste of sour wine and something bitter in her mouth. Strips of lamplight showed through
horizontal cracks in a crudely made wall, but she lay in darkness, on her back. On dirt, she thought.
The door did not seem to fit well either, but it looked all too sturdy.
She pushed herself to her hands and knees, and was surprised to find she was not tied in any
way. Except for that one wall of unpeeled logs, the others all seemed to be of rough stone. The light
through the cracks was enough to show her Nynaeve and Elayne lying sprawled on the dirt. There was
blood on the Daughter-Heir’s face. Neither of them moved except for the rise and fall of their chests
as they breathed. Egwene hesitated between trying to wake them immediately and seeing what lay on
the other side of that wall. Just a peek, she told herself. I might as well see what we have guarding
us before I wake them.
She told herself it was not because she was afraid she might be unable to waken them. As she
put her eye to one of the cracks near the door, she thought of the blood on Elayne’s face and tried to
remember exactly what it was Nynaeve had done for Dailin.
The next room was large—it had to be all the rest of the log building she had seen—and
windowless, but brightly lit with gold and silver lamps hanging from spikes driven into the walls and
the logs that made the high ceiling. There was no fireplace. On the packed dirt floor farmhouse tables
and chairs mingled with chests covered in gilt-work and inlaid with ivory. A carpet woven in
peacocks lay beside a huge canopied bed, piled deep with filthy blankets and comforters, with
elaborately carved and gilded posts.
A dozen men stood or sat around the room, but all eyes were on one large, fair-haired man who
might have been handsome if his face were cleaner. He stood staring down at the top of a table with
fluted legs and gilded scrollwork, one hand on his sword hilt, a finger of the other pushing something
she could not make out in small circles on the tabletop.
The outer door opened, revealing night outside, and a lanky man with his left ear gone came in.
“He has no come, yet,” he said roughly. He was missing two fingers on his left hand, too. “I do no
like dealing with that kind.”
The big, fair-haired man paid him no mind, only kept moving whatever it was on the table.

“Three Aes Sedai,” he murmured, then laughed. “Good prices for Aes Sedai, if you have the belly to
deal with the right buyer. If you’re ready to risk having your belly ripped out through your mouth
should you try selling him a pig in a sack. Not so safe as slitting the crew’s throats on a trader’s ship,
eh, Coke? Not so easy, wouldn’t you say?”
There was a nervous stir among the other men, and the one addressed, a stocky fellow with
shifty eyes, leaned forward anxiously. “They are Aes Sedai, Adden.” She recognized that voice; the
man who had made the coarse suggestions. “They must be, Adden. The rings prove it, I tell you!”
Adden picked up something from the table, a small circle that glinted gold in the lamplight.
Egwene gasped and felt at her fingers. They took my ring!
“I do no like it,” muttered the lanky man with the missing ear. “Aes Sedai. Any one of them
could kill us all. Fortune prick me! You do be a stone-carved fool, Coke, and I ought to carve your
throat. What if one of them do wake before he does come?”
“They’ll not wake for hours.” That was a fat man with a hoarse voice and a gap-toothed sneer.
“My granny taught me of that stuff we fed them. They’ll sleep till sunrise, and he’ll come long afore
then.”
Egwene worked her mouth around the sour wine taste and the bitterness. Whatever it was, your
granny lied to you. She should have strangled you in your cradle! Before this “he” came, this man
who thought he could buy Aes Sedai—like a bloody Seanchan!—she would have Nynaeve and
Elayne on their feet. She crawled to Nynaeve.
As near as she could tell, Nynaeve seemed to be sleeping, so she began with the simple
expedient of shaking her. To her surprise, Nynaeve’s eyes shot open.
“Wha—?”
She got a hand over Nynaeve’s mouth in time to stop the word. “We are being held prisoner,”
she whispered. “There are a dozen men on the other side of that wall, and more outside. A great many
more. They gave us something to make us sleep, but it wasn’t very successful. Do you remember,
yet?”
Nynaeve pulled Egwene’s hand aside. “I remember.” Her voice was soft and grim. She
grimaced and twisted her mouth, then suddenly barked a nearly silent laugh. “Sleepwell root. The
fools gave us sleepwell root mixed in wine. Wine near gone to vinegar, it tastes like. Quick, do you
remember anything of what I taught you? What does sleepwell root do?”
“It clears headaches so you can sleep,” Egwene said just as softly. And nearly as grimly, until
she heard what she was saying. “It makes you a little drowsy, but that is all.” The fat man had not
listened well to what his granny told him. “All they did was help clear the pain of being hit in the
head.”
“Exactly,” Nynaeve said. “And once we wake Elayne, we’ll give them a thanking they won’t
forget.” She rose, only to crouch beside the golden-haired woman.
“I think I saw more than a hundred of them outside when they brought us in,” Egwene whispered
to Nynaeve’s back. “I am sure you won’t mind if I use the Power as a weapon this time. And someone
is apparently coming to buy us. I mean to do something to that fellow that will make him walk in the
Light till the day he dies!” Nynaeve was still crouched over Elayne, but neither of them was moving.
“What is the matter?”
“She is hurt badly, Egwene. I think her skull is broken, and she is barely breathing. Egwene, she
is dying as surely as Dailin was.”
“Can’t you do something?” Egwene tried to remember all the flows Nynaeve had woven to Heal
the Aiel woman, but she could recall no more than every third thread. “You have to!”

“They took my herbs,” Nynaeve muttered fiercely, her voice trembling. “I can’t! Not without the
herbs!” Egwene was shocked to realize Nynaeve was on the point of tears. “Burn them all, I can’t do
it without—!” Suddenly she seized Elayne’s shoulders as if she meant to lift the unconscious woman
and shake her. “Burn you, girl,” she rasped, “I did not bring you all this way to die! I should have left
you scrubbing pots! I should have tied you up in a sack for Mat to carry to your mother! I will not let
you die on me! Do you hear me? I won’t allow it!” Saidar suddenly shone around her, and Elayne’s
eyes and mouth opened wide together.
Egwene got her hands over Elayne’s mouth just in time to muffle any sound, she thought, but as
she touched her, the eddies of Nynaeve’s Healing caught her like a straw on the edge of a whirl pool.
Cold froze her to the bone, meeting heat that seared outward as if it meant to crisp her flesh; the world
vanished in a sensation of rushing, falling, flying, spinning.
When it finally ended, she was breathing hard and staring down at Elayne, who stared back over
the hands she still had pressed over her woman’s mouth. The last of Egwene’s headache was gone.
Even the backwash of what Nynaeve had done had apparently been enough for that. The murmur of
voices from the other room was no louder; if Elayne had made any noise—or if she had—Adden and
the others had not noticed.
Nynaeve was on her hands and knees, head down and shaking. “Light!” she muttered. “Doing it
that way . . . was like peeling off . . . my own skin. Oh, Light!” She peered at Elayne. “How do you
feel, girl?” Egwene pulled her hands away.
“Tired,” Elayne murmured. “And hungry. Where are we? There were some men with slings. . . .”
Hastily Egwene told her what had happened. Elayne’s face began to darken a long way before
she was done.
“And now,” Nynaeve added in a voice like iron, “we are going to show these louts what it
means to meddle with us.” Saidar shone around her once more.
Elayne was unsteady getting to her feet, but the glow surrounded her, as well. Egwene reached
out to the True Source almost gleefully.
When they looked through the cracks again, to see exactly what they had to deal with, there were
three Myrddraal in the room.
Dead-black garb hanging unnaturally still, they stood by the table, and every man but Adden had
moved as far from them as he could, till they all had their backs against the walls and their eyes on the
dirt floor. Across the table from the Myrddraal, Adden faced those eyeless stares, but sweat made
runnels in the dirt on his face.
The Fade picked up a ring from the table. Egwene saw now that it was a much heavier circle of
gold than the Great Serpent rings.
Face pressed against the crack between two logs, Nynaeve gasped softly and fumbled at the neck
of her dress.
“Three Aes Sedai,” the Halfman hissed, its amusement sounding like dead things powdering to
dust, “and one carried this.” The ring made a heavy thud as the Myrddraal tossed it back on the table.
“They are the ones I seek,” another of them rasped. “You will be well rewarded, human.”
“We must take them by surprise,” Nynaeve said softly. “What kind of lock holds this door?”
Egwene could just see the lock on the outside of the door, an iron thing on a chain heavy enough
to hold an enraged bull. “Be ready,” she said.
She thinned one flow of Earth to finer than a hair, hoping the Halfmen could not sense so small a
channeling, and wove it into the iron chain, into the tiniest bits of it.
One of the Myrddraal lifted its head. Another leaned across the table toward Adden. “I itch,

human. Are you sure they sleep?” Adden swallowed hard and nodded his head.
The third Myrddraal turned to stare at the door to the room where Egwene and the others
crouched.
The chain fell to the floor, the Myrddraal staring at it snarled, and the outer door swung open,
black-veiled death flowing in from the night.
The room erupted in screams and shouts as men clawed for their swords to fight stabbing Aiel
spears. The Myrddraal drew blades blacker than their garb and fought for their lives, too. Egwene
had once seen six cats all fighting each other; this was that a hundredfold. And yet in seconds, silence
reigned. Or almost silence.
Every human not wearing a black veil lay dead with a spear through him; one pinned Adden to
the wall. Two Aiel lay still, as well, amid the jumble of overturned furniture and dead. The three
Myrddraal stood back-to-back in the center of the room, black swords in their hands. One was
clutching his side as if wounded, though he gave no other sign of it. Another had a long gash down its
pale face; it did not bleed. Around them circled the five veiled Aiel still alive, crouching. From
outside came screams and clashes of metal that said more Aiel still fought in the night, but in the room
was a softer sound.
As they circled, the Aiel drummed their spears against their small hide bucklers. Thrum-thrumTHRUM-thrum . . . thrum-thrum-THRUMthrum . . . thrum-thrum-THRUM-thrum.The Myrddraal
turned with them, and their eyeless faces seemed uncertain, uneasy that the fear their gaze struck into
every human heart did not seem to touch these.
“Dance with me, Shadowman,” one of the Aiel called suddenly, tauntingly. He sounded like a
young man.
“Dance with me, Eyeless.” That was a woman.
“Dance with me.”
“Dance with me.”
“I think,” Nynaeve said, straightening, “that it is time.” She threw open the door, and the three
women wrapped in the glow of saidar stepped out.
It seemed as though, for the Myrddraal, the Aiel had ceased to exist, and for the Aiel, the
Myrddraal. The Aiel stared at Egwene and the others above their veils as if not quite sure what they
were seeing; she heard one of the women gasp loudly. The Myrddraal’s eyeless stare was different.
Egwene could almost feel the Halfmen’s knowledge of their own deaths in it; Halfmen knew women
embracing the True Source when they saw them. She was sure she could feel a desire for her death,
too, if theirs could buy hers, and an even stronger desire to strip the soul out of her flesh and make
both playthings for the Shadow, a desire to. . . .
She had just stepped into the room, yet it seemed she had been meeting that stare for hours. “I’ll
take no more of this,” she growled, and unleashed a flow of Fire.
Flames burst out of all three Myrddraal, sprouting in every direction, and they shrieked like
splintered bones jamming a meat-grinder. Yet she had forgotten she was not alone, that Elayne and
Nynaeve were with her. Even as the flames consumed the Halfmen, the very air seemed suddenly to
push them together in midair, crushing them into a ball of fire and blackness that grew smaller and
smaller. Their screams dug at Egwene’s spine, and something shot out from Nynaeve’s hands—a thin
bar of white light that made noonday sun seem dark, a bar of fire that made molten metal seem cold,
connecting her hands to the Myrddraal. And they ceased to exist as if they had never been. Nynaeve
gave a startled jump, and the glow around her vanished.
“What . . . what was that?” Elayne asked.

Nynaeve shook her head; she looked as stunned as Elayne sounded. “I don’t know. I . . . I was so
angry, so afraid, at what they wanted to. . . . I do not know what it was.”
Balefire, Egwene thought. She did not know how she knew, but she was certain of it.
Reluctantly, she made herself release saidar; made it release her. She did not know which was
harder. And I did not see a thing of what she did!
The Aiel unveiled themselves, then. A trifle hastily, Egwene thought, as if to tell her and the
other two they were no longer ready to fight. Three of the Aiel were male, one an older man with
more than touches of gray in his dark red hair. They were tall, these Aielmen, and young or old, they
had that calm sureness in their eyes, that dangerous grace of motion Egwene associated with Warders;
death rode on their shoulders, and they knew it was there and were not afraid. One of the women was
Aviendha. The screams and shouts outside were dying away.
Nynaeve started toward the fallen Aiel.
“There is no need, Aes Sedai,” the older man said. “They took Shadowman steel.”
Nynaeve still bent to check each, pulling their veils away so she could peel back eyelids and
feel throats for a pulse. When she straightened from the second, her face was white. It was Dailin.
“Burn you! Burn you!” It was not clear whether she meant Dailin, or the man with gray in his hair, or
Aviendha, or all Aiel. “I did not Heal her so she could die like this!”
“Death comes to us all,” Aviendha began, but when Nynaeve rounded on her, she fell silent. The
Aiel exchanged glances, as if not certain whether Nynaeve might do to them what had been done to
the Myrddraal. It was not fear in their eyes, only awareness.
“Shadowman steel kills,” Aviendha said, “it does not wound.” The older man looked at her, a
slight surprise in his eyes—Egwene decided that, like Lan, for this man that flicker of the eyelids was
the equivalent of another man’s open astonishment—and Aviendha said, “They know little of some
things, Rhuarc.”
“I am sorry,” Elayne said in a clear voice, “that we interrupted your . . . dance. Perhaps we
should not have interfered.”
Egwene gave her a startled look, then saw what she was doing. Put them at ease, and give
Nynaeve a chance to cool down. “You were handling things quite well,” she said. “Perhaps we
offended by putting our noses in.”
The graying man—Rhuarc—gave a deep chuckle. “Aes Sedai, I for one am glad of . . . whatever
it was you did.” For a moment he looked not entirely sure of that, but in the next he had his good
temper back. He had a good smile, and a strong, square face; he was handsome, if a little old. “We
could have killed them, but three Shadowmen. . . . They would have killed two or three of us,
certainly, perhaps all, and I cannot say we would have finished them all. For the young, death is an
enemy they wish to try their strength against. For those of us a little older, she is an old friend, an old
lover, but one we are not eager to meet again soon.”
Nynaeve seemed to relax with his speech, as if meeting an Aiel who did not seem anxious to die
had leached the tension out of her. “I should thank you,” she said, “and I do. I will admit I am
surprised to see you, though. Aviendha, did you expect to find us here? How?”
“I followed you.” The Aiel woman seemed unembarrassed. “To see what you would do. I saw
the men take you, but I was too far back to help. I was sure you must see me if I came too close, so I
stayed a hundred paces behind. By the time I saw you could not help yourselves, it was too late to try
alone.”
“I am sure you did what you could,” Egwene said faintly. She was just a hundred paces behind
us? Light, the brigands never saw anything.

Aviendha took her words as urging to tell more. “I knew where Coram must be, and he knew
where Dhael and Luaine were, and they knew. . . .” She paused, frowning at the older man. “I did not
expect to find any clan chief, much less my own, among those who came. Who leads the Taardad
Aiel, Rhuarc, with you here?”
Rhuarc shrugged as if it were of no account. “The sept chiefs will take their turns, and try to
decide if they truly wish to go to Rhuidean when I die. I would not have come, except that Amys and
Bair and Melaine and Seana stalked me like ridgecats after a wild goat. The dreams said I must go.
They asked if I truly wanted to die old and fat in a bed.”
Aviendha laughed as if at a great joke. “I have heard it said that a man caught between his wife
and a Wise One often wishes for a dozen old enemies to fight instead. A man caught between a wife
and three Wise Ones, and the wife a Wise One herself, must consider trying to slay Sightblinder.”
“The thought came to me.” He frowned down at something on the floor; three Great Serpent
rings, Egwene saw, and a much heavier golden ring made for a man’s large finger. “It still does. All
things must change, but I would not be a part of that change if I could set myself aside from it. Three
Aes Sedai, traveling to Tear.” The other Aiel glanced at one another as if they did not want Egwene
and her companions to notice.
“You spoke of dreams,” Egwene said. “Do your Wise Ones know what their dreams mean?”
“Some do. If you would know more than that, you must speak to them. Perhaps they will tell an
Aes Sedai. They do not tell men, except what the dreams say we must do.” He sounded tired,
suddenly. “And that is usually what we would avoid, if we could.”
He stooped to pick up the man’s ring. On it, a crane flew above a lance and crown; Egwene
knew it now. She had seen it often before, dangling about Nynaeve’s neck on a leather cord. Nynaeve
stepped on the other rings to snatch it out of his hand; her face was flushed, with anger and too many
other emotions for Egwene to read. Rhuarc made no move to take it back, but went on in the same
weary tone.
“And one of them carries a ring I have heard of as a boy. The ring of Malkieri kings. They rode
with the Shienarans against the Aiel in my father’s time. They were good in the dance of the spears.
But Malkier fell to the Blight. It is said only a child king survived, and he courts the death that took
his land as other men court beautiful women. Truly, this is a strange thing, Aes Sedai. Of all the
strange sights I thought I might see when Melaine harried me out of my own hold and over the
Dragonwall, none has been so strange as this. The path you set me is one I never thought my feet
would follow.”
“I set no paths for you,” Nynaeve said sharply. “All I want is to continue my journey. These men
had horses. We will take three of them and be on our way.”
“In the night, Aes Sedai?” Rhuarc said. “Is your journey so urgent that you would travel these
dangerous lands in the dark?”
Nynaeve struggled visibly before saying, “No.” In a firmer tone she added, “But I mean to leave
with the sunrise.”
The Aiel carried the dead outside the palisade, but neither Egwene nor her companions wanted
to use the filthy bed Adden had slept in. They picked up their rings and slept under the sky in their
cloaks and the blankets the Aiel gave them.
When dawn pearled the sky to the east, the Aiel produced a breakfast of tough, dried meat—
Egwene hesitated over that until Aviendha told her it was goat—flatbread that was almost as difficult
to chew as the stringy meat, and a blue-veined white cheese that had a tart taste and was hard enough
to make Elayne murmur that the Aiel must practice by chewing rocks. But the Daughter-Heir ate as

much as Egwene and Nynaeve together. The Aiel turned the horses loose—they did not ride unless
they had to, Aviendha explained, sounding as if she herself would as soon run on blistered feet—after
choosing out the three best for Egwene and the others. They were all tall and nearly as big as
warhorses, with proud necks and fierce eyes. A black stallion for Nynaeve, a roan mare for Elayne,
and a gray mare for Egwene.
She chose to call the gray Mist, in the hope that a gentle name might soothe her, and indeed, Mist
did seem to step lightly as they rode south, just as the sun lifted a red rim above the horizon.
The Aiel accompanied them afoot, all those who had survived the fight. Three more had died
aside from the two the Myrddraal killed. They were nineteen, altogether, now. They loped along
easily alongside the horses. At first, Egwene tried holding Mist to a slow walk, but the Aiel thought
this very funny.
“I will race you ten miles,” Aviendha said, “and we shall see who wins, your horse or I.”
“I will race you twenty!” Rhuarc called, laughing.
Egwene thought they might actually be serious, and when she and the others let their horses walk
at a quicker pace, the Aiel certainly showed no sign of falling back.
When the thatched rooftops of Jurene came in sight, Rhuarc said, “Fare you well, Aes Sedai.
May you always find water and shade. Perhaps we will meet again before the change comes.” He
sounded grim. As the Aiel curved away to the south, Aviendha and Chiad and Bain each raised a hand
in farewell. They did not seem to be slowing down now that they no longer ran with the horses; if
anything, they ran a little faster. Egwene had a suspicion they meant to maintain that pace until they
reached wherever it was they were going.
“What did he mean by that?” she asked. “ ‘Perhaps we will meet again before the change’?”
Elayne shook her head.
“It does not matter what he meant,” Nynaeve said. “I am just as glad they came last night, but I
am glad to have them gone, too. I hope there is a ship here.”
Jurene itself was a small place, all wooden houses and none more than a single story, but the
White Lion banner of Andor flew over it on a tall staff, and fifty of the Queen’s Guards held it, in red
coats with long white collars beneath shining breastplates. They had been placed there, their captain
said, to make a safe haven for refugees who wished to flee to Andor, but fewer such came every day.
Most went to villages further downriver, now, nearer Aringill. It was a good thing the three women
had come when they did, as he expected to receive orders returning his company to Andor any day.
The few inhabitants of Jurene would likely go with them, leaving what remained for brigands and the
Cairhienin soldiers of warring Houses.
Elayne kept her face hidden in the hood of her sturdy wool cloak, but none of the soldiers
seemed to associate the girl with red-gold hair with their Daughter-Heir. Some asked her to stay;
Egwene was not sure whether Elayne was pleased or shocked. She herself told the men who asked
her that she had no time for them. It was nice, in an odd way, to be asked; she certainly had no wish to
kiss any of these fellows, but it was pleasant to be reminded that some men, at least, thought she was
as pretty as Elayne. Nynaeve slapped one man’s face. That almost made Egwene laugh, and Elayne
smiled openly; Egwene thought Nynaeve had been pinched, and despite the glare on her face, she did
not look entirely displeased, either.
They were not wearing their rings. It had not taken much effort on Nynaeve’s part to convince
them that one place they did not want to be taken for Aes Sedai was Tear, especially if the Black
Ajah was there. Egwene had hers in her pouch with the stone ter’angreal; she touched it often to
remind herself they were still there. Nynaeve wore hers on the cord that held Lan’s heavy ring

between her breasts.
There was a ship in Jurene, tied to the single stone dock sticking into the Erinin. Not the ship
Aviendha had seen, it seemed, but still a ship. Egwene was dismayed when she saw it. Twice as
wide as the Blue Crane, the Darter belied its name with a bluff bow as round as its captain.
That worthy fellow blinked at Nynaeve and scratched his ear when she asked if his vessel was
fast. “Fast? I am full of fancy wood from Shienar and rugs from Kandor. What need to be fast with a
cargo like that? Prices only go up. Yes, I suppose there are faster ships behind me, but they’ll not put
in here. I would not have stopped myself if I hadn’t found worms in the meat. Fool notion that they’d
have meat to sell in Cairhien. The Blue Crane? Aye, I saw Ellisor hung up on something upriver this
morning. He’ll not get off soon, I’m thinking. That’s what a fast ship brings you.”
Nynave paid their fares—and twice as much again for the horses—with such a look on her face
that neither Egwene nor Elayne spoke to her until long after the Darter had wallowed away from
Jurene.

CHAPTER
40

A Hero in the Night

Leaning on the rail, Mat watched the walled town of Aringill come closer as the sweeps
worked the Gray Gull in toward the long, tarred-timber docks. Protected by high stone wing-walls
that thrust out into the river, those docks swarmed with people, and more were leaving the ships of
various sizes that lay tied all along them. Some of the people pushed barrows, or pulled sledges or
tall-wheeled carts, all piled high with furniture and chests lashed in place, but most carried bundles
on their backs, if that. Not everyone bustled. Many men and women huddled together uncertainly, and
children clung crying to their legs. Soldiers in red coats and shiny breastplates kept trying to make
them move off the docks into the town, but most seemed too frightened to move.
Mat turned and shaded his eyes to peer at the river they were leaving. The Erinin was busier
here than he had seen it south of Tar Valon, with nearly a dozen vessels under way in sight, ranging
from a long, sharp-prowed splinter darting upriver against the current, pushed by two triangular sails,
to a wide, bluff-bowed ship with square sails, still wallowing along well to the north.
Nearly half the ships he could see had nothing to do with the river trade, though. Two broadbeamed craft with empty decks were lumbering across the river, toward a smaller town on the far
bank, while three others labored back toward Aringill, their decks packed with people like barrels of
fish. The setting sun, still its own height above the horizon, shadowed a banner flying over that other
town. That shore was Cairhien, but he did not need to see the banner to know it was the White Lion of
Andor. There had been talk enough in the few Andoran villages where the Gray Gull had stopped
briefly.
He shook his head. Politics did not interest him. As long as they don’t try telling me again I’m
an Andorman just because of some map. Burn me, they might even try to make me fight in their
bloody army, if this Cairhien business spreads. Following orders. Light! With a shiver, he turned
back to Aringill. Barefoot men on the Gray Gull were readying ropes to toss to others on the docks.
Captain Mallia was eyeing him from back by the tiller. The fellow had never given up his efforts
to ingratiate himself with them, his attempts to learn what their important mission was. Mat had
finally shown him the sealed letter and told him that he was carrying it from the Daughter-Heir to the
Queen. A personal message from a daughter to her mother; no more. Mallia had only seemed to hear
the words “Queen Morgase.”
Mat grinned to himself. A deep coat pocket held two purses fatter than when he had boarded the
vessel; he had enough loose coin to more than fill another two. His luck had not been quite so good as
on that first, strange night when the dice and everything else had seemed to go crazy, but still it was
good enough. After the third night, Mallia had given up trying to show his friendliness by gambling,
but his money chest was already lighter by then. It would be lighter still after Aringill. Mallia had
need to restock his food—Mat glanced at the people milling on the docks—if he could, here, at any

price.
The grin faded as his thoughts went back to the letter. A little work with a hot knife blade, and
the golden lily seal had been lifted. He had found nothing: Elayne was studying hard and making
progress and eager to learn. She was a dutiful daughter, and the Amyrlin Seat had punished her for
running away and told her never to speak of it again, so her mother would understand why she could
not say more. She said she had been raised to the Accepted, and was that not wonderful, so soon, and
she was being trusted with greater duties now, and would have to leave Tar Valon for just a short
time on the service of the Amyrlin herself. Her mother was not to worry.
It was all very well for her to tell Morgase not to worry. It was him she had landed in the soup
kettle. This silly letter had to be the reason those men had come after him, but even Thom had been
able to make nothing of it, though he muttered about “ciphers” and “codes” and “the Game of
Houses.”
Mat had the letter safe in the lining of his coat, now, its seal replaced, and he was willing to bet
no one would ever know. If someone wanted it badly enough to kill him for it, they might try again. I
told you I’d deliver it, Nynaeve, and I bloody will, no matter who tries to stop me. Even so, he
would have words to say the next time he saw those three irritating women—If I ever do. Light, I
never thought of that—words he did not think they would enjoy hearing.
As the crewmen hurled their lines onto the dock, Thom came on deck, his instrument cases on his
back and his bundle in one hand. Even with a limp he strutted to the rail, giving the tail of his cloak
little flourishes to make the colored patches flutter, and blowing out his long, white mustaches
importantly.
“Nobody is watching, Thom,” Mat said. “I don’t think they would even see a gleeman unless he
had food in his hands.”
Thom stared at the docks. “Light! I had heard it was bad, but I did not expect this! Poor fools.
Half of them look as if they are starving. It may cost us one of your purses for a room tonight. And the
other for a meal, if you intend to keep on the way you’ve been going. Nearly made me ill to watch
you. You try eating that way where those people down there can see you, and you may have your
brains battered out.”
Mat only smiled at him.
Mallia came stumping down the deck, tugging the point of his beard, as the Gray Gull was
warped into her berth. Crewmen ran to set a gangplank, and Sanor stood guard on it, heavy arms
folded across his chest, in case the throng on the docks tried to board. None of them did.
“So you will be leaving me here,” Mallia told Mat. The captain’s smile was not as ready as it
might have been. “Are you certain there is nothing I can do to help further? Burn my soul, I never saw
such a rabble! Those soldiers ought to clear the docks—with the sword, if need be!—so decent
traders can do business. Perhaps Sanor can make a path through this scum to your inn for you.”
So you’ll know where we are staying? Not bloody likely. “I had thought of eating before I went
ashore, and maybe a game of dice to pass the time.” Mallia’s face went white. “But I think I would
like a steady floor under me for my next meal. So we will leave you now, Captain. It has been an
enjoyable voyage.”
While relief still battled consternation on the captain’s face, Mat picked up his things from the
deck and, using the quarterstaff as a walking stick, made his way to the gangplank with Thom. Mallia
followed as far as the head of the plank, murmuring regrets at their departure that jumped from real to
insincere and back again. Mat was certain the man hated losing a chance to ingratiate himself with his
High Lord Samon by learning details of a pact between Andor and Tar Valon.

As Mat and the gleeman pushed through the crowds, Thom muttered, “I know the man is far from
likable, but why do you have to keep taunting him? Wasn’t it enough that you ate every scrap of what
he thought would feed him all the way to Tear?”
“I have not been eating it all for nearly two days.” The hunger had simply been gone one
morning, to his great relief. It had been as if Tar Valon had loosed its last hold on him. “I’ve been
throwing most of it over the side, and a hard job it was making sure nobody saw.” Among these
drawn faces, many of them children’s, it did not seem so funny anymore. “Mallia deserved taunting.
What about that ship, yesterday? The one that was stuck on a mudbank or something. He could have
stopped to help, but he would not go near it however much they shouted.” There was a woman with
long, dark hair ahead who might have been pretty if she had not looked so bone weary, peering into
the face of every man who passed her as if looking for someone; a boy little taller than her waist and
two girls shorter clung to her, all crying. “All that talk about river brigands and traps. It didn’t look
like any trap to me.”
Thom dodged around a high-wheeled cart—a cage holding two squealing pigs was lashed atop
the canvas-covered mound—and nearly tripped over a sledge being pulled, by a man and a woman.
“And you go out of your way to help people, do you? Strange how that has escaped my eye.”
“I’ll help anyone who can pay,” Mat said firmly. “Only fools in stories do something for
nothing.”
The two girls sobbed into their mother’s skirts while the boy fought his tears. The woman’s
deep-set eyes rested on Mat for a moment, studying his face, before drifting on; they looked as if she
wished she could weep, too. On impulse he dug a fistful of loose coins out of his pocket without
looking to see what they were and pressed them into her hand. She gave a start of surprise, stared at
the gold and silver in her hand with incomprehension that quickly turned to a smile, and opened her
mouth, tears of gratitude filling her eyes.
“Buy them something to eat,” he said quickly, and hurried on before she could speak. He noticed
Thom looking at him. “What are you gawking at? Coin comes easily as long as I can find somebody
who likes to dice.” Thom nodded slowly, but Mat was not sure he had gotten his point across. Bloody
children’s crying was getting on my nerves, that’s all. Fool gleeman will probably expect me to
give gold away to every waif that comes along, now. Fool! For an uncomfortable moment, he was
not certain whether the last had been meant for Thom or himself.
Taking himself in hand, he avoided looking at any face long enough to really see it until he found
the one he wanted, at the foot of the dock. The helmetless soldier in red coat and breastplate, urging
people into the town, had the grizzled look of a squadman, an experienced leader of ten or so.
Squinting into the setting sun, he reminded Mat of Uno, though he had both his eyes. He looked almost
as tired as the people he was chivying. “Move along,” he was shouting in a hoarse voice. “You can’t
bloody stay here. Move along. Into the town with you.”
Mat stationed himself squarely in front of the soldier and put on a smile. “Your pardon, Captain,
but can you tell me where I might find a decent inn? And a stable with good horses to sell. We have a
long way to go, come morning.”
The soldier eyed him up and down, examined Thom and his gleeman’s cloak, then shifted back
to Mat. “Captain, is it? Well, boy, you’ll have the Dark One’s own luck if you find a stable to sleep
in. Most of this lot are sleeping under hedges. And if you find a horse that hasn’t been slaughtered for
cooking, you’ll likely have to fight the man who owns it to make him sell.”
“Eating horse!” Thom muttered disgustedly. “Has it really become that bad on this side of the
river? Isn’t the Queen sending food?”

“It is bad, gleeman.” The soldier looked as if he wanted to spit. “They’re crossing over faster
than the mills can grind flour, or wagons carry foodstuffs from the farms. Well, it will not last much
longer. The order has come down. Tomorrow, we stop letting anyone across, and if they try, we send
them back.” He scowled at the people milling on the dock as if it were all their fault, then brought the
same hard look to bear on Mat. “You are taking up space, traveler. Move along.” His voice rose to a
shout again, directed at everyone within hearing. “Move along! You cannot bloody stay here! Move
along!”
Mat and Thom joined the thin stream of people, carts, and sledges flowing toward the gates in
the town wall, and into Aringill.
The main streets were paved with flat gray stones, but they were crowded with so many people
that it was difficult to see the stones under your own boots. Most appeared to be moving aimlessly,
with nowhere to go, and those who had given up squatted dejectedly along the sides of the street, the
lucky ones with bundled belongings in front of them or some cherished possession clutched in their
arms. Mat saw three men holding clocks, and a dozen or more with silver goblets or platters. The
women held children to their breasts, mainly. A babble filled the air, a low, wordless hum of worry.
He pushed through the crowd with a frown on his face, searching for the sign that would mark an inn.
The buildings were every sort, wood and brick and stone all cheek by jowl, with roofs of tile, or
slate, or thatch.
“It does not sound like Morgase,” Thom said after a time, half to himself. His bushy eyebrows
were pulled down like a white arrow pointing to his nose.
“What does not sound like her?” Mat asked absently.
“Stopping the crossings. Sending people back. She always had a temper like lightning, but she
always had a soft heart, too, for anyone poor or hungry.” He shook his head.
Mat saw a sign, then—The Riverman, it said, and showed a barefoot, shirtless fellow doing a jig
—and turned that way, forcing an angle across the flow with the quarterstaff. “Well, it had to be her.
Who else could it be? Forget Morgase, Thom. We’ve a long way to Caemlyn, yet. First let us see how
much gold it takes to buy a bed for the night.”
The common room of The Riverman looked as crowded as the street outside, and when the
innkeeper heard what Mat wanted, he laughed till his chins shook. “I am sleeping four to a bed, now.
If my own mother came to me, I could not give her a blanket by the fire.”
“As you must have noticed,” Thom said, his voice taking on that echoing quality, “I am a
gleeman. Surely you can find at least pallets in a corner in return for me entertaining your patrons with
stories and juggling, eating of fire, and sleight of hand.” The innkeeper laughed in his face.
As Mat pulled him back into the street, Thom growled in his normal voice, “You never gave me
a chance to ask after his stable. Surely I could have gotten us a place in the hayloft, at least.”
“I have slept in enough stables and barns since leaving Emond’s Field,” Mat told him, “and
under enough bushes, too. I want a bed.”
But at the next four inns he found, the innkeeper gave him the same answer as the first; the last
two almost threw him out bodily when he offered to dice for a bed. And when the owner of the fifth
told him he could not give a pallet to the Queen herself—this at a place called The Good Queen—he
sighed and asked, “What about your stable, then? Surely we can bed down in the hayloft for a price.”
“My stable is for horses,” the round-faced man said, “not that many are left in the city.” He had
been polishing a silver cup; now he opened one door of a shallow cupboard standing on top of a
deep, drawered chest and placed it inside with others; none of them matched. A tooled-leather dice
cup sat atop the chest, just beyond the arc of the cupboard’s doors. “I do not put people in there to

frighten the horses, and perhaps make off with them. Those who pay me for stabling their animals
want them well tended, and I’ve two of my own in there, besides. There are no beds in my stable for
you.”
Mat eyed the dice cup thoughtfully. He pulled a gold Andoran crown out of his pocket and set it
atop the chest. The next coin was a silver Tar Valon mark, then a gold one, and a gold Tairen crown.
The innkeeper looked at the coins and licked his plump lips. Mat added two silver Illianer marks and
another gold Andoran crown, and looked at the round-faced man. The innkeeper hesitated. Mat
reached for the coins. The innkeeper’s hand reached them first.
“Perhaps just the two of you would not disturb the horses too greatly.”
Mat smiled at him. “Speaking of horses, what price for those two of yours? With saddles and
bridles, of course.”
“I will not sell my horses,” the man said, clutching the coins to his chest.
Mat picked up the dice cup and rattled it. “Twice as much again against the horses, saddles, and
bridles.” He shook his coat pocket to make the loose coins rattle, too, to show he had more to cover
the wager. “My one toss against the best of your two.” He almost laughed as greed lit the innkeeper’s
entire face.
When Mat walked into the stable, the first thing he did was check along the half-dozen stalls
with horses in them for a pair of brown geldings. They were nondescript animals, but they were his.
They needed currying badly, but otherwise they seemed in good condition, especially considering that
all the stablemen but one had run off. The innkeeper had been extremely disparaging of their
complaints that they could no longer live on what he paid them, and he seemed to think it a crime that
the one man who remained had actually had the audacity to say he was going home to bed just because
he was tired from doing three men’s work.
“Five sixes,” Thom muttered behind him. The looks he cast around the stable did not seem as
enthralled as they might, seeing that he had suggested it in the first place. Dust motes shone in the last
light of the setting sun coming through the big doors, and the ropes used to hoist hay bales hung like
vines from pulleys in the roof beams. The hayloft was dim in the gloom above. “When he threw four
sixes and a five on his second toss, he thought you’d lost for sure, and so did I. You have not been
winning every toss of late.”
“I win enough.” Mat was just as relieved not to be winning every throw. Luck was one thing, but
remembering that night still sent shivers down his back. Still, for one moment as he shook that dice
cup, he had all but known what the pips would be. As he tossed the quarterstaff up into the loft,
thunder crashed in the sky. He scrambled up the ladder, calling back to Thom. “This was a good idea.
I’d think you would be happy to be in out of the rain tonight.”
Most of the hay was in bales stacked against the outer walls, but there was more than enough
loose for him to make a bed with his cloak over it. Thom appeared at the top of the ladder as he was
pulling two loaves of bread and a wedge of green-veined cheese from his leather scrip. The
innkeeper—his name was Jeral Florry—had parted with the food for merely enough coin to have
bought one of those horses in more peaceful days. They ate while rain began drumming on the roof,
washing the food down with water from their waterbottles—Florry had had no wine at any price—
and when they were done, Thom dug out his tinderbox and thumbed his long-stemmed pipe full of
tabac and settled back for a smoke.
Mat was lying on his back, staring at the shadowed roof and wondering if the rain would break
before morning—he wanted that letter out of his hands as quickly as possible—when he heard an axle
creak into the stable. Rolling to the edge of the loft, he peered down. There was enough dusk left for

him to see.
A slender woman was straightening from the shafts of the high-wheeled cart she had just dragged
in out of the rain, pulling off her cloak and muttering to herself as she shook the wet from it. Her hair
was plaited in a multitude of small braids, and her silk dress—he thought it was a pale green—was
elaborately embroidered across her breasts. The dress had been fine, once, but now it was tattered
and stained. She knuckled her back, still talking to herself in a low voice, and hurried to the stable
doors to peer out into the rain. Just as hurriedly, she ducked out to pull the big doors shut, enclosing
the stable in darkness. There was a rustling below, a clink and a slosh, and suddenly a small flare of
light bloomed into a lantern in her hands. She looked around, found a hook on a stall post, hung the
lantern, and went to dig under the roped canvas covering her cart.
“She did that quickly,” Thom said softly around his pipe. “She could have set fire to the stable
striking flint and steel in the dark like that.”
The woman came out with the end of a loaf of bread, which she gnawed as if it were hard and
her hunger did not care.
“Is there any of that cheese left?” Mat whispered. Thom shook his head.
The woman began sniffing at the air, and Mat realized she probably smelled Thom’s tabac
smoke. He was about to stand and announce their presence when one of the stable doors opened
again.
The woman crouched, ready to run, as four men walked in out of the rain, doffing their wet
cloaks to reveal pale coats with wide sleeves and embroidery across the chest, and baggy breeches
embroidered down the legs. Their clothes might be fancy, but they were all big men, and their faces
were grim.
“So, Aludra,” a man in a yellow coat said, “you did not run so fast as you thought to, eh?” He
had a strange accent, to Mat’s ear.
“Tammuz,” the woman said as if it were a curse. “It is not enough that you cause me to be cast
out of the Guild with your blundering, you great ox-brain you, but now you chase after me as well.”
She had the same odd way of speaking as the man. “Do you think that I am glad to see you?”
The one called Tammuz laughed. “You are a very large fool, Aludra, which I always knew. Had
you merely gone away, you could have lived a long life in some quiet place. But you could not forget
the secrets in your head, eh? Did you believe we would not hear that you try to earn your way making
what it is the right of the Guild alone to make?” Suddenly there was a knife in his hand. “It will be a
great pleasure to cut your throat, Aludra.”
Mat was not even aware that he had stood up until one of the doubled ropes dangling from the
ceiling was in his hands and he had launched himself out of the loft. Burn me for a bloody fool!
He only had time for that one frantic thought, and then he was plowing through the cloaked men,
sending them toppling like pins in a game of bowls. The ropes slipped through his hands, and he fell,
tumbling across the straw-covered floor himself, coins spilling from his pockets, to end up against a
stall. When he scrambled to his feet, the four men were already rising, too. And they all had knives in
their hands, now. Light-blind fool! Burn me! Burn me!
“Mat!”
He looked up, and Thom tossed his quarterstaff down to him. He snagged it out of the air just in
time to knock the blade out of Tammuz’s fist and thump him a sharp crack on the side of the head. The
man crumpled, but the other three were right behind, and for a hectic moment Mat had all he could do
with a whirling staff to keep knife blades away from him, rapping knees and ankles and ribs until he
could land a good blow on a head. When the last man fell, he stared at them a moment, then raised his

glare to the woman. “Did you have to choose this stable to be murdered in?”
She slipped a slim-bladed dagger back into a sheath at her belt. “I would have helped you, but I
feared that you might mistake me for one of these great buffoons if I came near with steel in my hand.
And I chose this stable because the rain is wet and so am I, and no one was watching this place.”
She was older than he had thought, at least ten or fifteen years older than he, but pretty still, with
large, dark eyes and a small, full mouth that seemed on the point of a pout. Or getting ready for a
kiss. He gave a small laugh and leaned on his staff. “Well, what is done is done. I suppose you were
not trying to bring us trouble.”
Thom was climbing down from the loft, awkwardly because of his leg, and Aludra looked from
him to Mat. The gleeman had put his cloak back on; he seldom let anyone see him without it,
especially for the first time. “This is like a story,” she said. “I am rescued by a gleeman and a young
hero”—she frowned at the men sprawled on the stable floor—“from these whose mothers were
pigs!”
“Why did they want to kill you?” Mat asked. “He said something about secrets.”
“The secrets,” Thom said in very nearly his performing voice, “of making fireworks, unless I
miss my guess. You are an Illuminator, are you not?” He made a courtly bow with an elaborate swirl
of his cloak. “I am Thom Merrilin, a gleeman, as you have seen.” Almost as an afterthought, he added,
“And this is Mat, a young man with a knack for finding trouble.”
“I was an Illuminator,” Aludra said stiffly, “but this great pig Tammuz, he ruined a performance
for the King of Cairhien, and nearly he destroyed the chapter house, too. But me, I was Mistress of the
Chapter House, so it was me that the Guild held responsible.” Her voice became defensive. “I do not
tell the secrets of the Guild, no matter what that Tammuz says, but I will not let myself starve while I
can make fireworks. I am no more in the Guild, so the laws of the Guild, they do not apply to me
now.”
“Galldrian,” Thom said, sounding almost as wooden as she had. “Well, he is a dead king now,
and he’ll see no more fireworks.”
“The Guild,” she said, sounding tired, “they all but blame me for this war in Cairhien, as if that
one night of disaster, it made Galldrian die.” Thom grimaced. “It seems I can no longer remain here,”
she went on. “Tammuz and these other oxen, they will wake soon. Perhaps this time they will tell the
soldiers that I stole what I have made.” She eyed Thom and then Mat, frowning in thought, and
seemed to reach a decision. “I must reward you, but I have no money. However, I have something that
is perhaps as good as gold. Maybe better. We shall see what you think.”
Mat exchanged glances with Thom as she went to root under the canvas covering her cart. I’ll
help anyone who can pay. He thought a speculative light had appeared in Thom’s blue eyes.
Aludra separated one bundle from a number like it, a short roll of heavy, oiled cloth almost as
fat as her arms would go around. Setting it down on the straw, she undid the binding cords and
unrolled the cloth across the floor. Four rows of pockets ran along the length of it, the pockets in each
row larger than those in the one before. Each pocket held a wax-coated cylinder of paper just large
enough for its end, trailing a dark cord, to stick out.
“Fireworks,” Thom said. “I knew it. Aludra, you must not do this. You can sell those for enough
to live ten days or more at a good inn, and eat well every day. Well, anywhere but here in Aringill.”
Kneeling beside the long strip of oiled cloth, she sniffed at him. “Be quiet, you old one you.” She
made it sound not unkindly. “I am not allowed to show gratitude? You think I would give you this if I
had no more for selling? Attend me closely.”
Mat squatted beside her, fascinated. He had seen fireworks twice in his life. Peddlers had

brought them to Emond’s Field, at great expense to the Village Council. When he was ten, he had tried
to cut one open to see what was inside, and had caused an uproar. Bran al’Vere, the Mayor, had
cuffed him; Doral Barran, who had been the Wisdom then, had switched him; and his father had
strapped him when he got home. Nobody in the village would talk to him for a month, except for Rand
and Perrin, and they mostly told him what a fool he had been. He reached out to touch one of the
cylinders. Aludra slapped his hand away.
“Attend me first, I say! These smallest, they will make a loud bang, but no more.” They were the
size of his little finger. “These next, they make a bang and a bright light. The next, they make the bang,
and the light, and many sparkles. The last”—these were fatter than his thumb—“make all of those
things, but the sparkles, they are many colors. Almost like a night-flower, but not up in the sky.”
Nightflower? Mat thought.
“You must be especially careful of these. You see, the fuse, it is very long.” She saw his blank
look, and waggled one of the long, dark cords at him. “This, this!”
“Where you put the fire,” he muttered. “I know that.” Thom made a sound in his throat and
stroked his mustaches with a knuckle as if covering a smile.
Aludra grunted. “Where you put the fire. Yes. Do not stay close to any of them, but these largest,
you run away from when you light the fuse. You comprehend me?” She briskly rolled up the long
cloth. “You may sell these if you wish, or use them. Remember, you must never put this close to fire.
Fire will make them all explode. So many as this at once, it could destroy a house, maybe.” She
hesitated over retying the cords, then added, “And there is one last thing, which you may have heard.
Do not cut open any of these, as some great fools do to see what is inside. Sometimes when what is
inside touches air, it will explode without the need of fire. You can lose fingers, or even a hand.”
“I’ve heard that,” Mat said dryly.
She frowned at him as if wondering whether he meant to do it anyway, then finally pushed the
rolled bundle toward him. “Here. I must go now, before these sons of goats awaken.” Glancing at the
still open door, and the rain falling in the night beyond, she sighed. “Perhaps I will find somewhere
else dry. I think I will go toward Lugard, tomorrow. These pigs, they will expect me to go to
Caemlyn, yes?”
It was even further to Lugard than to Caemlyn, and Mat suddenly remembered that hard end of
bread. And she had said she had no money. The fireworks would buy no meals until she found
someone who could afford them. She had never even looked at the gold and silver that had spilled
from his pockets when he fell; it glittered and sparkled among the straw in the lantern light. Ah, Light,
I cannot let her go hungry, I suppose. He scooped up as much as he could reach quickly.
“Uh . . . Aludra? I have plenty, you can see. I thought perhaps. . . .” He held out the coins toward
her. “I can always win more.”
She paused with her cloak half around her shoulders, then smiled at Thom as she swept it the
rest of the way on. “He is young yet, eh?”
“He is young,” Thom agreed. “And not half so bad as he would like to think himself. Sometimes
he is not.”
Mat glowered at both of them and lowered his hand.
Lifting the shafts of her cart, Aludra got it turned around and started for the door, giving Tammuz
a kick in the ribs as she passed. He groaned groggily.
“I would like to know something, Aludra,” Thom said. “How did you light that lantern so
quickly in the dark?”
Stopping short of the door, she smiled over her shoulder at him. “You wish me to tell you all of

my secrets? I am grateful, but I am not in love. That secret, not even the Guild knows, for it is my
discovery alone. I will tell you this much. When I know how to make it work properly, and work only
when I want it to, sticks will make my fortune for me.” Throwing her weight against the shafts, she
pulled the cart into the rain, and the night swallowed her.
“Sticks?” Mat said. He wondered if she might not be a little strange in the head.
Tammuz groaned again.
“Best we do the same as she, boy,” Thom said. “Else it’s a choice between slitting four throats
and maybe spending the next few days explaining ourselves to the Queen’s Guards. These look the
sort who’d set them on us out of spite. And they have enough to be spiteful for, I suppose.” One of
Tammuz’s companions twitched as if coming to, and muttered something incomprehensible.
By the time they had gathered everything and saddled the horses, Tammuz was up on his hands
and knees with his head hanging, and the others were stirring and groaning, too.
Swinging into his saddle, Mat stared at the rain outside the open door, falling harder than ever.
“A bloody hero,” he said. “Thom, if I ever look like acting the hero again, you kick me.”
“And what would you have done differently?”
Mat scowled at him, then pulled up his hood and spread the tail of his cloak over the fat roll tied
behind the high cantle of his saddle. Even with oiled cloth, a little more protection from the rain could
not hurt. “Just kick me!” He booted his horse in the ribs and galloped into the rainy night.

CHAPTER
41

A Hunter’s Oath

As the Snow Goose moved toward the long stone docks of Illian, sails furled and propelled by
its sweeps, Perrin stood near the stern watching great numbers of long-legged birds wading in the tall
marsh grass that all but encircled the great harbor. He recognized the small white cranes, and could
guess at their much larger blue brothers, but many of the crested birds—red-feathered or rosy, some
with flat bills broader than a duck’s—he did not know at all. A dozen sorts of gulls swooped and
soared above the harbor itself, and a black bird with a long, sharp beak skimmed just above the
water, its underbeak cutting a furrow. Ships three and four times as long as the Snow Goose lay
anchored across the expanse of the harbor, waiting their turns at the docks, or for the tides to shift so
they could sail beyond the long breakwater. Small fishing boats worked close to the marsh, and in the
creeks winding through it, two or three men in each dragging nets on long poles swung out from either
side of the boat.
The wind carried a sharp scent of salt, and did little to break the heat. The sun stood well over
halfway down to the horizon, but it seemed like noon. The air felt damp; it was the only way he could
think of it. Damp. His nose caught the smell of fresh fish from the boats, of old fish and mud from the
marsh, and the sour stink of a large tanning yard that lay on a treeless island in the marsh grass.
Captain Adarra muttered something softly behind him, the tiller creaked, and the Snow Goose
changed its course a trifle. Barefoot men at the sweeps moved as if not wanting to make a sound.
Perrin did not glance at them beyond a flicker of his eye.
He peered at the tannery, instead, watching men scrape hides stretched on rows of wooden
frames, and other men lift hides out of huge, sunken vats with long sticks. Sometimes they stacked the
hides on barrows, wheeling them into the long, low building at the edge of the yard; sometimes the
hides went back into the vats, with an addition of liquids poured from large stone crocks. They
probably made more leather in a day than was made in Emond’s Field in months, and he could see
another tannery on another island beyond the first.
It was not that he had any real interest in ships or fishing boats or tanning yards, or even very
much in the birds—though he did wonder what those pale red ones could be fishing for with their flat
bills, and some of them looked good to eat unless he watched himself—but anything at all was better
than watching the scene behind him on the deck of the Snow Goose. The axe at his belt was no
defense against that. A stone wall wouldn’t be defense enough, he thought.
Moiraine had been neither pleased nor displeased to discover that Zarine—I’ll not call her
Faile, whatever she wants to name herself! She is no falcon!—knew she was Aes Sedai, though she
had been perhaps a little upset with him for not telling her. A little upset. She called me a fool, but
that was all. Then. Moiraine did not seem to care one way or another about Zarine being a Hunter of
the Horn. But once she learned the girl thought they would lead her to the Horn of Valere, once she

learned he had known that, too, and not told her—Zarine had been more than forthcoming about both
subjects with Moiraine, to his mind—then her cold dark stare had taken on a quality that made him
feel as if he had been packed in a barrel of snow in the dead of winter. The Aes Sedai said nothing,
but she stared too often and too hard for any comfort.
He looked over his shoulder and quickly returned to studying the shoreline. Zarine was sitting
cross-legged on the deck near the horses tethered between the masts, her bundle and dark cloak
beside her, her narrow, divided skirts neatly arrayed, pretending to study the rooftops and towers of
the oncoming city. Moiraine was studying Illian, too, from just ahead of the men working the sweeps,
but now and then she shot a hard look at the girl from under the deep hood of her fine gray wool
cloak. How can she stand wearing that? His own coat was unbuttoned and his shirt unlaced at the
neck.
Zarine met each Aes Sedai look with a smile, but every time Moiraine turned away, she
swallowed and wiped her forehead.
Perrin rather admired her for managing that smile when Moiraine was watching. It was a good
deal more than he could do. He had never seen the Aes Sedai truly lose her temper, but he himself
was at the point of wishing she would shout, or rage, or anything but stare at him. Light, maybe not
anything! Maybe the stare was bearable.
Lan sat further toward the bow than Moiraine—his color-shifting cloak was still in the
saddlebags at his feet—outwardly absorbed in examining his sword blade, but making little effort to
hide his amusement. Sometimes his lips appeared to quirk very close to a smile. Perrin was not
certain; at times he thought it was only a shadow. Shadows could make a hammer seem to smile. Each
woman obviously thought she was the object of that amusement, but the Warder did not appear to
mind the tight-lipped frowns he received from both of them.
A few days earlier Perrin had heard Moiraine ask Lan, in a voice like ice, whether he saw
something to laugh at. “I would never laugh at you, Moiraine Sedai,” he had replied calmly, “but if
you truly intend to send me to Myrelle, I must become used to smiling. I hear that Myrelle tells her
Warders jokes. Gaidin must smile at their bond holder’s quips; you have often given me quips to
laugh at, have you not? Perhaps you would rather I stay with you after all.” She had given him a look
that would have nailed any other man to the mast, but the Warder never blinked. Lan made cold steel
seem like tin.
The crew had taken to padding about their work in utter silence when Moiraine and Zarine were
on deck together. Captain Adarra held his head tilted, and looked as if he were listening for
something he did not want to hear. He passed his orders in whispers, instead of the shouts he had used
at first. Everyone knew Moiraine was Aes Sedai, now, and everyone knew she was displeased.
Perrin had let himself get into one shouting match with Zarine, and he was not sure which of them had
said the words “Aes Sedai,” but the whole crew knew. Bloody woman! He was uncertain whether he
meant Moiraine or Zarine. If she is the falcon, what is the hawk supposed to be? Am I going to be
stuck with two women like her? Light! No! She is not a falcon, and that is an end to it! The only
good thing he could find in all this was that with an angry Aes Sedai to worry about, none of the crew
looked twice at his eyes.
Loial was nowhere in sight, at the moment. The Ogier stayed in his stifling cabin whenever
Moiraine and Zarine were topside together—working on his notes, he said. He only came on deck at
night, to smoke his pipe. Perrin did not see how he could take the heat; even Moiraine and Zarine
were better than being belowdecks.
He sighed and kept his eyes on Illian. The city the ship was approaching was large—as big as

Cairhien or Caemlyn, the only two great cities he had ever seen—and it reared out of a huge marsh
that stretched for miles like a plain of waving grass. Illian had no walls at all, but it seemed to be all
towers and palaces. The buildings were all pale stone, except for some that appeared covered with
white plaster, but the stone was white and gray and reddish and even faint shades of green. Rooftops
of tile sparkled under the sun with a hundred different hues. The long docks held many ships, most
dwarfing the Snow Goose, and bustled with the loading and unloading of cargo. There were shipyards
at the far end of the city, where great ships stood in every stage from skeletons of thick wooden ribs
to nearly ready to slide into the harbor.
Perhaps Illian was large enough to keep wolves at bay. They surely would not hunt in those
marshes. The Snow Goose had outrun the wolves that had followed him from the mountains. He
reached out for them gingerly, now, and felt—nothing. A curiously empty feeling, given that it was
what he wanted. His dreams had been his own—for the most part—since that first night. Moiraine
had asked about them in a cold voice, and he had told the truth. Twice he had found himself in that
odd sort of wolf dream, and both times Hopper had appeared, chasing him away, telling him he was
too young yet, too new. What Moiraine made of that, he had no idea; she told him nothing, except to
say he had best be wary.
“That’s as well by me,” he growled. He was almost becoming used to Hopper being dead but
not dead, in the wolf dreams, at least. Behind him, he heard Captain Adarra scuff his boots on the
deck and mutter something, startled that anyone would speak aloud.
Lines were hurled ashore from the ship. While they were still being made fast to stone posts
along the docks, the slightly built captain leaped into motion, whispering fiercely to his crew. He had
booms rigged to lift the horses onto the wharf almost as quickly as the gangplank was laid in place.
Lan’s black war horse kicked and nearly broke the boom hoisting him. Loial’s huge, hairy-fetlocked
mount needed two.
“An honor,” Adarra whispered to Moiraine with a bow as she stepped onto the wide plank
leading to the dock. “An honor to have served you, Aes Sedai.” She strode ashore without looking at
him, her face hidden in her deep hood.
Loial did not appear until everyone else was on the dock, and the horses, too. The Ogier came
thumping up the gangplank trying to don his long coat while carrying his big saddlebags and striped
blanketroll, and his cloak over one arm. “I did not know we had arrived,” he rumbled breathlessly. “I
was rereading my. . . .” He trailed off with a glance at Moiraine. She appeared to be absorbed in
watching Lan saddle Aldieb, but the Ogier’s ears flickered like a nervous cat’s.
His notes, Perrin thought. One of these days I have to see what he is saying about all this.
Something tickled the back of his neck, and he jumped a foot before he realized he was smelling a
clean, herbal scent through the spices and tar and stinks of the docks.
Zarine wiggled her fingers, smiling at them. “If I can do that with just a brush of my fingers,
farmboy, I wonder how high you would jump if I—?”
He was growing a little tired of considering looks from those dark, tilted eyes. She may be
pretty, but she looks at me the way I’d look at a tool I’d never seen before, trying to puzzle out
how it was made, and what it is supposed to be used for.
“Zarine.” Moiraine’s voice was cool but unruffled.
“I am called Faile,” Zarine said firmly, and for a moment, with her bold nose, she did look like a
falcon.
“Zarine,” Moiraine said firmly, “it is time for our ways to part. You will find better Hunting
elsewhere, and safer.”

“I think not,” Zarine said just as firmly. “A Hunter must follow the trail she sees, and no Hunter
would ignore the trail you four leave. And I am Faile.” She spoiled it a bit by swallowing, but she did
not blink as she met Moiraine’s eyes.
“Are you certain?” Moiraine said softly. “Are you sure you will not change your mind . . .
Falcon?”
“I will not. There is nothing you or your stone-faced Warder can do to stop me.” Zarine
hesitated, then added slowly, as if she had decided to be entirely truthful, “At least, there is nothing
that you will do that can stop me. I know a little of Aes Sedai; I know, for all the stories, that there are
things you will not do. And I do not believe stone-face would do what he must to make me give
over.”
“Are you sure enough of that to risk it?” Lan spoke quietly, and his face did not change, but
Zarine swallowed again.
“There is no need to threaten her, Lan,” Perrin said. He was surprised to realize he was glaring
at the Warder.
Moiraine’s glance silenced him and the Warder both. “You believe you know what an Aes Sedai
will not do, do you?” she said more softly than before. Her smile was not pleasant. “If you wish to go
with us, this is what you must do.” Lan’s eyelids flickered in surprise; the two women stared at each
other like falcon and mouse, but Zarine was not the falcon, now. “You will swear by your Hunter’s
oath to do as I say, to heed me, and not to leave us. Once you know more than you should of what we
do, I will not allow you to fall into the wrong hands. Know that for truth, girl. You will swear to act
as one of us, and do nothing that will endanger our purpose. You will ask no questions of where we
go or why: you will be satisfied with what I choose to tell you. All of this you will swear, or you will
remain here in Illian. And you will not leave this marsh until I return to release you, if it takes the rest
of your life. That I swear.”
Zarine turned her head uneasily, watching Moiraine out of one eye. “I may accompany you if I
swear?” The Aes Sedai nodded. “I will be one of you, the same as Loial or stone-face. But I can ask
no questions. Are they allowed to ask questions?” Moiraine’s face lost a little of its patience. Zarine
stood up straighter and held her head high. “Very well, then. I swear, by the oath I took as a Hunter. If
I break one, I will have broken both. I swear it!”
“Done,” Moiraine said, touching the younger woman’s forehead; Zarine shivered. “Since you
brought her to us, Perrin, she is your responsibility.”
“Mine!” he yelped.
“I am no one’s responsibility but my own!” Zarine nearly shouted.
The Aes Sedai went serenely on as if they had never opened their mouths. “It seems you have
found Min’s falcon, ta’veren. I have tried to discourage her, but it appears she will perch on your
shoulder whatever I do. The Pattern weaves a future for you, it seems. Yet remember this. If I must, I
will snip your thread from the Pattern. And if the girl endangers what must be, you will share her
fate.”
“I did not ask for her to come along!” Perrin protested. Moiraine calmly mounted Aldieb,
adjusting her cloak over the white mare’s saddle. “I did not ask for her!” Loial shrugged at him and
silently mouthed something. No doubt a saying about the dangers of angering Aes Sedai.
“You are ta’veren?” Zarine said disbelievingly. Her gaze ran over his sturdy country clothes
and settled on his yellow eyes. “Well, perhaps. Whatever you are, she threatens you as easily as she
does me. Who is Min? What does she mean, I will perch on your shoulder?” Her face tightened. “If
you try making me your responsibility, I will carve your ears. Do you hear me?”

Grimacing, he slipped his unstrung bow under the saddle girths along Stepper’s flank, and
climbed into the saddle. Restive after days on the ship, the dun lived up to his name until Perrin
calmed him with a firm hand on the reins and pats to his neck.
“None of that deserves an answer,” he growled. Min bloody told her! Burn you, Min! Burn you,
too, Moiraine! And Zarine! He could never remember Rand or Mat being bullied by women on every
side. Or himself, before leaving Emond’s Field. Nynaeve had been the only one. And Mistress
Luhhan, of course; she ran him and Master Luhhan both, everywhere but in the smithy. And Egwene
had had a way about her, though mostly with Rand. Mistress al’Vere, Egwene’s mother, always had a
smile, but things seemed to end up being done as she wanted, too. And the Women’s Circle had
looked over everybody’s shoulder.
Grumbling to himself, he reached down and took Zarine by an arm; she gave a squawk and
nearly dropped her bundle as he hoisted her up behind his saddle. Those divided skirts of hers made
it easy for her to straddle Stepper. “Moiraine will have to buy you a horse,” he muttered. “You cannot
walk the whole way.”
“You are strong, blacksmith,” Zarine said, rubbing her arm, “but I am not a piece of iron.” She
shifted around, stuffing her bundle and her cloak between them. “I can buy my own horse, if I need
one. The whole way where?”
Lan was already riding off the dock into the city, with Moiraine and Loial behind him. The Ogier
looked back at Perrin.
“No questions, remember? And my name is Perrin, Zarine. Not ‘big man,’ or ‘blacksmith,’ or
anything else. Perrin. Perrin Aybara.”
“And mine is Faile, shaggy-hair.”
With something close to a snarl, he booted Stepper after the others. Zarine had to throw her arms
around his waist to keep from being tossed over the dun’s crupper. He thought she was laughing.

CHAPTER
42

Easing the Badger

The hubbub of the city quickly submerged Zarine’s laughter—if that was what it was—beneath

all the clamor that Perrin remembered from Caemlyn and Cairhien. The sounds were different here,
slower, and pitched differently, but they were the same, too. Boots and wheels and hooves on rough,
uneven paving stones, cart and wagon axles squealing, music and song and laughter drifting from inns
and taverns. Voices. A hum of voices like putting his head into a giant beehive. A great city, living.
From down a side street he heard the clang of hammer on anvil, and shifted his shoulders
unconsciously. He missed the hammer and tongs in his hands, the white-hot metal giving off sparks as
his blows shaped it. The smithy sounds faded behind, buried under the rumble of carts and wagons,
and the babble of shopkeepers and people in the streets. Under all the smells of people and horses,
cooking and baking, and a hundred scents he had found peculiar to cities lay the smell of marsh and
salt water.
He was surprised the first time they came to a bridge inside the city—a low arch of stone over a
waterway no more than thirty paces across—but by the third such bridge, he realized that Illian was
crisscrossed by as many canals as streets, with men poling laden barges as often as plying whips to
move heavy wagons. Sedan chairs wove through the crowds in the streets, and occasionally the
lacquered coach of some wealthy merchant or a noble, with crest or House sign painted large on the
doors. Many of the men wore peculiar beards that left their upper lip bare, while the women seemed
to favor hats with wide brims and attached scarves that they wound around their necks.
Once they crossed a great square, many hides in extent, surrounded by huge columns of white
marble at least fifteen spans tall and two spans thick, supporting nothing but a wreath of carved olive
branches at the top of each. A huge, white palace stood at either end of the square, each all columned
walks and airy balconies, slender towers and purple roofs. Each reflected the other exactly, at first
glance, but then Perrin realized that one was just a fraction smaller in each dimension, its towers
perhaps less than a pace shorter.
“The King’s Palace,” Zarine said against his back, “and the Great Hall of the Council. It is said
the first King of Illian said the Council of Nine could have any palace they wished, just as long as
they did not try to build one larger than his. So the Council copied the King’s palace exactly, but two
feet smaller in every measurement. That has been the way of Illian ever since. The King and the
Council of Nine duel with each other, and the Assemblage struggles with both, and so while they
carry on their battles, the people live much as they wish, with none to look over their shoulders too
much. It is not a bad way to live, if you must be tied to one city. You would also like to know, I think,
blacksmith, that this is the Square of Tammaz, where I took the Hunter’s Oath. I think I will end up
teaching you so much, no one will notice the hay in your hair.”
Perrin held his tongue with an effort, resolving not to stare so openly again.

No one seemed to take Loial as anything much out of the ordinary. A few people looked at him
twice, and some small children scampered along in their wake for a time, but it appeared that Ogier
were not unknown in Illian. None of the folk seemed to notice the heat or the damp, either.
For once, Loial did not appear pleased with the people’s acceptance. His long eyebrows
drooped down on his cheeks, and his ears had wilted, though Perrin was not sure that was not just the
air. His own shirt clung to him with a mixture of sweat and the damp air.
“Are you afraid you’ll find other Ogier here, Loial?” he asked. He felt Zarine stir against his
back and cursed his tongue. He meant to let the woman know even less than Moiraine apparently
meant to tell her. That way, perhaps, she would grow bored enough to leave. If Moiraine will let her
go, now. Burn me, I don’t want any bloody falcon perched on my shoulder, even if she is pretty.
Loial nodded. “Our stonemasons sometimes come here.” He spoke in a whisper not only for an
Ogier, but for anyone. Even Perrin could barely hear. “From Stedding Shangtai, I mean. It was
masons from our stedding who built part of Illian—the Palace of the Assemblage, the Great Hall of
the Council, some of the others—and they always send to us when repairs need to be done. Perrin, if
there are Ogier here, they will make me go back to the stedding. I should have thought of it before
now. This place makes me uneasy, Perrin.” His ears shifted nervously.
Perrin moved Stepper closer and reached up to pat Loial’s shoulder. It was a long reach, above
his head. Conscious of Zarine at his back, he chose his words carefully. “Loial, I do not believe
Moiraine would let them take you. You have been with us a long time, and she seems to want you
with us. She will not let them take you, Loial.” Why not? he wondered suddenly. She keeps me
because she thinks I may be important to Rand, and maybe because she doesn’t want me telling
what I know to anyone. Maybe that’s why she wants him to stay.
“Of course, she would not,” Loial said in a slightly stronger voice, and his ears perked up. “I am
very useful, after all. She may need to travel the Ways again, and she could not without me.” Zarine
shifted against Perrin’s back, and he shook his head, trying to catch Loial’s eye. But Loial was not
looking. He seemed to have just heard what he had said, and the tufts on his ears had fallen a little. “I
do hope it’s not that, Perrin.” The Ogier looked at the city around them, and his ears went all the way
back down. “I do not like this place, Perrin.”
Moiraine rode closer to Lan and spoke softly, but Perrin managed to catch her words.
“Something is wrong in this city.” The Warder nodded.
Perrin felt an itch between his shoulders. The Aes Sedai had sounded grim. First Loial, and now
her. What don’t I see? The sun shone down on the sparkling roof tiles, made reflections from pale
stone walls. Those buildings looked as if they might be cool, inside. The buildings were clean and
bright, and so were the people. The people.
At first he saw nothing out of the ordinary. Men and women moving about their business,
purposeful, but slower than he was used to further north. He thought it might be the heat, and the bright
sun. Then he spotted a baker’s lad trotting down the street with a big tray of fresh loaves balanced on
his head; the young fellow wore a grimace on his face that was nearly a snarl. A woman in front of a
weaver’s shop looked as if she might bite the man holding up the bright-colored bolts for her
inspection. A juggler on a corner ground his teeth and stared at the folk who tossed coins into the cap
lying in front of him as if he hated them. Not everyone looked so, but it seemed to him that at least one
face in five wore anger and hatred. And he did not think they were even aware of it.
“What is the matter?” Zarine asked. “You are tensing. It is like holding on to a rock.”
“Something is wrong,” he told her. “I do not know what, but something is wrong.” Loial nodded
sadly, and murmured about how they would make him go back.

The buildings around them began to change as they rode, crossing more bridges as they crossed
Illian to its other side. The pale stone was as often undressed as polished, now. The towers and
palaces vanished, to be replaced by inns and warehouses. Many of the men in the streets, and some of
the women, had an oddly rolling gait; they all had the bare feet he associated with sailors. The smells
of pitch and hemp were strong in the air, and the scent of wood, both freshly cut and cured, with sour
mud overlying both. The canals’ odors changed, too, making his nose wrinkle. Chamber pots, he
thought. Chamber pots and old privies. It made him feel queasy.
“The Bridge of Flowers,” Lan announced as they crossed yet another low bridge. He inhaled
deeply. “And now we are in the Perfumed Quarter. The Illianers are a poetic people.”
Zarine stifled a laugh against Perrin’s back.
As if he were suddenly impatient with the slow pace of Illian, the Warder led them quickly
through the streets to an inn, two stories of rough, green-veined stone topped with pale green tiles.
Evening was coming on, the light growing softer as the sun settled. It gave a little relief from the heat,
but not much. Boys seated on mounting blocks in front of the inn hopped up to take their horses. One
black-haired lad about ten asked Loial if he were an Ogier, and when Loial said he was, the boy said,
“I did think you did be,” with a self-satisfied nod. He led Loial’s big horse away, tossing the copper
Loial had given him into the air and catching it.
Perrin frowned up at the inn sign for a moment before following the others in. A white-striped
badger danced on its hind legs with a man carrying what seemed to be a silver shovel. Easing the
Badger, it read. It must be some story I never heard.
The common room had sawdust on the floor, and tabac smoke filled the air. It also smelled of
wine, and fish cooking in the kitchen, and a heavy, flowered perfume. The exposed beams of the high
ceiling were rough-hewn and age-dark. This early in the evening, no more than a quarter of the stools
and benches were filled, by men in workmen’s plain coats and vests, some with the bare feet of
sailors. All of them sat clustered as close as they could manage around one table where a pretty,
dark-eyed girl, the wearer of the perfume, sang to the strumming of a twelve-string bittern and danced
on the tabletop with swirls of her skirt. Her loose, white blouse had an extremely low neck. Perrin
recognized the tune—“The Dancing Lass”—but the words the girl sang were different from what he
knew.
“A Lugard girl, she came to town, to see what she could see.
With a wink of her eye, and a smile on her lip,
she snagged a boy or three, or three.
With an ankle slim, and skin so pale,
she caught the owner of a ship, a ship.
With a soft little sigh, and a gay little laugh,
she made her way so free. So free.”
She launched into another verse, and when Perrin realized what she was singing, his face grew
hot. He had thought nothing could shock him after seeing Tinker girls dance, but that had only hinted at
things. This girl was singing them right out.
Zarine was nodding in time to the music and grinning. Her grin widened when she looked at him.
“Why, farmboy, I do not think I ever knew a man your age who could still blush.”
He glared at her and barely stopped himself from saying something he knew would be stupid.
This bloody woman has me jumping before I can think. Light, I’ll wager she thinks I never even
kissed a girl! He tried not to listen to any more of what the girl was singing. If he could not get the red

out of his face, Zarine was sure to make more of it.
A flash of startlement had passed across the face of the proprietress when they entered. A large,
round woman with her hair in a thick roll at the back of her neck and a smell of strong soap about her,
she suppressed her surprise quickly, though, and hurried to Moiraine.
“Mistress Mari,” she said, “I did never think to see you here today.” She hesitated, eyeing Perrin
and Zarine, glanced once at Loial, but not in the searching way she looked at them. Her eyes actually
brightened at the sight of the Ogier, but her real attention was all on “Mistress Mari.” She lowered
her voice, “Have my pigeons no arrived safely?” Lan, she seemed to accept as a part of Moiraine.
“I am sure they have, Nieda,” Moiraine said. “I have been away, but I am sure Adine has noted
down everything you reported.” She eyed the girl singing on the table with no outward disapproval,
nor any other expression. “The Badger was considerably quieter when last I was here.”
“Aye, Mistress Mari, it did be that. But the louts have no gotten over the winter yet, it does
seem. I have no had a fight in the Badger in ten years, till the tail of this winter gone.” She nodded
toward the one man not sitting near the singer, a fellow even bigger than Perrin, standing against the
wall with his thick arms folded, tapping his foot to the music. “Even Bili did have a hard time
keeping them down, so I did hire the girl to take their minds from anger. From some place in Altara,
she does come.” She tilted her head, listening for a moment. “A fair voice, but I did sing it better—
aye, and dance better, too—when I did be her age.”
Perrin gaped at the thought of this huge woman capering on a table, singing that song—a bit of it
came through; “I’ll wear no shift at all. At all”—until Zarine fisted him hard in the short ribs. He
grunted.
Nieda looked his way. “I’ll mix you some honey and sulphur, lad, for that throat. You’ll no want
to take a chill before the weather warms, no with a pretty girl like that one on your arm.”
Moiraine gave him a look that said he was interfering with her. “Strange that you should suffer
fights,” she said. “I well remember how your nephew stops such. Has something occurred to make
people more irritable?”
Nieda mused for a moment. “Perhaps. It do be hard to say. The young lordlings do always come
down to the docks for the wenching and carousing they can no get away with where the air does smell
fresher. Perhaps they do come more often, now, since the hard of the winter. Perhaps. And others do
snap at each other more, too. It did be a hard winter. That does make men angrier, and women as
well. All that rain, and cold. Why, I did wake two mornings to find ice in my washbasin. No so hard
as the last winter, of course, but that did be a winter for a thousand years. Almost enough to make me
believe those travelers’ tales of frozen water falling from the sky.” She giggled to show how little she
believed that. It was an odd sound from such a large woman.
Perrin shook his head. She doesn’t believe in snow? But if she thought this weather was cool, he
could believe it of her.
Moiraine bent her head in thought, her hood shadowing her face.
The girl on the table was beginning a new verse, and Perrin found himself listening in spite of
himself. He had never heard of any woman doing anything remotely like what the girl was singing
about, but it did sound interesting. He noticed Zarine watching him listen, and tried to pretend he had
not been.
“What has occurred out of the ordinary in Illian of late?” Moiraine said finally.
“I do suppose you could call Lord Brend’s ascension to the Council of Nine unusual,” Nieda
said. “Fortune prick me, I can no remember ever hearing his name before the winter, but he did come
to the city—from somewhere near the Murandian border, it be rumored—and did be raised inside a

week. It do be said he be a good man, and strongest of the Nine—they all do follow his lead, it be
said, though he be newest and unknown—but sometimes I do have strange dreams of him.”
Moiraine had opened her mouth—to tell Nieda she had meant in the last few nights, Perrin was
sure—but she hesitated, and instead said, “What sort of strange dreams, Nieda?”
“Oh, foolishness, Mistress Mari. Just foolishness. You do truly wish to hear it? Dreams of Lord
Brend in strange places, and walking bridges hanging in air. All fogged, these dreams do be, but near
every night they do come. Did you ever hear of such? Foolishness, Fortune prick me! Yet, it do be
odd. Bili does say he does dream the same dreams. I do think he does hear my dreams and copy them.
Bili do be none too bright, sometimes, I do think.”
“You may do him an injustice,” Moiraine breathed.
Perrin stared at her dark hood. She had sounded shaken, even more shaken than when she thought
a new false Dragon had risen in Ghealdan. He could not smell fear, but. . . . Moiraine was frightened.
It was a far more terrifying thought than Moiraine angry. He could imagine her angry; he could not
begin to conceive of her afraid.
“How I do maunder on,” Nieda said, patting the rolled hair at the back of her neck. “As if my
foolish dreams do be important.” She giggled again. A quick giggle; this was not as foolish as
believing in snow. “You do sound tired, Mistress Mari. I will show you to your rooms. And then a
good meal of fresh-caught red-stripe.”
Red-stripe? A fish, he thought it must be; he could smell fish cooking.
“Rooms,” Moiraine said. “Yes. We will take rooms. The meal can wait. Ships. Nieda, what
ships sail for Tear? Early on the morrow. I have that which I must do tonight.” Lan glanced at her,
frowning.
“For Tear, Mistress Mari?” Nieda laughed. “Why, none for Tear. The Nine did forbid any ship
to sail for Tear a month gone now, nor any from Tear to call here, though I do think the Sea Folk pay
it no mind. But there do be no Sea Folk ship in the harbor. It do be odd, that. The order of the Nine, I
do mean, and the King silent on it, when he does always raise his voice if they but take a step without
his lead. Or perhaps it be no that, exactly. All talk do be of war with Tear, but the boatmen and
wagoneers who do carry supplies to the army do say the soldiers do all look north, to Murandy.”
“The paths of the Shadow are tangled,” Moiraine said in a tight voice. “We will do what we
must. The rooms, Nieda. And then we will eat that meal.”
Perrin’s room was more comfortable than he expected, given the look of the rest of the Badger.
The bed was wide, the mattress soft. The door was made of tilted slats, and when he opened the
windows, a breeze crossed the room carrying the smells of the harbor. And something of the canals,
too, but at least it was cooling. He hung his cloak on a peg along with his quiver and axe, and
propped his bow in the corner. Everything else he left in the saddlebags and blanketroll. The night
might not be restful.
If Moiraine had sounded afraid before, it had been nothing to when she said that something must
be done tonight. For an instant then, fear scent had steamed from her as from a woman announcing that
she was going to stick her hand in a hornets’ nest and crush them with her bare fingers. What in the
Light is she up to? If Moiraine is frightened, I should be terrified.
He was not, he realized. Not terrified, or even frightened. He felt . . . excited. Ready for
something to happen, almost eager. Determined. He recognized the feelings. They were what wolves
felt just before they fought. Burn me, I’d rather be afraid!
He was first back down to the common except for Loial. Nieda had arranged a large table for
them, with ladder-back chairs instead of benches. She had even found a chair big enough for Loial.

The girl across the room was singing a song about a rich merchant who, having just lost his team of
horses in an improbable way, had for some reason decided to pull his carriage himself. The men
listening around her roared with laughter. The windows showed darkness coming on more quickly
than he had expected; the air smelled as if it might be making up to rain.
“This inn has an Ogier room,” Loial said as Perrin sat down. “Apparently, every inn in Illian has
one, in hopes of gaining Ogier custom when the stonemasons come. Nieda claims it is lucky, having
an Ogier under the roof. I cannot think they get many. The masons always stay together when they go
Outside to work. Humans are so hasty, and the Elders are always afraid tempers will flare and
someone will put a long handle on his axe.” He eyed the men around the singer as if he suspected
them of it. His ears were drooping again.
The rich merchant was in the process of losing his carriage, to more laughter. “Did you find out
whether any Ogier from Stedding Shangtai are in Illian?”
“There were, but Nieda said they left during the winter. She said they had not finished their
work. I do not understand it. The masons would not have left work undone unless they were not paid,
and Nieda said it was not that. One morning, they were just gone, though someone saw them walking
down the Maredo Causeway in the night. Perrin, I do not like this city. I do not know why, but it
makes me . . . uneasy.”
“Ogier,” Moiraine said, “are sensitive to some things.” She still had her face hidden, but Nieda
had apparently sent someone to buy her a light cloak of dark blue linen. The fear smell was gone from
her, but her voice sounded under tight control. Lan held her chair for her; his eyes looked worried.
Zarine was the last down, running her fingers through just-washed hair. The herbal scent was
stronger around her than before. She stared at the platter Nieda placed on the table and muttered under
her breath. “I hate fish.”
The stout woman had brought all the food on a small cart with shelves; it was dusty in places, as
if it had been hastily brought out from the storeroom in Moiraine’s honor. The dishes were Sea Folk
porcelain, too, if chipped.
“Eat,” Moiraine said, looking straight at Zarine. “Remember that any meal can be your last. You
chose to travel with us, so tonight you will eat fish. Tomorrow, you may die.”
Perrin did not recognize the nearly round white fish with red stripes, but they smelled good. He
lifted two onto his plate with the serving fork, and grinned at Zarine around a mouthful. They tasted
good, too, lightly spiced. Eat your nasty fish, falcon, he thought. He also thought that Zarine looked
as if she might bite him.
“Do you wish me to stop the girl singing, Mistress Mari?” Nieda asked. She was setting bowls
of peas and some sort of stiff yellow mush on the table. “So you can eat in quiet?”
Staring at her plate, Moiraine did not seem to hear.
Lan listened a moment—the merchant had already lost, in succession, his carriage, his cloak, his
boots, his gold, and the rest of his clothes, and was now reduced to wrestling a pig for its dinner—
and shook his head. “She will not bother us.” He looked close to smiling for a moment, before he
glanced at Moiraine. Then the worry returned to his eyes.
“What is wrong?” Zarine said. She was ignoring the fish. “I know something is. I have not see
that much expression on you, stone-face, since I met you.”
“No questions!” Moiraine said sharply. “You will know what I tell you and no more!”
“What will you tell me?” Zarine demanded.
The Aes Sedai smiled. “Eat your fish.”
The meal went on in near silence after that, except for the songs drifting across the room. There

was one about a rich man whose wife and daughters made a fool of him time and again without ever
deflating his self-importance, another that concerned a young woman who decided to take a walk
without any clothes, and one that told of a blacksmith who managed to shoe himself instead of the
horse. Zarine nearly choked laughing at that one, forgot herself enough to take a bite of fish, and
suddenly grimaced as if she had put mud in her mouth.
I won’t laugh at her, Perrin told himself. However foolish she looks, I’ll show her what
manners are. “They taste good, don’t they,” he said. Zarine gave him a bitter look, and Moiraine a
frown for interrupting her thoughts, and that was all the talk there was.
Nieda was clearing away the dishes and setting an array of cheeses on the table when a stink of
something vile lifted the hackles on the back of Perrin’s neck. It was a smell of something that should
not be, and he had smelled it twice before. He peered about the common room uneasily.
The girl still sang to the knot of listeners, some men were strolling across the floor from the
door, and Bili still leaned on the wall tapping his foot to the sounds of the bittern. Nieda patted her
rolled hair, gave the room a quick glance, and turned to push the cart away.
He looked at his companions. Loial, unsurprisingly, had pulled a book from his coat pocket and
seemed to have forgotten where he was. Zarine, absently rolling a piece of white cheese into a ball,
was eyeing first Perrin, then Moiraine, then him again, while trying to pretend she was not. It was Lan
and Moiraine he was really interested in, though. They could sense a Myrddraal, or a Trolloc, or any
Shadowspawn, before it came closer than a few hundred paces, but the Aes Sedai was staring
distantly at the table in front of her, and the Warder was cutting a chunk of yellow cheese and
watching her. Yet the smell of wrongness was there, as at Jarra and the edge of Remen, and this time
it was not going away. It seemed to be coming from something within the common room.
He studied the room again. Bili against the wall, some men crossing the floor, the girl singing on
the table, all the laughing men sitting around her. Men crossing the floor? He frowned at them. Six
men with ordinary faces, walking toward where he was sitting. Very ordinary faces. He was just
starting to reinspect the men listening to the girl when suddenly it came to him that the stink of
wrongness was rolling from the six. Abruptly they had daggers in their hands, as if they had realized
he had seen them.
“They have knives!” he roared, and threw the cheese platter at them.
The common erupted into confusion, men shouting, the singer screaming, Nieda shouting for Bili,
everything happening at once. Lan leaped to his feet, and a ball of fire darted from Moiraine’s hand,
and Loial snatched up his chair like a club, and Zarine danced to one side, cursing. She had a knife in
her hand, too, but Perrin was too busy to notice much of what anyone else did. Those men seemed to
be looking straight at him, and his axe was hanging from a peg up in his room.
Seizing a chair, he ripped off a thick chair leg that ran up to make one side of the ladder-back,
hurled the rest of the chair at the men, and set about him with his long bludgeon. They were trying to
reach him with their naked steel, as if Lan and the others were only obstacles in their way. It was a
tight tangle where all he could manage was to knock blades away from him, and his wilder swings
threatened Lan and Loial and Zarine as much as any of his six attackers. From the corner of his eye he
saw Moiraine standing to one side, frustration on her face; they were all so mixed together that she
could do nothing without endangering friend as well as foe. None of the knife wielders as much as
glanced at her; she was not between them and Perrin.
Panting, he managed to crack one of the ordinary-looking men across the head so hard that he
heard bone splinter, and abruptly realized they were all down. It all seemed to him to have gone on
for a quarter of a hour or more, but he saw that Bili was just halting, his large hands working as he

stared at the six men sprawled dead on the floor. Bili had not even had time to reach the fight before it
was done.
Lan wore a face even grimmer than usual; he began searching the bodies, thoroughly, but with a
quickness that spoke of distaste. Loial still had his chair raised to swing; he gave a start and set it
down with an embarrassed grin. Moiraine was staring at Perrin, and so was Zarine as she retrieved
her knife from the chest of one of the dead men. That stench of wrongness was gone, as if it had died
with them.
“Gray Men,” the Aes Sedai said softly, “and after you.”
“Gray Men?” Nieda laughed, both loud and nervously. “Why, Mistress Mari, next you’ll say you
do believe in boggles and bugbears and Fetches, and Old Grim riding with the black dogs in the Wild
Hunt.” Some of the men who had been listening to the songs laughed, too, though they looked as
uneasily at Moiraine as at the dead men. The singer stared at Moiraine, as well, her eyes wide. Perrin
remembered that one ball of fire, before everything grew too jumbled. One of the Gray Men had a
somewhat charred look about him, and gave off a sickly sweet burned smell.
Moiraine turned from Perrin to the stout woman. “A man may walk in the Shadow,” the Aes
Sedai said calmly, “without being Shadowspawn.”
“Oh, aye, Darkfriends.” Nieda put her hands on generous hips and frowned at the corpses. Lan
had finished his searching; he glanced at Moiraine and shook his head as if he had not really expected
to find anything. “More likely thieves, though I did never hear of thieves bold enough to come right
into an inn. I did never have even one killing in the Badger before. Bili! Clear these out, into a canal,
and put down fresh sawdust. The back way, mind. I do no want the Watch putting their long noses into
the Badger.” Bili nodded as if eager to be useful after failing to take a hand earlier. He grabbed a
dead man by the belt in either hand and carried them back toward the kitchen.
“Aes Sedai?” the dark-eyed singer said. “I did not mean to offend with my common songs.” She
was covering the exposed part of her bosom, which was most of it, with her hands. “I can sing others,
if you would so like.”
“Sing whatever you wish, girl,” Moiraine told her. “The White Tower is not so isolated from the
world as you seem to think, and I have heard rougher songs than you would sing.” Even so, she did
not look pleased that the common now knew she was Aes Sedai. She glanced at Lan, gathered the
linen cloak around her, and started for the door.
The Warder moved quickly to intercept her, and they spoke quietly in front of the door, but
Perrin could hear as well as if they whispered right next to him.
“Do you mean to go without me?” Lan said. “I pledged to keep you whole, Moiraine, when I
took your bond.”
“You have always known there were some dangers you are not equipped to handle, my Gaidin. I
must go alone.”
“Moiraine—”
She cut him off. “Heed me, Lan. Should I fail, you will know it, and you will be compelled to
return to the White Tower. I would not change that even if I had time. I do not mean you to die in a
vain attempt to avenge me. Take Perrin with you. It seems the Shadow has made his importance in the
Pattern known to me, if not clear. I was a fool. Rand is so strongly ta’veren that I ignored what it must
mean that he had two others close by him. With Perrin and Mat, the Amyrlin may still be able to affect
the course of events. With Rand loose, she will have to. Tell her what has happened, my Gaidin.”
“You speak as if you are already dead,” Lan said roughly.
“The Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills, and the Shadow darkens the world. Heed me, Lan, and

obey, as you swore to.” With that, she was gone.

CHAPTER

Shadowbrothers

The dark-eyed girl climbed back on her table and started singing again, in an unsteady voice.
The tune was one Perrin knew as “Mistress Aynora’s Rooster,” and though the words were different
once more, to his disappointment—and embarrassment that he was disappointed—it actually was
about a rooster. Mistress Luhhan herself would not have disapproved. Light, I’m getting as bad as
Mat.
None of the listeners complained; some of the men did look a bit disgruntled, but they seemed to
be as anxious about what Moiraine might approve as the singer was. No one wished to offend an Aes
Sedai, even with her gone. Bili came back and hoisted two more Gray Men; a few of the men
listening to the song glanced at the corpses and shook their heads. One of them spat on the sawdust.
Lan came to stand in front of Perrin. “How did you know them, blacksmith?” he asked quietly.
“Their taint of evil is not strong enough for Moiraine or me to sense. Gray Men have walked past a
hundred guards without being noticed, and Warders among them.”
Very conscious of Zarine’s eyes on him, Perrin tried to make his voice even softer than Lan’s. “I
. . . I smelled them. I’ve smelled them before, at Jarra and at Remen, but it always vanished. They
were gone before we got there, both times.” He was not sure whether Zarine had overheard or not;
she was leaning forward trying to listen, and trying to appear not to at the same time.
“Following Rand, then. Following you, now, blacksmith.” The Warder gave no visible sign of
surprise. He raised his voice to a more normal level. “I am going to look around outside, blacksmith.
Your eyes might see something I miss.” Perrin nodded; it was a measure of the Warder’s worry that
he asked for help. “Ogier, your folk see better than most, too.”
“Oh, ah,” Loial said. “Well, I suppose I could take a look, too.” His big, round eyes rolled
sideways toward the two Gray Men still on the floor. “I would not think any more of them were out
there. Would you?”
“What are we looking for, stone-face?” Zarine said.
Lan eyed her a moment, then shook his head as if he had decided not to say something.
“Whatever we find, girl. I will know it when I see it.”
Perrin thought about going upstairs for his axe, but the Warder made for the door, and he was not
wearing his sword. He hardly needs it, Perrin thought grumpily. He is almost as dangerous without
it as with. He held on to the chair leg as he followed. It was a relief to see that Zarine still had her
knife in her hand.
Thick black clouds were roiling overhead. The street was as dark as late twilight, and empty of
people who had apparently not waited to be caught in the rain. One fellow was running across a
bridge down the street; he was the only person Perrin saw in any direction. The wind was picking up,
blowing a rag along the uneven paving stones; another, caught under the edge of one of the mounting

blocks, flapped with a small snapping sound. Thunder grumbled and rolled.
Perrin wrinkled his nose. There was a smell of fireworks on that wind. No, not fireworks,
exactly. It was a burned sulphur sort of smell. Almost.
Zarine tapped the chair leg in his hands with her knife blade. “You really are strong, big man.
You tore that chair apart as if it were made of twigs.”
Perrin grunted. He realized he was standing straighter, and deliberately made himself slouch.
Fool girl! Zarine laughed softly, and suddenly he did not know whether to straighten or stay as he
was. Fool! This time he meant it for himself. You’re supposed to be looking. For what? He did not
see anything but the street, did not smell anything but the almost burned sulphur scent. And Zarine, of
course.
Loial appeared to be wondering what it was he was looking for, too. He scratched a tufted ear,
peered one way down the street, then the other, then scratched the other ear. Then he stared up at the
roof of the inn.
Lan appeared from the alleyway beside the inn and moved out into the street, eyes studying the
darker shadows along the buildings.
“Maybe he missed seeing something,” Perrin muttered, though he found it hard to believe, and
turned toward the alley. I am supposed to be looking, so I’ll look. Maybe he did miss something.
Lan had stopped a little way down the street, staring at the paving stones in front of his feet. The
Warder started back toward the inn, walking quickly, but peering at the street ahead of him as if
following something. Whatever it was led straight to one of the mounting blocks, almost beside the
inn door. He stopped there, staring at the top of the gray stone block.
Perrin decided to abandon going down the alley—it stank as much as the canals in this part of
Illian, for one thing—and walked over to Lan, instead. He saw what the Warder was staring at right
away. Pressed into the top of the stone mounting block were two prints, as if a huge hound had rested
its forepaws there. The smell that was almost burned sulphur was strongest here. Dogs don’t make
footprints in stone. Light, they don’t! He could make out the trail Lan had followed, too. The hound
had trotted up the street as far as the mounting block, then turned and gone back the way it had come.
Leaving tracks in the stone as if they had been a plowed field. They just don’t!
“Darkhound,” Lan said, and Zarine gasped. Loial moaned softly. For an Ogier. “A Darkhound
leaves no mark on dirt, blacksmith, not even on mud, but stone is another matter. There hasn’t been a
Darkhound seen south of the Mountains of Dhoom since the Trolloc Wars. This one was hunting for
something, I’d say. And now that it has found it, it has gone to tell its master.”
Me? Perrin thought. Gray Men and Darkhounds hunting me? This is crazy!
“Are you telling me Nieda was right?” Zarine demanded in a shaky voice. “Old Grim is really
riding with the Wild Hunt? Light! I always thought it was just a story.”
“Don’t be a complete fool, girl,” Lan said harshly. “If the Dark One were free, we’d all be
worse than dead by now.” He peered off down the street, the way the tracks went. “But Darkhounds
are real enough. Almost as dangerous as Myrddraal, and harder to kill.”
“Now you bring Fetches into it,” Zarine muttered. “Gray Men. Fetches. Darkhounds. You had
better lead me to the Horn of Valere, farmboy. What other surprises do you have waiting for me?”
“No questions,” Lan told her. “You still know little enough that Moiraine will release you from
your oath, if you swear not to follow. I’ll take that oath myself, and you can go now. You would be
wise to give it.”
“You will not frighten me away, stone-face,” Zarine said. “I do not frighten easily.” But she
sounded frightened. And smelled it, too.

“I have a question,” Perrin said, “and I want an answer. You didn’t sense this Darkhound, Lan,
and neither did Moiraine. Why not?”
The Warder was silent for a time. “The answer to that, blacksmith,” he said grimly at last, “may
be more than you or I, either one, want to know. I hope the answer does not kill us all. You three get
what sleep you can. I doubt we will stay the night in Illian, and I fear we have hard riding ahead.”
“What are you going to do?” Perrin asked.
“I am going after Moiraine. To tell her about the Darkhound. She can’t be angry with me for
following for that, not when she would not know it was there until it took her throat.”
The first big drops of rain splatted on the paving stones as they went back inside. Bili had
removed the last of the dead Gray Men and was sweeping up the sawdust where they had bled. The
dark-eyed girl was singing a sad song about a boy leaving his love. Mistress Luhhan would have
enjoyed it greatly.
Lan ran ahead of them, across the common room and up the stairs, and by the time Perrin reached
the second floor, the Warder was already starting back down, buckling his sword belt on, colorshifting cloak hanging over his arm as if he hardly cared who saw it.
“If he is wearing that in a city. . . .” Loial’s shaggy hair almost brushed the ceiling as he shook
his head. “I do not know if I can sleep, but I will try. Dreams will be more pleasant than staying
awake.”
Not always, Loial, Perrin thought as the Ogier went on down the hall.
Zarine seemed to want to stay with him, but he told her to go to sleep and firmly shut the slatted
door in her face. He stared at his own bed reluctantly as he stripped down to his underbreeches.
“I have to find out,” he sighed, and crawled onto the bed. Rain drummed down outside, and
thunder boomed. The breeze across his bed carried some of the rain’s coolness, but he did not think
he would need any of the blankets at the foot of the mattress. His last thought before sleep claimed
him was that he had forgotten to light a candle again, though the room was dark. Careless. Mustn’t be
careless. Carelessness ruins the work.
Dreams tumbled through his head. Darkhounds chasing him; he never saw them, but he could
hear their howling. Fades, and Gray Men. A tall, slender man flashed into them again and again, in
richly embroidered coat and boots with gold fringe; most of the time he held what seemed to be a
sword, shining like the sun, and laughed triumphantly. Sometimes the man sat on a throne, and kings
and queens groveled before him. These felt strange, as if they were not really his dreams at all.
Then the dreams changed, and he knew he was in the wolf dream he sought. This time he had
hoped for it.
He stood atop a high, flat-topped stone spire, the wind ruffling his hair, bringing a thousand dry
scents and a faint hint of water hidden in the far distance. For an instant he thought he had the form of
a wolf, and fumbled at his own body to make sure what he saw was really him. He wore his own coat
and breeches and boots; he held his bow, and his quiver hung at his side. The axe was not there.
“Hopper! Hopper, where are you?” The wolf did not come.
Rugged mountains surrounded him, and other tall spires separated by arid flats and jumbled
ridges, and sometimes a large plateau rising with sheer sides. Things grew, but nothing lush. Tough,
short grass. Bushes wiry and covered with thorn, and other things that even seemed to have thorns on
their fat leaves. Scattered, stunted trees, twisted by the wind. Yet wolves could find hunting even in
this land.
As he peered at this rough land, a circle of darkness suddenly blanked out a part of the

mountains; he could not have said whether the darkness was right in front of his face or halfway to the
mountains, but he seemed to be seeing through it, and beyond. Mat, rattling a dice cup. His opponent
stared at Mat with eyes of fire. Mat did not seem to see the man, but Perrin knew him.
“Mat!” he shouted. “It’s Ba’alzamon! Light, Mat, you’re dicing with Ba’alzamon!”
Mat made his toss, and as the dice spun, the vision faded, and the dark place was dry mountains
again.
“Hopper!” Perrin turned slowly, looking in every direction. He even looked up in the sky—He
can fly, now—where clouds promised a rain the ground far below the spire top would drink up as
soon as it fell. “Hopper!”
A darkness formed among the clouds, a hole into somewhere else. Egwene and Nynaeve and
Elayne stood looking at a huge metal cage, with a raised door held on a heavy spring. They stepped in
and reached up together to loose the catch. The barred door snapped down behind them. A woman
with her hair all in braids laughed at them, and another woman all in white laughed at her. The hole in
the sky closed, and there were only clouds.
“Hopper, where are you?” he called. “I need you! Hopper!”
And the grizzled wolf was there, alighting on the spire top as if he had leaped from somewhere
higher.
Dangerous. You have been warned, Young Bull. Too young. Too new yet.
“I need to know, Hopper. You said there were things I must see. I need to see more, know
more.” He hesitated, thinking of Mat, of Egwene and Nynaeve and Elayne. “The strange things I see
here. Are they real?” Hopper’s sending seemed slow, as if it were so simple the wolf could not
understand the need to explain it, or how to. Finally, though, something came.
What is real is not real. What is not real is real. Flesh is a dream, and dreams have flesh.
“That doesn’t tell me anything, Hopper. I do not understand.” The wolf looked at him, as if he
had said he did not understand that water was wet. “You said I had to see something, and you showed
me Ba’alzamon, and Lanfear.”
Heartfang. Moonhunter.
“Why did you show me, Hopper? Why did I have to see them?”
The Last Hunt comes. Sadness filled the sending, and a sense of inevitability. What will be must
be.
“I do not understand! The Last Hunt? What Last Hunt? Hopper, Gray Men came to kill me
tonight.”
The Notdead hunt you?
“Yes! Gray Men! After me! And a Darkhound was right outside the inn! I want to know why
they’re after me.”
Shadowbrothers! Hopper crouched, looking to either side as if he almost expected an attack.
Long since we have seen the Shadowbrothers. You must go, Young Bull. Great danger! Flee the
Shadowbrothers!
“Why are they after me, Hopper? You do know. I know you do!”
Flee, Young Bull. Hopper leaped, forepaws hitting Perrin’s chest, knocking him back, over the
edge. Flee the Shadowbrothers.
The wind rushed in his ears as he fell. Hopper and the edge of the spire top dwindled above
him. “Why, Hopper?” he shouted. “I have to know why!”
The Last Hunt comes.
He was going to hit. He knew it. The ground below rushed up at him, and he tensed against the

crushing impact that. . . .
He started awake, staring at the candle flickering on the small table beside the bed. Lightning
flashes lit the window, and thunder rattled it. “What did he mean, the Last Hunt?” he mumbled. I did
not light any candle.
“You talk to yourself. And thrash in your sleep.”
He jumped, and cursed himself for not having noticed the herbal scent in the air. Zarine sat on a
stool at the edge of the candlelight, elbow on her knee, chin on her fist, watching him.
“You are ta’veren,” she said as if ticking off a point. “Stone-face thinks those odd eyes of yours
can see things his can’t. Gray Men want to kill you. You travel with an Aes Sedai, a Warder, and an
Ogier. You free caged Aiel and kill Whitecloaks. Who are you, farmboy, the Dragon Reborn?” Her
voice said that was the most ridiculous thing she could think of, but he still shifted uneasily.
“Whoever you are, big man,” she added, “you could do with a little more hair on your chest.”
He twisted around, cursing, and scrabbled one of the blankets over him to his neck. Light, she
keeps making me jump like a frog on a hot rock . Zarine’s face was at the edge of shadows. He could
not see her clearly except when lightning shone through the window, the harsh illumination casting its
own shadows across her strong nose and high cheekbones. Suddenly he remembered Min saying he
should run from a beautiful woman. Once he had recognized Lanfear in that wolf dream, he had
thought Min must mean her—he did not think it was possible for a woman to be any more beautiful
than Lanfear—but she was just in a dream. Zarine was sitting there staring at him with those dark,
tilted eyes, considering, weighing.
“What are you doing here?” he demanded. “What do you want? Who are you?”
She threw back her head and laughed. “I am Faile, farmboy, a Hunter of the Horn. Who do you
think I am, the woman of your dreams? Why did you jump that way? You would think I had goosed
you.”
Before he could find words, the door crashed back against the wall, and Moiraine stood in the
doorway, her face as pale and grim as death. “Your wolf dreams tell as truly as a Dreamer’s, Perrin.
The Forsaken are loose, and one of them rules in Illian.”

CHAPTER

Hunted

Perrin climbed off the bed and started dressing, not caring whether Zarine was watching or not.
He knew what he intended to do, but he asked Moiraine anyway. “Do we leave?”
“Unless you want to make closer acquaintance with Sammael,” she said dryly. Thunder crashed
overhead as if to punctuate her sentence, and lightning flashed. The Aes Sedai barely glanced at
Zarine.
Stuffing his shirttail into his breeches, he suddenly wished he had his coat and cloak on. Naming
which one of the Forsaken it was made the room seem cold. Ba’alzamon isn’t bad enough; we have
to have the Forsaken loose, too. Light, does it even matter if we find Rand, now? Is it too late? But
he kept dressing, stamping his feet into his boots. It was that or give up, and Two Rivers folk were
not known for giving up.
“Sammael?” Zarine said faintly. “One of the Forsaken rules . . . ? Light!”
“Do you still wish to follow?” Moiraine said softly. “I would not make you stay here, not now,
but I will give you one last chance to swear to go another way than I.”
Zarine hesitated, and Perrin paused with his coat half on. Surely no one would choose to go with
people who had incurred the wrath of one of the Forsaken. Not now that she knew something of what
they faced. Not unless she has a very good reason. For that matter, anyone who heard one of the
Forsaken was loose should already be running for a Sea Folk ship and asking passage to the other
side of the Aiel Waste, not sitting there thinking.
“No,” Zarine said finally, and he began to relax. “No, I will not swear to go another way.
Whether you lead me to the Horn of Valere or not, not even whoever does find the Horn will have a
story such as this. I think this story will be told for the ages, Aes Sedai, and I will be part of it.”
“No!” Perrin snapped. “That is not good enough. What do you want?”
“I have no time for this bickering,” Moiraine broke in. “Any moment Lord Brend may learn that
one of his Darkhounds is dead. You can be sure he will know that means a Warder, and he will come
looking for the Gaidin’s Aes Sedai. Do you mean to sit here until he discovers where you are? Move,
you foolish children! Move!” She vanished down the hall before he could open his mouth.
Zarine did not wait, either, running from the room without her candle. Perrin hastily gathered his
things and dashed for the back stairs still buckling his axe belt around his waist. He caught up to Loial
going down, the Ogier trying to stuff a wood-bound book into his saddlebags and put on his cloak at
the same time. Perrin gave him a hand with the cloak while they both ran down the stairs, and Zarine
caught the pair of them before they could dash out into the pouring rain.
Perrin hunched his shoulders against the wet and ran for the stable across the storm-darkened
yard without waiting to pull up the hood of his cloak. She has to have a reason. Being in a bloody
story isn’t reason enough for any but a madwoman! The rain soaked his shaggy curls, laying them

flat around his head, before he darted through the stable door.
Moiraine was there before them, in an oiled cloak still beaded with rain, and Nieda holding a
lantern for Lan to finish saddling the horses. There was an extra, a bay gelding with an even stronger
nose than Zarine’s.
“I will send pigeons every day,” the stout woman was saying. “No one will suspect me. Fortune
prick me! Even Whitecloaks do speak well of me.”
“Listen to me, woman!” Moiraine snapped. “This is not a Whitecloak or a Darkfriend I speak of.
You will flee this city, and make anyone you care for flee with you. For a dozen years you have
obeyed me. Obey me now!” Nieda nodded, but reluctantly, and Moiraine growled with exasperation.
“The bay is yours, girl,” Lan said to Zarine. “Get on his back. If you do not know how to ride,
you must learn by doing, or take my offer.”
Putting one hand on the high pommel, she vaulted easily into the saddle. “I was on a horse once,
stone-face, now that I think of it.” She twisted around to tie her bundle behind her.
“What did you mean, Moiraine?” Perrin demanded as he tossed his saddlebag across Stepper’s
back. “You said he would find out where I am. He knows. The Gray Men!” Nieda giggled, and he
wondered irritably how much she really knew or believed among the things she said she did not
believe in.
“Sammael did not send the Gray Men.” Moiraine mounted Aldieb with a cool, straight-backed
precision, almost as if there were no hurry. “The Darkhound was his, however. I believe it followed
my trail. He would not have sent both. Someone wants you, but I do not think Sammael even knows
you exist. Yet.” Perrin stopped with one foot in the stirrup, staring at her, but she seemed more
concerned with patting her mare’s arching neck than with the questions on his face.
“As well I went after you,” Lan said, and the Aes Sedai sniffed loudly.
“I could wish you were a woman, Gaidin. I would send you to the Tower as a novice to learn to
obey!” He raised an eyebrow and touched the hilt of his sword, then swung into his saddle, and she
sighed. “Perhaps it is as well you are disobedient. Sometimes it is well. Besides, I do not think
Sheriam and Siuan Sanche together could teach you obedience.”
“I do not understand,” Perrin said. I seem to be saying that a great deal, and I’m tired of it. I
want some answers I can understand. He pulled himself the rest of the way up so Moiraine would
not be looking down at him; she had enough advantage without that. “If he did not send the Gray Men,
who did? If a Myrddraal, or another Forsaken. . . .” He stopped to swallow. ANOTHER Forsaken!
Light! “If somebody else sent them, why did they not tell him? They’re all Darkfriends, aren’t they?
And why me, Moiraine? Why me? Rand is the bloody Dragon Reborn!”
He heard the gasps from Zarine and Nieda, and only then realized what he had said. Moiraine’s
stare seemed to skin him like the sharpest steel. Hasty bloody tongue. When did I stop thinking
before I speak? It seemed to him it had happened when he first felt Zarine’s eyes watching him. She
was watching him now, with her mouth hanging open.
“You are sealed to us, now,” Moiraine told the bold-faced woman. “There is no turning back for
you. Ever.” Zarine looked as if she wanted to say something and was afraid to, but the Aes Sedai had
already turned her attention elsewhere. “Nieda, flee Illian tonight. In this hour! And hold your tongue
even better than you have held it all these years. There are those who would cut it out for what you
could say, before I could even find you.” Her hard tone left doubts as to exactly how she meant that,
and Nieda nodded vigorously as if she had heard it both ways.
“As for you, Perrin.” The white mare moved closer, and he leaned back from the Aes Sedai
despite all he could do. “There are many threads woven in the Pattern, and some are as black as the

Shadow itself. Take care one of them does not strangle you.” Her heels touched Aldieb’s flanks, and
the mare darted into the rain, Mandarb following close behind.
Burn you, Moiraine, Perrin thought as he rode after them. Sometimes I do not know which side
you are on. He glanced at Zarine, riding beside him as if she had been born in a saddle. And whose
side are you on?
Rain kept people off the streets and canals, so no visible eyes watched them go, but it made the
footing uncertain for the horses on the uneven paving stones. By the time they reached the Maredo
Causeway, a wide road of packed dirt stretching north through the marsh, the downpour had begun to
slacken. Thunder still boomed, but the lightning flashed far behind them, perhaps out to sea.
Perrin felt a bit of luck was coming their way. The rain had stayed long enough to hide their
departure, but now it seemed they would have a clear night for riding. He said as much, but Lan shook
his head.
“Darkhounds like clear, moonlit nights best, blacksmith, rain the least. A good thunderstorm can
keep them away completely.” As if his words had bidden it, the rain faded to a faint drizzle. Perrin
heard Loial groan behind him.
Causeway and marsh ended together, some two miles or so from the city, but the road kept on,
slowly bearing a little eastward. Cloud-dark evening faded into night, and the misting rain continued.
Moiraine and Lan kept a steady, ground-eating pace. The horses’ hooves splashed through puddles on
the hard-packed dirt. The moon shone through gaps in the clouds. Low hills began to rise around
them, and trees to appear more and more often. Perrin thought there must be forest ahead, but he was
not sure how he liked the idea. Woods could hide them from pursuit; woods could let pursuit come
close before they saw.
A thin howl rose far behind them. For a moment he thought it was a wolf; he surprised himself
by nearly reaching out to the wolf before he could stop. The cry came again, and he knew it was no
wolf. Others answered it, all miles behind, eerie wails holding blood and death, cries that spoke of
nightmares. To his surprise, Lan and Moiraine slowed, the Aes Sedai studying the hills around them
in the night.
“They are a long way,” he said. “They’ll not catch us if we keep on.”
“The Darkhounds?” Zarine muttered. “Those are the Darkhounds? Are you sure it isn’t the Wild
Hunt, Aes Sedai?”
“But it is,” Moiraine replied. “It is.”
“You can never outrun the Darkhounds, blacksmith,” Lan said, “not on the fastest horse. Always,
you must face them and defeat them, or they will pull you down.”
“I could have stayed in the stedding, you know,” Loial said. “My mother would have had me
married by now, but it would not have been a bad life. Plenty of books. I did not have to come
Outside.”
“There,” Moiraine said, pointing to a tall, treeless mound well off to their right. There were no
trees that Perrin could see for two hundred paces or more around it, either, and they were still sparse
beyond that. “We must see them coming to have a chance.”
The Darkhounds’ dire cries rose again, closer, yet still far.
Lan quickened Mandarb’s pace a little, now that Moiraine had chosen their ground. As they
climbed, the horses’ hooves clattered on rocks half-buried in the dirt and slicked by the drizzle. To
Perrin’s eyes, most of them had too many squared corners to be natural. At the top, they dismounted
around what seemed to be a low, rounded boulder. The moon appeared through a gap in the clouds,
and he found himself looking at a weathered stone face two paces long. A woman’s face, he thought

from the length of the hair. The rain made her seem to be weeping.
Moiraine dismounted and stood looking off in the direction of the howls. She was a shadowed,
hooded shape, rain catching moonlight as it rolled down her oiled cloak.
Loial led his horse over to peer at the carving, then bent closer and felt the features. “I think she
was an Ogier,” he said at last. “But this is not an old stedding; I would feel it. We all would. And we
would be safe from Shadowspawn.”
“What are you two staring at?” Zarine squinted at the rock. “What is it? Her? Who?”
“Many nations have risen and fallen since the Breaking,” Moiraine said without turning, “some
leaving no more than names on a yellowed page, or lines on a tattered map. Will we leave as much
behind?” The blood-drenched howls rose again, still closer. Perrin tried to calculate their pace, and
thought Lan had been right; the horses could not have outrun them, after all. They would not have long
to wait.
“Ogier,” Lan said, “you and the girl hold the horses.” Zarine protested, but he rode straight over
to her. “Your knives will not do much good here, girl.” His sword blade gleamed in the moonlight as
he drew it. “Even this is a last resort. It sounds like ten out there, not one. Your work is to keep the
horses from running when they smell the Darkhounds. Even Mandarb does not like that smell.”
If the Warder’s sword was no good, then neither was the axe. Perrin felt something near to relief
at that, even if they were Shadowspawn; he would not have to use the axe. He drew the length of his
unstrung bow from under Stepper’s saddle girths. “Maybe this will do some good.”
“Try if you wish, blacksmith,” Lan said. “They do not die easily. Perhaps you will kill one.”
Perrin drew a fresh bowstring from his pouch, trying to shield it from the soft rain. The beeswax
coating was thin, and not much protection against prolonged damp. Setting the bow slantwise between
his legs, he bent it easily, fixing the loops of the bowstring into the horn nocks at the ends of the bow.
When he straightened, he could see the Darkhounds.
They ran like horses at a gallop, and as he caught sight of them, they gathered speed. They were
only ten large shapes running in the night, sweeping through the scattered trees, yet he pulled a
broadhead arrow from his quiver, nocked it but did not draw. He had been far from the best bowman
in Emond’s Field, but among the younger men, only Rand had been better.
At three hundred paces he would shoot, he decided. Fool! You’d have a hard time hitting a
target standing still at that distance. But if I wait, the way they are moving. . . . Stepping up beside
Moiraine, he raised his bow—I just have to imagine that moving shadow is a big dog—drew the
goose-feather fletchings to his ear, and loosed. He was sure the shaft merged with the nearest shadow,
but the only result was a snarl. It is not going to work. They’re coming too fast! He was already
drawing another arrow. Why aren’t you doing something, Moiraine? He could see their eyes,
shining like silver, their teeth gleaming like burnished steel. Black as the night itself and as big as
small ponies, they sped toward him, silent now, seeking the kill. The wind carried a stink near to
burned sulphur; the horses whickered fearfully, even Lan’s warhorse. Burn you, Aes Sedai, do
something! He loosed again; the frontmost Darkhound faltered and came on. They can die! He shot
once more, and the lead Darkhound tumbled, staggered to its feet, then fell, yet even as it did he knew
a moment of despair. One down, and the other nine had covered two thirds of the distance already;
they seemed to be running even faster, like shadows flowing across the ground. One more arrow.
Time for one more, maybe, and then it’s the axe. Burn you, Aes Sedai! He drew again.
“Now,” Moiraine said as his arrow left the bow. The air between her hands caught fire and
streaked toward the Darkhounds, vanquishing night. The horses squealed and leaped against being
held.

Perrin threw an arm across his eyes to shield them from a white-hot glare like burning, heat like
a forge cracking open; sudden noon flared in the darkness, and was gone. When he uncovered his
eyes, spots flickered across his vision, and the faint, fading image of that line of fire. Where the
Darkhounds had been was nothing but night-covered ground and the soft rain; the only shadows that
moved were cast by clouds crossing the moon.
I thought she’d throw fire at them, or call lightning, but this. . . . “What was that?” he asked
hoarsely.
Moiraine was peering off toward Illian again, as if she could see through all those miles of
darkness. “Perhaps he did not see,” she said, almost to herself. “It is far, and if he was not watching,
perhaps he did not notice.”
“Who?” Zarine demanded. “Sammael?” Her voice shook a little. “You said he was in Illian.
How could he see anything here? What did you do?”
“Something forbidden,” Moiraine said coolly. “Forbidden by vows almost as strong as the
Three Oaths.” She took Aldieb’s reins from the girl, and patted the mare’s neck, calming her.
“Something not used in nearly two thousand years. Something I might be stilled just for knowing.”
“Perhaps . . . ?” Loial’s voice was a faint boom. “Perhaps we should be going? There could be
more.”
“I think not,” the Aes Sedai said, mounting. “He would not loose two packs at once, even if he
has two; they would turn on each other instead of their prey. And I think we are not his main quarry,
or he would have come himself. We were . . . an annoyance, I think”—her tone was calm, but it was
clear she did not like being regarded so lightly—“and perhaps a little something extra to slip into his
gamebag, if we were not too much trouble. Still, there is small good in remaining any nearer him than
we must.”
“Rand?” Perrin asked. He could almost feel Zarine leaning forward to listen. “If we are not what
he hunts, is it Rand?”
“Perhaps,” Moiraine said. “Or perhaps Mat. Remember that he ista’veren also, and he blew the
Horn of Valere.”
Zarine made a strangled sound. “He blew it? Someone has found it already?”
The Aes Sedai ignored her, leaning out of her saddle to stare closely into Perrin’s eyes, dark
gleaming into burnished gold. “Once again events outpace me. I do not like that. And neither should
you. If events outrun me, they may well trample you, and the rest of the world with you.”
“We have many leagues to Tear yet,” Lan said. “The Ogier’s suggestion is a good one.” He was
already in his saddle.
After a moment Moiraine straightened and touched the mare’s ribs with her heels. She was
halfway down the side of the mound before he could get his bow unstrung and take Stepper’s reins
from Loial. Burn you, Moiraine! I’ll find some answers somewhere!
Leaning back against a fallen log, Mat enjoyed the warmth of the campfire—the rains had drifted
south three days earlier, but he still felt damp—yet right at that moment, he was hardly aware of the
dancing flames. He peered thoughtfully at the small, wax-covered cylinder in his hand. Thom was
engrossed in tuning his harp, muttering to himself of rain and wet, never glancing Mat’s way. Crickets
chirped in the dark thicket around them. Caught between villages by sunset, they had chosen this
copse away from the road. Two nights they had tried to buy a room for the night; twice a farmer had
loosed his dogs on them.
Mat unsheathed his belt knife, and hesitated. Luck. It only explodes sometimes, she said. Luck.

As carefully as he could, he slit along the length of the tube. It was a tube, and of paper, as he had
thought—he had found bits of paper on the ground after fireworks were set off, back home—layers of
paper, but all that filled the inside was something that looked like dirt, or maybe tiny gray-black
pebbles and dust. He stirred them on his palm with one finger. How in the Light could pebbles
explode?
“The Light burn me!” Thom roared. He thrust his harp into its case as if to protect it from what
was in Mat’s hand. “Are you trying to kill us, boy? Haven’t you ever heard those things explode ten
times as hard for air as for fire? Fireworks are the next thing to Aes Sedai work, boy.”
“Maybe,” Mat said, “but Aludra did not look like any Aes Sedai to me. I used to think that about
Master al’Vere’s clock—that it had to be Aes Sedai work—but once I got the back of the cabinet
open, I saw it was full of little pieces of metal.” He shifted uncomfortably at the memory. Mistress
al’Vere had been the first to reach him that time, with the Wisdom and his father and the Mayor all
right behind her, and none believing he just meant to look. I could have put them all back together. “I
think Perrin could make one, if he saw those little wheels and springs and I don’t know what all.”
“You would be surprised, boy,” Thom said dryly. “Even a bad clockmaker is a fairly rich man,
and they earn it. But a clock does not explode in your face!”
“Neither did this. Well, it is useless, now.” He tossed the handful of paper and little pebbles into
the fire to a screech from Thom; the pebbles sparked and made tiny flashes, and there was a smell of
acrid smoke.
“You are trying to kill us.” Thom’s voice was unsteady, and it rose in intensity and pitch as he
spoke. “If I decide I want to die, I will go to the Royal Palace when we reach Caemlyn, and I’ll pinch
Morgase!” His long mustaches flailed. “Do not do that again!”
“It did not explode,” Mat said, frowning at the fire. He fished into the oiled-cloth roll on the
other side of the log and pulled out a firework of the next larger size. “I wonder why there was no
bang.”
“I do not care why there was no bang! Do not do it again!”
Mat glanced at him and laughed. “Stop shaking, Thom. There’s no need to be afraid. I know what
is inside them, now. At least, I know what it looks like, but. . . . Don’t say it. I will not be cutting any
more open, Thom. It is more fun to set them off, anyway.”
“I am not afraid, you mud-footed swineherd,” Thom said with elaborate dignity. “I am shaking
with rage because I’m traveling with a goat-brained lout who might kill the pair of us because he
cannot think past his own—”
“Ho, the fire!”
Mat exchanged glances with Thom as horses’ hooves approached. It was late for anyone honest
to be traveling. But the Queen’s Guards kept the roads safe this close to Caemlyn, and the four who
rode into the firelight certainly did not look like robbers. One was a woman. The men all wore long
cloaks and seemed to be her retainers, while she was pretty and blue-eyed, in gold necklace and a
gray silk dress and a velvet cloak with a wide hood. The men dismounted. One held her reins and
another her stirrup, and she smiled at Mat, doffing her gloves as she came near the fire.
“I fear we are caught out late, young master,” she said, “and I would trouble you for directions to
an inn, if you know one.”
He grinned and started to rise. He had made it as far as a crouch when he heard one of the men
mutter something, and another produced a crossbow from under his cloak, already drawn, with a clip
holding the bolt.
“Kill him, fool!” the woman shouted, and Mat tossed the firework into the flames and threw

himself toward his quarterstaff. There was a loud bang and a flash of light—“Aes Sedai!” a man
cried. “Fireworks, fool!” the woman shouted—and he rolled to his feet with the staff in his hand to
see the crossbow bolt sticking out of the fallen log almost where he had been sitting, and the
crossbowman falling with the hilt of one of Thom’s knives adorning his chest.
It was all he had time to see, for the other two men darted past the fire at him, drawing swords.
One of them suddenly stumbled to his knees, dropping his sword to claw at the knife in his back as he
fell facedown. The last man did not see his companion fall; he obviously expected to be one of a pair,
dividing their opponent’s attention, as he thrust his blade at Mat’s middle. Feeling almost
contemptuous, Mat cracked the fellow’s wrist with one end of his staff, sending the sword flying, and
cracked his forehead with the other. The man’s eyes rolled up in his head as he collapsed.
From the corner of his eye, Mat saw the woman walking toward him, and he stuck a finger at her
like a knife. “Fine clothes you wear for a thief, woman! You sit down till I decide what to do with
you, or I’ll—”
She looked as surprised as Mat at the knife that suddenly bloomed in her throat, a red flower of
spreading blood. He took a half step as if to catch her as she fell, knowing it was no good. Her long
cloak settled over her, covering everything but her face, and the hilt of Thom’s knife.
“Burn you,” Mat muttered. “Burn you, Thom Merrilin! A woman! Light, we could have tied her
up, given her to the Queen’s Guards tomorrow in Caemlyn. Light, I might even have let her go. She’d
rob nobody without these three, and the only one that lives will be days before he can see straight and
months before he can hold a sword. Burn you, Thom, there was no need to kill her!”
The gleeman limped to where the woman lay, and kicked back her cloak. The dagger had half
fallen from her hand, its blade as wide as Mat’s thumb and two hands long. “Would you rather I had
waited till she nested that in your ribs, boy?” He retrieved his own knife, wiping the blade on her
cloak.
Mat realized he was humming “She Wore a Mask That Hid Her Face,” and stopped it. He bent
down and hid hers with the hood of her cloak. “Best we move on,” he said quietly. “I do not want to
have to explain this if a patrol of the Guards happens by.”
“With her in those clothes?” Thom said. “I should say not! They must have robbed a merchant’s
wife, or some noblewoman’s carriage.” His voice became gentler. “If we’re going, boy, you had best
see to saddling your horse.”
Mat gave a start and pulled his eyes from the dead woman. “Yes, I had better, hadn’t I?” He did
not look at her again.
He had no such compunction about the men. As far as he was concerned, a man who decided to
rob and kill deserved what he got when he lost the game. He did not dwell on them, but neither did he
jerk his eyes away if they fell on one of the robbers. It was after he had saddled his gelding and tied
his things on behind, while he was kicking dirt onto the fire, that he found himself looking at the man
who had shot the crossbow. There was something familiar about those features, about the way the
smothering fire made shadows across them. Luck, he told himself. Always the luck.
“The crossbowman was a good swimmer, Thom,” he said as he climbed into the saddle.
“What foolery are you talking, now?” The gleeman was on his horse, too, and far more
concerned with how his instrument cases rode behind his saddle than he was with the dead. “How
could you know whether he could even swim at all?”
“He made it ashore from a small boat in the middle of the Erinin in the middle of the night. I
guess that used up all his luck.” He checked the lashings on the roll of fireworks again. If that fool
thought one of these was Aes Sedai, I wonder what he’d have thought if they all went off.

“Are you sure, boy? The chances of it being the same man. . . . Why, even you wouldn’t lay a
wager against those odds.”
“I am sure, Thom.” Elayne, I will wring your neck when I put my hands on you. And Egwene’s
and Nynaeve’s, too. “And I am sure I intend to have this bloody letter out of my hands an hour after
we reach Caemlyn.”
“I tell you, there is nothing in that letter, boy. I played Daes Dae’mar when I was younger than
you, and I can recognize a code or a cipher even when I don’t know what it says.”
“Well, I never played your Great Game, Thom, your bloody Game of Houses, but I know when
someone is chasing me, and they’d not be chasing this hard or this far for the gold in my pockets, not
for less than a chest full of gold. It has to be the letter.” Burn me, pretty girls always get me in
trouble. “Do you feel like sleeping tonight, after this?”
“With the sleep of an innocent babe, boy. But if you want to ride, I’ll ride.”
The face of a pretty woman floated into Mat’s head, with a dagger in her throat. You had no
luck, pretty woman. “Then let’s ride!” he said savagely.

CHAPTER
45

Caemlyn

Mat had vague memories of Caemlyn, but when they approached it in the early hours after
sunrise, it seemed as if he had never been there before. They had not been alone on the road since
first light, and other riders surrounded them now, and trains of merchants’ wagons and folk afoot, all
streaming toward the great city.
Built on rising hills, it was surely as large as Tar Valon, and outside the huge walls—a fifty-foot
height of pale, grayish stone streaked with white and silver sparkling in the sun, spaced with tall,
round towers with the Lion Banner of Andor waving atop them, white on red—outside those walls, it
seemed as if another great city had been placed, wrapping around the walled city, all red brick and
gray stone and white plastered walls, inns pushed in on houses of three and four stories so fine they
must belong to wealthy merchants, shops with goods displayed on tables under awnings crowding
against wide, windowless warehouses. Open markets under red and purple roof tiles lined the road
on both sides, men and women already crying their wares, bargaining at the top of their voices, while
penned calves and sheep and goats and pigs, caged geese and chickens and ducks, added to the din.
He seemed to remember thinking Caemlyn was too noisy when he was here before; now it sounded
like a heartbeat, pumping wealth.
The road led to arched gates twenty feet high, standing open under the watchful eye of redcoated Queen’s Guards in their shining breastplates—they eyed Thom and him no more than anyone
else, not even the quarterstaff slanted across his saddle in front of him; all they cared was that people
keep moving, it seemed—and then they were within. Slender towers here rose even taller than those
along the walls, and gleaming domes shone white and gold above streets teeming with people. Just
inside the gates the road split into two parallel streets, separated by a wide strip of grass and trees.
The hills of the city rose like steps toward a peak, which was surrounded by another wall, shining as
white as Tar Valon’s, with still more domes and towers within. That was the Inner City, Mat
recalled, and atop those highest hills stood the Royal Palace.
“No point waiting,” he told Thom. “I’ll take the letter straight on.” He looked at the sedan chairs
and carriages making their way through the crowds, the shops with all their goods displayed. “A man
could earn some gold in this city, Thom, once he found a game of dice, or cards.” He was not quite so
lucky at cards as at dice, but few except nobles and the wealthy played those games anyway. Now
that’s who I should find a game with.
Thom yawned at him and hitched at his gleeman’s cloak as if it were a blanket. “We have ridden
all night, boy. Let’s at least find something to eat, first. The Queen’s Blessing has good meals.” He
yawned again. “And good beds.”
“I remember that,” Mat said slowly. He did, in a way. The innkeeper was a fat man with graying
hair, Master Gill. Moiraine had caught up to Rand and him there, when he had thought they were

finally free of her. She’s off playing her game with Rand, now. Nothing to do with me. Not anymore.
“I will meet you there, Thom. I said I’d have this letter out of my hands an hour after I arrived, and I
mean to. You go on.”
Thom nodded and turned his horse aside, calling over his shoulder through a yawn. “Do not
become lost, boy. It’s a big city, Caemlyn.”
And a rich one. Mat heeled his mount on up the crowded street. Lost! I can find my bloody way.
The sickness appeared to have erased parts of his memory. He could look at an inn, its upper floors
sticking out over the ground floor all the way around and its sign creaking in the breeze, and
remember seeing it before, yet not recall another thing he could see from that spot. A hundred paces
of street might abruptly spark in his memory, while the parts before and after remained as mysterious
as dice still in the cup.
Even with the holes in his memory he was sure he had never been to the Inner City or the Royal
Palace—I couldn’t forget that!—yet he did not need to remember the way. The streets of the New
City—he remembered that name suddenly; it was the part of Caemlyn less than two thousand years
old—ran every which way, but the main boulevards all led to the Inner City. The Guards at the gates
made no effort to stop anyone.
Within those white walls were buildings that could almost have fit in Tar Valon. The curving
streets topped hills to reveal thin towers, their tiled walls sparkling with a hundred colors in the
sunlight, or to look down on parks laid out in patterns made to be viewed from above, or to show
sweeping vistas across the entire city to the rolling plains and forests beyond. It did not really matter
which streets he took here. They all spiraled in on what he sought, the Royal Palace of Andor.
In no time, he found himself crossing the huge oval plaza before the Palace, riding toward its
tall, gilded gates. The pure white Palace of Andor would certainly not have been out of place among
Tar Valon’s wonders, with its slender towers and golden domes shining in the sun, its high balconies
and intricate stonework. The gold leaf on one of those domes could have kept him in luxury for a year.
There were fewer people in the plaza than elsewhere, as if it were reserved for great occasions.
A dozen of the Guards stood before the closed gates, bows slanted, all at exactly the same angle,
across their gleaming breastplates, faces hidden by the steel bars of their burnished helmets’ faceguards. A heavyset officer, with his red cloak thrown back to reveal a knot of gold braid on his
shoulder, was walking up and down the line, eyeing each man as if he thought he might find rust or
dust.
Mat drew rein and put on a smile. “Good morning to you, Captain.”
The officer turned, staring at him through the bars of his face-guard with deep, beady eyes, like a
pudgy rat in a cage. The man was older than he had expected—surely old enough to have more than
one knot of rank—and fat rather than stocky. “What do you want, farmer?” he demanded roughly.
Mat drew a breath. Make it good. Impress this fool so he doesn’t keep me waiting all day. I
don’t want to have to flash the Amyrlin’s paper around to keep from kicking my heels . “I come
from Tar Valon, from the White Tower, bearing a letter from—”
“You come from Tar Valon, farmer?” The fat officer’s stomach shook as he laughed, but then his
laughter cut off as if severed with a knife, and he glared. “We want no letters from Tar Valon, rogue,
if you have such a thing! Our good Queen—may the Light illumine her!—will take no word from the
White Tower until the Daughter-Heir is returned to her. I never heard of any messenger from the
Tower wearing a countryman’s coat and breeches. It is plain to me you are up to some trick, perhaps
thinking you’ll find a few coins if you come claiming to carry letters, but you will be lucky if you
don’t end in a prison cell! If you do come from Tar Valon, go back and tell the Tower to return the

Daughter-Heir before we come and take her! If you’re a trickster after silver, get out of my sight
before I have you beaten within an inch of your life! Either way, you half-wit looby, be gone!”
Mat had been trying to edge a word in from the beginning of the man’s speech. He said quickly,
“The letter is from her, man. It is from—”
“Did I not tell you to be gone, ruffian?” the fat man bellowed. His face was growing nearly as
red as his coat. “Take yourself out of my sight, you gutter scum! If you are not gone by the time I count
ten, I will arrest you for littering the plaza with your presence! One! Two!”
“Can you count so high, you fat fool?” Mat snapped. “I tell you, Elayne sent—”
“Guards!” The officer’s face was purple now. “Seize this man for a Darkfriend!”
Mat hesitated a moment, sure no one could take such a charge seriously, but the red-coated
Guards dashed toward him, all dozen men in breastplates and helmets, and he wheeled his horse and
galloped ahead of them, followed by the fat man’s shouts. The gelding was no racer, but it
outdistanced men afoot easily enough. People dodged out of his way along the curving streets, shaking
fists after him and shouting as many curses as the officer had.
Fool, he thought, meaning the fat officer, then added another for himself. All I had to do was say
her bloody name in the beginning. “Elayne, the Daughter-Heir of Andor, sends this letter to her
mother, Queen Morgase.” Light, who could have thought they’d think that way about Tar Valon.
From what he remembered of his last visit, Aes Sedai and the White Tower had been close behind
Queen Morgase in the Guards’ affections. Burn her, Elayne could have told me. Reluctantly, he
added, I could have asked questions, too.
Before he reached the arched gates that let out into the New City, he slowed to a walk. He did
not think the Guards from the Palace could still be chasing him, and there was no point in attracting
the eyes of those at the gate by galloping through, but they looked at him no more now than when he
had first entered.
As he rode under the broad arch, he smiled and almost turned back. He had suddenly
remembered something, and had an idea that appealed to him a good deal more than walking through
the Palace gates. Even if that fat officer had not been watching the gates, he thought he would like it
better.
He became lost twice while searching for The Queen’s Blessing, but at last he found the sign
with a man kneeling before a woman with red-gold hair and a crown of golden roses, her hand on his
head. It was a broad stone building of three stories, with tall windows even up under the red roof
tiles. He rode around back to the stableyard, where a horse-faced fellow, in a leather vest that could
hardly be any tougher than his skin, took his horse’s reins. He thought he remembered the fellow. Yes.
Ramey.
“It has been a long time, Ramey.” Mat tossed him a silver mark. “You remember me, don’t you?”
“Can’t say as I . . .” Ramey began, then caught the shine of silver where he had expected copper;
he coughed, and his short nod turned into something that combined a knuckled forehead with a jerky
bow. “Why, of course I do, young master. Forgive me. Slipped my mind. Mind no good for people.
Good for horses. I know horses, I do. A fine animal, young master. I’ll take good care of him, you can
be sure.” He delivered it all quickly, with no room for Mat to say a word, then hurried the gelding
into the stable before he might have to come up with Mat’s name.
With a sour grimace, Mat put the fat roll of fireworks under his arm and shouldered the rest of
his belongings. Fellow couldn’t tell me from Hawkwing’s toenails . A bulky, muscular man was
sitting on an upturned barrel beside the door to the kitchen, gently scratching the ear of a black-andwhite cat crouched on his knee. The man studied Mat with heavy-lidded eyes, especially the

quarterstaff across his shoulder, but he never stopped his scratching. Mat thought he remembered him,
but he could not bring up a name. He said nothing as he went through the door, and neither did the
man. No reason they should remember me. Probably have bloody Aes Sedai coming for people
every day.
In the kitchen, two undercooks and three scullions were darting between stoves and roasting
spits under the direction of a round woman with her hair in a bun and a long wooden spoon that she
used to point out what she wanted done. Mat was sure he remembered the round woman. Coline, and
what a name for a woman that wide, but everybody called her Cook.
“Well, Cook,” he announced, “I am back, and not a year since I left.”
She peered at him a moment, then nodded. “I remember you.” He began to grin. “You were with
that young prince, weren’t you?” she went on. “The one who looked so like Tigraine, the Light
illumine her memory. You’re his serving man, aren’t you? Is he coming back, then, the young prince?”
“No,” he said curtly. A prince! Light! “I do not think he will be anytime soon, and I don’t think
you would like it if he did.” She protested, saying what a fine, handsome young man the prince was
—Burn me, is there a woman anywhere who doesn’t moon over Rand and make calf-eyes if you
mention his bloody name? She’d bloody scream if she knew what he is doing now—but he refused
to let her get it out. “Is Master Gill about? And Thom Merrilin?”
“In the library,” she said with a tight sniff. “You tell Basel Gill when you see him that I said
those drains need cleaning. Today, mind.” She caught sight of something one of the undercooks was
doing to a beef roast and waddled over to her. “Not so much, child. You will make the meat too
sweet if you put so much arrath on it.” She seemed to have forgotten Mat already.
He shook his head as he went in search of this library he could not remember. He could not
remember that Coline was married to Master Gill, either, but if he had ever heard a goodwife send
instructions to her husband, that had been it. A pretty serving girl with big eyes giggled and directed
him down a hall beside the common room.
When he stepped into the library, he stopped and stared. There had to be more than three
hundred books on the shelves built on the walls, and more lying on the tables; he had never seen so
many books in one place in his life. He noticed a leather-bound copy of The Travels of Jain
Farstrider on a table near the door. He had always meant to read that—Rand and Perrin had always
been telling him things out of it—but he never did seem to get around to reading the books he meant to
read.
Pink-faced Basel Gill and Thom Merrilin were seated at one of the tables, facing each other
across a stones board, pipes in their teeth trailing thin blue streamers of tabac smoke. A calico cat sat
on the table beside a wooden dice cup, her tail curled over her feet, watching them play. The
gleeman’s cloak was nowhere in sight, so Mat supposed he had already gotten a room.
“You’re done sooner than I expected, boy,” Thom said around his pipestem. He tugged one long,
white mustache as he considered where to place his next stone on the board’s cross-hatchings.
“Basel, you remember Mat Cauthon.”
“I remember,” the fat innkeeper said, peering at the board. “Sickly, the last time you were here, I
recall. I hope you are better now, lad.”
“I am better,” Mat said. “Is that all you remember? That I was sick?”
Master Gill winced at Thom’s move and took his pipe out of his mouth. “Considering who you
left with, lad, and considering the way things are now, maybe it’s best I remember no more than that.”
“Aes Sedai not in such good odor now, are they?” Mat set his things in one big armchair, the
quarterstaff propped against the back, and himself in another with one leg swinging over the arm.

“The Guards at the Palace seemed to think the White Tower had stolen Elayne.” Thom eyed the roll
of fireworks uneasily, looked at his smoking pipe, and muttered to himself before going back to his
study of the board.
“Hardly that,” Gill said, “but the whole city knows she disappeared from the Tower. Thom says
she’s returned, but we’ve heard none of that here. Perhaps Morgase knows, but everyone down to a
stableboy is stepping lightly so she doesn’t snap off his head. Lord Gaebril has kept her from actually
sending anyone to the headsman, but I’d not say she would not do it. And he has certainly not soothed
her temper toward Tar Valon. If anything, I think he has made it worse.”
“Morgase has a new advisor,” Thom said in a dry voice. “Gareth Bryne did not like him, so
Bryne has been retired to his estate to watch his sheep grow wool. Basel, are you going to place a
stone or not?”
“In a moment, Thom. In a moment. I want to set it right.” Gill clamped his teeth around his
pipestem and frowned at the board, puffing up smoke.
“So the Queen has an advisor who doesn’t like Tar Valon,” Mat said. “Well, that explains the
way the Guards acted when I said I came from there.”
“If you told them that,” Gill said, “you might be lucky you escaped without any broken bones. If
it was any of the new men, at least. Gaebril has replaced half the Guards in Caemlyn with men of his
choosing, and that is no mean feat considering how short a time he has been here. Some say Morgase
may marry him.” He started to put a stone on the board, then took it back with a shake of his head.
“Times change. People change. Too much change for me. I suppose I am growing old.”
“You seem to mean us both to grow old before you place a stone,” Thom muttered. The cat
stretched and slinked across the table for him to stroke her back. “Talking all day will not let you find
a good move. Why don’t you just admit defeat, Basel?”
“I never admit defeat,” Gill said stoutly. “I’ll beat you yet, Thom.” He set a white stone on the
intersection of two lines. “You will see.” Thom snorted.
From what Mat could see of the board, he did not think Gill had much chance. “I will just have
to avoid the Guards and put Elayne’s letter right into Morgase’s hands.” Especially if they’re all like
that fat fool. Light, I wonder if he’s told them all I’m a Darkfriend?
“You did not deliver it?” Thom barked. “I thought you were anxious to be rid of the thing.”
“You have a letter from the Daughter-Heir?” Gill exclaimed. “Thom, why did you not tell me?”
“I am sorry, Basel,” the gleeman muttered. He glared at Mat from under those bushy eyebrows
and blew out his mustaches. “The boy thinks someone is out to kill him over it, so I thought I’d let him
say what he wanted and no more. Seems he does not care any longer.”
“What kind of letter?” Gill asked. “Is she coming home? And Lord Gawyn? I hope they are. I’ve
actually heard talk of war with Tar Valon, as if anyone could be fool enough to go to war with Aes
Sedai. If you ask me, it is all one with those mad rumors we’ve heard about Aes Sedai supporting a
false Dragon somewhere in the west, and using the Power as a weapon. Not that I can see why that
would make anyone want to go to war with them; just the opposite.”
“Are you married to Coline?” Mat asked, and Master Gill gave a start.
“The Light preserve me from that! You would think the inn was hers now. If she was my wife . . .
! What does that have to do with the Daughter-Heir’s letter?”
“Nothing,” Mat said, “but you went on so long, I thought you must have forgotten your own
questions.” Gill made a choking sound, and Thom barked a laugh. Mat hurried on before the
innkeeper could speak. “The letter is sealed; Elayne did not tell me what it says.” Thom was eyeing
him sideways and stroking his mustaches. Does he think I’ll admit we opened the thing? “But I don’t

think she is coming home. She means to be Aes Sedai, if you ask me.” He told them about his attempt
to deliver the letter, smoothing over a few edges they had no need to know about.
“The new men,” Gill said. “That officer sounds it, at least. I’ll wager on it. No better than
brigands, most of them, except the ones with a sly eye. You wait until this afternoon, lad, when the
Guards on the gate will have changed. Say the Daughter-Heir’s name right out, and just in case the
new fellow is one of Gaebril’s men, too, duck your head a little. A knuckle to your forehead, and
you’ll have no trouble.”
“Burn me if I will. I pull wool and scratch gravel for nobody. Not to Morgase herself. This time,
I’ll not go near the Guards at all.” I would just as soon not know what word that fat fellow has
spread. They stared at him as if he were mad.
“How under the Light,” Gill said, “do you mean to enter the Royal Palace without passing the
Guards?” His eyes widened as if he were remembering something. “Light, you don’t mean to. . . .
Lad, you’d need the Dark One’s own luck to escape with your life!”
“What are you going on about now, Basel? Mat, what fool thing do you intend to try?”
“I am lucky, Master Gill,” Mat said. “You just have a good meal waiting when I come back.” As
he stood, he picked up the dice cup and spun the dice out beside the stones board for luck. The calico
cat leaped down, hissing at him with her back arched. The five spotted dice came to rest, each
showing a single pip. The Dark One’s Eyes.
“That’s the best toss or the worst,” Gill said. “It depends on the game you are playing, doesn’t it.
Lad, I think you mean to play a dangerous game. Why don’t you take that cup out into the common
room and lose a few coppers? You look to me like a fellow who might like a little gamble. I will see
the letter gets to the Palace safely.”
“Coline wants you to clean the drains,” Mat told him, and turned to Thom while the innkeeper
was still blinking and muttering to himself. “It doesn’t seem to make any odds whether I get an arrow
in me trying to deliver that letter or a knife in my back waiting. It’s six up, and a half dozen down. Just
you have that meal waiting, Thom.” He tossed a gold mark on the table in front of Gill. “Have my
things put in a room, innkeeper. If it takes more coin, you will have it. Be careful of the big roll; it
frightens Thom something awful.”
As he stalked out, he heard Gill say to Thom, “I always thought that lad was a rascal. How does
he come by gold?”
I always win, that’s how, he thought grimly. I just have to win once more, and I’m done with
Elayne, and that’s the last of the White Tower for me. Just once more.

CHAPTER
46

A Message Out of the Shadow

Even as he returned to the Inner City on foot, Mat was far from certain that what he intended
would actually work. It would, if what he had been told was true, but it was the truth of that he was
not sure of. He avoided the oval plaza in front of the Palace, but wandered around the sides of the
huge structure and its grounds, along streets that curved with the contours of the hills. The golden
domes of the Palace glittered, mockingly out of reach. He had made his way almost all the way
around, nearly back to the plaza, when he saw it. A steep slope thick with low flowers, rising from
the street to a white wall of rough stone. Several leafy tree limbs stuck over the top of the wall, and
he could see the tops of others beyond, in a garden of the Royal Palace.
A wall made to look like a cliff, he thought, and a garden on the other side. Maybe Rand was
telling the truth.
A casual look both ways showed him he had the curving street to himself for the moment. He
would have to hurry; the curves did not allow him to see very far; someone could come along any
moment. He scrambled up the slope on all fours, careless of how his boots ripped holes in the banks
of red and white blossoms. The rough stone of the wall gave plenty of fingerholds, and ridges and
knobs provided toeholds even for a man in boots.
Careless of them to make it so easy, he thought as he climbed. For a moment the climbing took
him back home with Rand and Perrin, to a journey they had made beyond the Sand Hills, into the edge
of the Mountains of Mist. When they returned to Emond’s Field, they had all caught the fury from
everyone who could lay hands on them—him worst of all; everyone assumed it had been his idea—
but for three days they had climbed the cliffs, and slept under the sky, and eaten eggs filched from
redcrests’ nests, and plump, gray-winged grouse fetched with an arrow, or a stone from a sling, and
rabbits caught with snares, all the while laughing about how they were not afraid of the mountains’
bad luck and how they might find a treasure. He had brought home an odd rock from that expedition,
with the skull of a good-sized fish somehow pressed into it, and a long, white tail feather dropped by
a snow eagle, and a piece of white stone as big as his hand that looked almost as if it had been carved
into a man’s ear. He thought it looked like an ear, even if Rand and Perrin did not, and Tam al’Thor
had said it might be.
His fingers slipped out of a shallow groove, his balance shifted and he lost the toehold under his
left foot. With a gasp, he barely caught hold of the top of the wall, and pulled himself up the rest of the
way. For a moment he lay there, breathing hard. It would not have been that long a fall, but enough to
break his head. Fool, letting my mind wander like that. Nearly killed myself on those cliffs that
way. That was all a long time ago. His mother had likely thrown all those things out already,
anyway. With one last look each way to make sure no one had seen him—the curving length of street
below was still empty—he dropped inside the Palace grounds.

It was a large garden, with flagstoned walks through expanses of grass among the trees, and
grapevines thick on arbors over the walks. And everywhere, flowers. White blossoms covering the
pear trees, and white and pink dotting the apple trees. Roses in every color, and bright golden
sunburst, and purple Emond’s Glory, and many he could not identify. Some he was not sure could be
real. One had odd blossoms in scarlet and gold that looked almost like birds, and another seemed no
different from a sunflower except that its yellow flowers were two feet and more across and stood on
stalks as tall as an Ogier.
Boots crunched on flagstone, and he crouched low behind a bush against the wall as two
guardsmen marched past, their long, white collars hanging over their breastplates. They never glanced
his way, and he grinned to himself. Luck. With just a little luck, they’ll never see me till I hand the
bloody thing to Morgase.
He slipped through the garden like a shadow, as if stalking rabbits, freezing by a bush or hard
against a tree trunk when he heard boots. Two more pairs of soldiers strode by along the paths, the
second close enough for him to have taken two steps and goosed them. As they vanished among the
flowers and trees, he plucked a deep red starblaze and stuck the wavy-petaled flower in his hair with
a grin. This was as much fun as stealing applecakes at Sunday, and easier. Women always kept a
sharp watch on their baking; the fool soldiers never took their eyes off the flagstones.
It was not long before he found himself against the white wall of the Palace itself, and began
sliding along it behind a row of flowering white roses on slatted frames, searching for a door. There
were plenty of wide, arched windows just over his head, but he thought it might be a bit harder to
explain being found climbing in through a window than walking down a hall. Two more soldiers
appeared, and he froze; they would pass within three paces of him. He could hear voices from the
window over his head, two men, just loud enough for him to make out the words.
“—on their way to Tear, Great Master.” The man sounded frightened and obsequious.
“Let them ruin his plans, if they can.” This voice was deeper and stronger, a man used to
command. “It will serve him right if three untrained girls can foil him. He was always a fool, and he
is still a fool. Is there any word of the boy? He is the one who can destroy us all.”
“No, Great Master. He has vanished. But, Great Master, one of the girls is Morgase’s nit.”
Mat half turned, then caught himself. The soldiers were coming closer; they did not appear to
have seen his start through the thickly woven rose stems. Move, you fools! Get by so I can see who
this man bloody is! He had lost some of the conversation.
“—has been far too impatient since regaining his freedom,” the deep voice was saying. “He
never realized the best plans take time to mature. He wants the world in a day, and Callandor
besides. The Great Lord take him! He may seize the girl and try to make some use of her. And that
might strain my own plans.”
“As you say, Great Master. Shall I order her brought out of Tear?”
“No. The fool would take it as a move against him, if he knew. And who can say what he
chooses to watch aside from the sword? See that she dies quietly, Comar. Let her death attract no
notice at all.” His laughter was a rich rumble. “Those ignorant slatterns in their Tower will have a
difficult time producing her after this disappearance. This may all be just as well. Let it be done
quickly. Quickly, before he has time to take her himself.”
The two soldiers were almost abreast of him; Mat tried to will their feet to move faster.
“Great Master,” the other man said uncertainly, “that may be difficult. We know she is on her
way to Tear, but the vessel she traveled on was found at Aringill, and all three of them had left it
earlier. We do not know whether she has taken another ship, or is riding south. And it may not be easy

to find her once she reaches Tear, Great Master. Perhaps if you—”
“Are there none but fools in the world, now?” the deep voice said harshly. “Do you think I could
move in Tear without him knowing? I do not mean to fight him, not now, not yet. Bring me the girl’s
head, Comar. Bring me all three heads, or you will pray for me to take yours!”
“Yes, Great Master. It shall be as you say. Yes. Yes.”
The soldiers crunched past, never looking to either side. Mat only waited for their backs to pass
before leaping up to catch the broad stone windowsill and pull himself high enough to see through the
window.
He barely noticed the fringed Tarabon carpet on the floor, worth a fat purse of silver. One of the
broad, carved doors was swinging shut. A tall man, with wide shoulders and a deep chest straining
the green silk of his silver-embroidered coat, was staring at the door with dark blue eyes. His black
beard was close cut, with a streak of white over his chin. All in all, he looked a hard man, and one
used to giving orders.
“Yes, Great Master,” he said suddenly, and Mat almost lost his grip on the sill. He had thought
this must be the man with the deep voice, but it was the cringing voice he heard. Not cringing now,
but still the same. “It shall be as you say, Great Master,” the man said bitterly. “I will cut the three
wenches’ heads off myself. As soon as I can find them!” He strode through the door, and Mat let
himself back down.
For a moment he crouched there behind the rose frames. Someone in the Palace wanted Elayne
dead, and had thrown in Egwene and Nynaeve as afterthoughts. What under the Light are they doing,
going to Tear? It had to be them.
He pulled the Daughter-Heir’s letter out of the lining of his coat and frowned at it. Maybe, with
this in his hand, Morgase would believe him. He could describe one of the men. But the time for
skulking was past; the big fellow could be off to Tear before he even found Morgase, and whatever
she did then, there was no guarantee it could stop him.
Taking a deep breath, Mat wiggled between two of the rose frames at the cost of only a few
pricks and snags from the thorns, and started down the flagstone path after the soldiers. He held
Elayne’s letter out in front of him so the golden lily seal was plainly visible, and went over in his
mind exactly what he meant to say. When he had been sneaking about, guardsmen kept popping up like
mushrooms after rain, but now he walked almost the length of the garden without seeing even one. He
passed several doors. It would not be so good to enter the Palace without permission—the Guards
might do nasty things first and listen after—but he was beginning to think about going through a door
when it opened and a helmetless young officer with one golden knot on his shoulder strode out.
The man’s hand immediately went to his sword hilt, and he had a foot of steel bared before Mat
could push the letter toward him. “Elayne, the Daughter-Heir, sends this letter to her mother, Queen
Morgase, Captain.” He held the letter so the lily seal was prominent.
The officer’s dark eyes flickered to either side, as if searching for other people, without really
ever leaving Mat. “How did you come into this garden?” He did not draw his sword further, but he
did not sheath it, either. “Elber is on the main gates. He’s a fool, but he would never let anyone
wander loose into the Palace.”
“A fat man with eyes like a rat?” Mat cursed his tongue, but the officer gave a sharp nod; he
almost smiled, too, but it did not seem to lessen his vigilance, or his suspicion. “He grew angry when
he learned I had come from Tar Valon, and he wouldn’t even give me a chance to show the letter or
mention the Daughter-Heir’s name. He said he would arrest me if I did not go, so I climbed the wall. I
promised I would deliver this to Queen Morgase herself, you see, Captain. I promised it, and I

always keep my promises. You see the seal?”
“That bloody garden wall again,” the officer muttered. “It should be built three times so high.”
He eyed Mat. “Guardsman-lieutenant, not captain. I am Guardsman-lieutenant Tallanvor. I recognize
the Daughter-Heir’s seal.” His sword finally slid all the way back into the sheath. He stretched out a
hand; not his sword hand. “Give me the letter, and I will take it to the Queen. After I show you out.
Some would not be so gentle at finding you walking about loose.”
“I promised to put it in her hands myself,” Mat said. Light, I never thought they might not let
me give it to her. “I did promise. To the Daughter-Heir.”
Mat hardly realized Tallanvor’s hand was moving before the officer’s sword was resting against
his neck. “I will take you to the Queen, countryman,” Tallanvor said softly. “But know that I can take
your head before you blink if you so much as think of harming her.”
Mat put on his best grin. That slightly curved blade felt sharp on the side of his neck. “I am a
loyal Andorman,” he said, “and a faithful subject of the Queen, the Light illumine her. Why, if I had
been here during the winter, I’d have followed Lord Gaebril for sure.”
Tallanvor gave him a tight-mouthed stare, then finally took his sword away. Mat swallowed and
stopped himself from touching his throat to see if he had been cut.
“Take the flower out of your hair,” Tallanvor said as he sheathed his blade. “Do you think you
came here courting?”
Mat snatched the starblaze blossom out of his hair and followed the officer. Bloody fool, putting
a flower in my hair. I have to stop playing the fool, now.
It was not so much following, really, for Tallanvor kept an eye on him even while he led the
way. The result was an odd sort of procession, with the officer to one side of him and ahead, but half
turned in case Mat tried anything. For his part, Mat attempted to look as innocent as a babe splashing
in his bathwater.
The colorful tapestries on the walls had earned their weavers silver, and so had the rugs on the
white tile floors, even here in the halls. Gold and silver stood everywhere, plates and platters, bowls
and cups, on chests and low cabinets of polished wood, as fine as anything he had seen in the Tower.
Servants darted everywhere, in red livery with white collars and cuffs and the White Lion of Andor
on their breasts. He found himself wondering if Morgase played at dice. Wool-headed thought.
Queens don’t toss dice. But when I give her this letter and tell her somebody in her Palace means
to kill Elayne, I’ll wager she gives me a fat purse. He indulged himself in a small fancy of being
made a lord; surely the man who revealed a plot to murder the Daughter-Heir could expect some such
reward.
Tallanvor led him down so many corridors and across so many courtyards that he was beginning
to wonder if he could find his way out again without help, when suddenly one of the courts had more
than servants in it. A columned walk surrounded the court, with a round pool in the middle with white
and yellow fish swimming beneath lily pads and floating white water lilies. Men in colorful coats
embroidered in gold or silver, women with wide dresses worked even more elaborately, stood
attendance on a woman with red-gold hair who sat on the raised rim of the pool, trailing her fingers in
the water and staring sadly at the fish that rose to her fingertips in hopes of food. A Great Serpent ring
encircled the third finger of her left hand. A tall, dark man stood at her shoulder, the red silk of his
coat almost hidden by the gold leaves and scrolls worked on it, but it was the woman who held Mat’s
eye.
He did not need the wreath of finely made golden roses in her hair, or the stole hanging over her
dress of white slashed with red, the red length of the stole embroidered with the Lions of Andor, to

know he was looking at Morgase, by the Grace of the Light, Queen of Andor, Defender of the Realm,
Protector of the People, High Seat of House Trakand. She had Elayne’s face and beauty, but it was
what Elayne would have when she had ripened. Every other woman in the courtyard faded into the
background by her very presence.
I’d dance a jig with her, and steal a kiss in the moonlight, too, no matter how old she is. He
shook himself. Remember exactly who she is!
Tallanvor went to one knee, a fist pressed to the white stone of the courtyard. “My Queen, I
bring a messenger who bears a letter from the Lady Elayne.”
Mat eyed the man’s posture, then contented himself with a deep bow. “From the Daughter-Heir
. . . uh . . . my Queen.” He held out the letter as he bowed, so the golden yellow wax of the seal was
visible. Once she reads it, and knows Elayne is all right, I will tell her. Morgase turned her deep
blue eyes on him. Light! As soon as she’s in a good mood.
“You bring a letter from my scapegrace child?” Her voice was cold, but with an edge that spoke
of heat ready to rise. “That must mean she is alive, at least! Where is she?”
“In Tar Valon, my Queen,” he managed to get out. Light, wouldn’t I like to see a staring match
between her and the Amyrlin. On second thought, he decided he would rather not. “At least, she was
when I left.”
Morgase waved a hand impatiently, and Tallanvor rose to take the letter from Mat and hand it to
her. For a moment she frowned at the lily seal, then broke it with a sharp twist of her wrists. She
murmured to herself as she read, shaking her head at every other line. “She can say no more, can
she?” she muttered. “We shall see whether she holds to that. . . .”Abruptly her face brightened.
“Gaebril, she has been raised to the Accepted. Less than a year in the Tower, and raised already.”
The smile went as suddenly as it had come, and her mouth tightened. “When I put my hands on the
wretched child, she will wish she were still a novice.”
Light, Mat thought, will nothing put her in a good mood? He decided he was just going to have
to say it out, but he wished she did not look as if she meant to cut someone’s head off. “My Queen, by
chance I overheard—”
“Be silent, boy,” the dark man in the gold-encrusted coat said calmly. He was a handsome man,
almost as good-looking as Galad and nearly as youthful-seeming, despite the white streaking his
temples, but built on a bigger scale, with more than Rand’s height and very nearly Perrin’s shoulders.
“We will hear what you have to say in a moment.” He reached over Morgase’s shoulder and plucked
the letter out of her hand. Her glare turned on him—Mat could see her temper heating—but the dark
man laid a strong hand on her shoulder, never taking his eyes off what he was reading, and Morgase’s
anger melted. “It seems she has left the Tower again,” he said. “On the service of the Amyrlin Seat.
The woman oversteps herself again, Morgase.”
Mat had no trouble holding his tongue. Luck. It was stuck to the roof of his mouth. Sometimes I
don’t know if it’s good or bad . The dark man was the owner of the deep voice, the “Great Master”
who wanted Elayne’s head. She called him Gaebril. Her advisor wants to murder Elayne? Light!
And Morgase was staring up at him like an adoring dog with her master’s hand on her shoulder.
Gaebril turned nearly black eyes on Mat. The man had a forceful gaze, and a look of knowing.
“What can you tell us of this, boy?”
“Nothing . . . uh . . . my Lord.” Mat cleared his throat; the man’s stare was worse than the
Amyrlin’s. “I went to Tar Valon to see my sister. She’s a novice. Else Grinwell. I’m Thom Grinwell,
my Lord. The Lady Elayne learned I was meaning to see Caemlyn on my way back home—I’m from
Comfrey, my Lord; a little village north of Baerlon; I’d never seen any place bigger than Baerlon

before I went to Tar Valon—and she—the Lady Elayne, I mean—gave me that letter to bring.” He
thought Morgase had glanced at him when he said he came from north of Baerlon, but he knew there
was a village called Comfrey there; he remembered hearing it mentioned.
Gaebril nodded, but he said, “Do you know where Elayne was going, boy? Or on what business?
Speak the truth, and you have nothing to fear. Lie, and you will be put to the question.”
Mat did not have to pretend a worried frown. “My Lord, I only saw the Daughter-Heir the once.
She gave me the letter—and a gold mark!—and told me to bring it to the Queen. I know no more of
what is in it than I’ve heard here.” Gaebril appeared to consider it, with no sign on that dark face of
whether he believed a word or not.
“No, Gaebril,” Morgase said suddenly. “Too many have been put to the question. I can see the
need as you have shown it to me, but not for this. Not a boy who only brought a letter whose contents
he does not know.”
“As my Queen commands, so shall it be,” the dark man said. The tone was respectful, but he
touched her cheek in a way that made color come to her face and her lips part as if she expected a
kiss.
Morgase drew an unsteady breath. “Tell me, Thom Grinwell, did my daughter look well when
you saw her?”
“Yes, my Queen. She smiled, and laughed, and showed a saucy tongue—I mean. . . .”
Morgase laughed softly at the look on his face. “Do not be afraid, young man. Elayne does have
a saucy tongue, far too often for her own good. I am happy she is well.” Those blue eyes studied him
deeply. “A young man who has left his small village often finds it difficult to return to it. I think you
will travel far before you see Comfrey again. Perhaps you will even return to Tar Valon. If you do,
and if you see my daughter, tell her that what is said in anger is often repented. I will not remove her
from the White Tower before time. Tell her that I often think of my own time there, and miss the quiet
talks with Sheriam in her study. Tell her that I said that, Thom Grinwell.”
Mat shrugged uncomfortably. “Yes, my Queen. But . . . uh . . . I do not mean to go to Tar Valon
again. Once in any man’s life is enough. My da needs me to help work the farm. My sisters will be
stuck with the milking, with me gone.”
Gaebril laughed, a deep rumble of amusement. “Are you anxious then to milk cows, boy?
Perhaps you should see something of the world before it changes. Here!” He produced a purse and
tossed it; Mat felt coins through the wash-leather when he caught it. “If Elayne can give you a gold
mark for carrying her letter, I will give you ten for bringing it safely. See the world before you go
back to your cows.”
“Yes, my Lord.” Mat lifted the purse and managed a weak grin. “Thank you, my Lord.”
But the dark man had already waved him away and turned to Morgase with his fists on his hips.
“I think the time has come, Morgase, to lance that festering sore on the border of Andor. By your
marriage to Taringail Damodred, you have a claim to the Sun Throne. The Queen’s Guards can make
that claim as strong as any. Perhaps I can even aid them, in some small way. Hear me.”
Tallanvor touched Mat on the arm, and they backed away, bowing. Mat did not think anyone
noticed. Gaebril was still speaking, and every lord and lady seemed to hang on his words. Morgase
was frowning as she listened, yet she nodded as much as any other.

CHAPTER
47

To Race the Shadow

From the small courtyard with its pool of fish, Tallanvor led Mat swiftly to the great court at
the front of the Palace, behind the tall, gilded gates gleaming in the sun. It would be midday, soon.
Mat felt an urge to be gone, a need to hurry. It was hard keeping his pace to the young officer’s.
Someone might wonder, if he started running, and maybe—just maybe—things had really been the
way they seemed back there. Maybe Gaebril really did not suspect that he knew. Maybe. He
remembered those nearly black eyes, seizing and holding like a pair of pitchfork tines through his
head. Light, maybe. He forced himself to walk as if he had all the time in the world—Just a haybrain
country lout staring at the rugs and the gold. Just a mudfoot who’d never think anyone might put a
knife in his back—until Tallanvor let him through a sallyport in one of the gates, and followed him
out.
The fat officer with the rat’s eyes was still there with the Guards, and when he saw Mat his face
went red again. Before he could open his mouth, though, Tallanvor spoke. “He has delivered a letter
to the Queen from the Daughter-Heir. Be glad, Elber, that neither Morgase nor Gaebril knows you
tried to keep it from them. Lord Gaebril was most interested in the Lady Elayne’s missive.”
Elber’s face went from red to as white as his collar. He glared once at Mat, and scuttled back
along the line of guardsmen, his beady eyes peering through the bars of their face-guards as if to
determine whether any of them had seen his fear.
“Thank you,” Mat told Tallanvor, and meant it. He had forgotten all about the fat man until he
was staring him in the face again. “Fare you well, Tallanvor.”
He started across the oval plaza, trying not to walk too fast, and was surprised when Tallanvor
walked along. Light, is he Gaebril’s man, or Morgase’s? He was just beginning to feel an itch
between his shoulder blades, as if a knife might be about to go in—He doesn’t know, burn me!
Gaebril doesn’t suspect I know!—when the young officer finally spoke.
“Did you spend long in Tar Valon? In the White Tower? Long enough to learn anything of it?”
“I was only there three days,” Mat said cautiously. He would have made the time less—if he
could have delivered the letter without admitting ever being in Tar Valon, he would have—but he did
not think the man would believe he had gone all that way to see his sister and left the same day. What
under the Light is he after? “I learned what I saw in that time. Nothing of any importance. They did
not guide me around and tell me things. I was only there to see Else.”
“You must have heard something, man. Who is Sheriam? Does talking to her in her study mean
anything?”
Mat shook his head vigorously to keep relief from showing on his face. “I don’t know who she
is,” he said truthfully. Perhaps he had heard Egwene, or perhaps Nynaeve, mention the name. An Aes
Sedai, maybe? “Why should it mean anything?”

“I do not know,” Tallanvor said softly. “There is too much I do not know. Sometimes I think she
is trying to say something. . . .” He gave Mat a sharp look. “Are you a loyal Andorman, Thom
Grinwell?”
“Of course I am.” Light, if I say that much more often, I may start believing it. “What about
you? Do you serve Morgase and Gaebril loyally?”
Tallanvor gave him a look as hard as the dice’s mercy. “I serve Morgase, Thom Grinwell. Her, I
serve to the death. Fare you well!” He turned and strode back toward the Palace with a hand gripping
his sword hilt.
Watching him go, Mat muttered to himself. “I will wager this”—he gave Gaebril’s wash-leather
purse a toss—“that Gaebril says the same.” Whatever games they played in the Palace, he wanted no
place in any of them. And he meant to make sure Egwene and the others were out of them, too. Fool
women! Now I have to keep their bacon from burning instead of looking after my own! He did not
start to run until the streets hid him from the Palace.
When he came dashing into The Queen’s Blessing, nothing very much had changed in the library.
Thom and the innkeeper still sat over the stones board—a different game, he saw from the positions
of the stones, but no better for Gill—and the calico cat was back on the table, washing herself. A tray
holding their unlit pipes and the remains of a meal for two sat near the cat, and his belongings were
gone from the armchair. Each man had a wine cup at his elbow.
“I will be leaving, Master Gill,” he said. “You can keep the coin and take a meal out of it. I’ll
stay long enough to eat, but then I am on the road to Tear.”
“What is your hurry, boy?” Thom seemed to be watching the cat more than the board. “We only
just arrived here.”
“You delivered the Lady Elayne’s letter, then?” the innkeeper said eagerly. “And kept your skin
whole, it seems. Did you really climb over that wall like the other young man? No, that does not
matter. Did the letter soothe Morgase? Do we still have to keep tiptoeing on eggs, man?”
“I suppose it soothed her,” Mat said. “I think it did.” He hesitated a moment, bouncing Gaebril’s
purse on his hand. It made a clinking sound. He had not looked to see if it really held ten gold marks;
the weight was about right. “Master Gill, what can you tell me of Gaebril? Aside from the fact that he
does not like Aes Sedai. You said he had not been in Caemlyn long?”
“Why do you want to know about him?” Thom asked. “Basel, are you going to place a stone or
not?” The innkeeper sighed and stuck a black stone on the board, and the gleeman shook his head.
“Well, lad,” Gill said, “there is not much to tell. He came out of the west during the winter.
Somewhere out your way, I think. Maybe it was the Two Rivers. I’ve heard the mountains
mentioned.”
“We have no lords in the Two Rivers,” Mat said. “Maybe there are some up around Baerlon. I
do not know.”
“That could be it, lad. I had never even heard of him before, but I do not keep up with the
country lords. Came while Morgase was still in Tar Valon, he did, and half the city was afraid the
Tower was going to make her disappear, too. The other half did not want her back. The riots started
up again, the way they did last year at the tail of winter.”
Mat shook his head. “I do not care about politics, Master Gill. It’s Gaebril I want to know
about.” Thom frowned at him, and began cleaning the dottle from his long-stemmed pipe with a straw.
“It is Gaebril I am telling you about, lad,” Gill said. “During the riots, he made himself leader of
the faction supporting Morgase—got himself wounded in the fighting, I hear—and by the time she
returned, he had it all suppressed. Gareth Bryne didn’t like Gaebril’s methods—he can be a very hard

man—but Morgase was so pleased to find order restored that she named him to the post Elaida used
to hold.”
The innkeeper stopped. Mat waited for him to go on, but he did not. Thom thumbed his pipe full
of tabac and walked over to light a spill at a small lamp kept for the purpose on the mantel above the
fireplace.
“What else?” Mat asked. “The man has to have a reason for what he does. If he marries
Morgase, would he be king when she dies? If Elayne were dead, too, I mean?”
Thom choked lighting his pipe, and Gill laughed. “Andor has a queen, lad. Always a queen. If
Morgase and Elayne both died—the Light send it not so!—then Morgase’s nearest female relative
would take the throne. At least there’s no question of who that is this time—a cousin, the Lady Dyelin
—not like the Succession, after Tigraine vanished. It took two years before Morgase sat on the Lion
Throne, then. Dyelin could keep Gaebril as her advisor, or marry him to cement the line—though she
would not likely do that unless Morgase had had a child by him—but he would be the Prince Consort
even then. No more than that. Thank the Light, Morgase is a young woman, yet. And Elayne is healthy.
Light! The letter did not say she is ill, did it?”
“She is well.” For now, at least. “Isn’t there anything else you can tell me about him? You do
not seem to like him. Why?”
The innkeeper frowned in thought, and scratched his chin, and shook his head. “I suppose I
would not like him marrying Morgase, but I do not truly know why. He’s said to be a fine man; the
nobles all look to him. I do not like most of the men he’s brought into the Guards. Too much has
changed since he came, but I cannot lay it all at his door. There just seem to be too many people
muttering in corners since he came. You would think we were all Cairhienin, the way they were
before this civil war, all plotting and trying to find advantage. I keep having bad dreams since
Gaebril came, and I am not the only one. Fool thing to worry about, dreams. It is probably only worry
about Elayne, and what Morgase means to do concerning the White Tower, and people acting like
Cairhienin. I just do not know. Why are you asking all these questions about Lord Gaebril?”
“Because he wants to kill Elayne,” Mat said, “and Egwene and Nynaeve with her.” There was
nothing useful in what Gill had told him that he could see. Burn me, I don’t have to know why he
wants them dead. I just have to stop it. Both men were staring at him again. As if he were mad.
Again.
“Are you coming down sick again?” Gill said suspiciously. “I remember you staring crossways
at everyone the last time. It’s either that, or else you think this is some sort of prank. You have the
look of a prankster to me. If that is it, it’s a nasty one!”
Mat grimaced. “It is no bloody prank. I overheard him telling some man called Comar to cut
Elayne’s head off. And Egwene’s and Nynaeve’s while he was about it. A big man, with a white
stripe in his beard.”
“That does sound like Lord Comar,” Gill said slowly. “He was a fine soldier, but it is said he
left the Guard over some matter of weighted dice. Not that anyone says it to his face; Comar was one
of the best blades in the Guards. You really mean it, don’t you?”
“I think he does, Basel,” Thom said. “I very much think he does.”
“The Light shine on us! What did Morgase say? You did tell her, didn’t you? The Light burn you,
you did tell her!”
“Of course, I did,” Mat said bitterly. “With Gaebril standing right there, and her gazing at him
like a lovesick lapdog! I said, ‘I may be a simple village man who just climbed over your wall half
an hour past, but I already happen to know your trusted advisor there, the one you seem to be in love

with, intends to murder your daughter.’ Light, man, she’d have cut my head off!”
“She might have at that.” Thom stared into the elaborate carvings on the bowl of his pipe and
tugged one mustache. “Her temper was ever as sudden as lightning, and twice as dangerous.”
“You know it better than most, Thom,” Gill said absently. Staring at nothing, he scrubbed both
hands through his graying hair. “There has to be something I can do. I haven’t held a sword since the
Aiel War, but. . . . Well, that would do no good. Get myself killed and do nothing by it. But I must do
something!”
“Rumor.” Thom rubbed the side of his nose; he seemed to be studying the stones board and
talking to himself. “No one can keep rumors from reaching Morgase’s ears, and if she hears it
strongly enough, she will start to wonder. Rumor is the voice of the people, and the voice of the
people often speaks truth. Morgase knows that. There is not a man alive I would back against her in
the Game. Love or no love, once Morgase starts examining Gaebril closely, he’ll not be able to hide
as much as his childhood scars from her. And if she learns he means harm to Elayne”—he placed a
stone on the board; it seemed an odd placement at first glance, but Mat saw that in three more moves,
a third of Gill’s stones would be trapped—“Lord Gaebril will have a most elaborate funeral.”
“You and your Game of Houses,” Gill muttered. “Still, it might work.” A sudden smile appeared
on his face. “I even know who to tell to start it. All I need do is mention to Gilda that I dreamed it,
and in three days she’ll have told serving girls in half the New City that it is a fact. She is the greatest
gossip the Creator ever made.”
“Just be certain it cannot be traced back to you, Basel.”
“No fear of that, Thom. Why a week ago, a man told me one of my own bad dreams as a thing
he’d heard from somebody who’d had it from someone else. Gilda must have eavesdropped on me
telling it to Coline, but when I asked, he gave me a string of names that led all the way to the other
side of Caemlyn and vanished. Why, I actually went over there and found the last man, just out of
curiosity to see how many mouths had passed it, and he claimed it was his very own dream. No fear,
Thom.”
Mat did not really care what they did with their rumors—no rumors would help Egwene or the
others—but one thing puzzled him. “Thom, you seem to be taking this all very calmly. I thought
Morgase was the great love of your life.”
The gleeman stared into the bowl of his pipe again. “Mat, a very wise woman once told me that
time would heal my wounds, that time smoothed everything over. I didn’t believe her. Only she was
right.”
“You mean you do not love Morgase anymore.”
“Boy, it has been fifteen years since I left Caemlyn a half step ahead of the headsman’s axe, with
the ink of Morgase’s signature still wet on the warrant. Sitting here listening to Basel natter on”—Gill
protested, and Thom raised his voice—“natter on, I say, about Morgase and Gaebril, and how they
might marry, I realized the passion faded a long time gone. Oh, I suppose I am still fond of her,
perhaps I even love her a little, but it is not a grand passion anymore.”
“And here I half thought you’d go running up to the Palace to warn her.” He laughed, and was
surprised when Thom joined him.
“I am not so big a fool as that, boy. Any fool knows men and women think differently at times,
but the biggest difference is this. Men forget, but never forgive; women forgive, but never forget.
Morgase might kiss my cheek and give me a cup of wine and say how she has missed me. And then
she might just let the Guards haul me off to prison and the headsman. No. Morgase is one of the most
capable women I’ve ever known, and that is saying something. I could almost pity Gaebril once she

learns what he is up to. Tear, you say? Is there any chance of you waiting until tomorrow to leave? I
could use a night’s sleep.”
“I mean to be as far toward Tear as I can before nightfall.” Mat blinked. “Do you mean to come
with me? I thought you meant to stay here.”
“Did you not just hear me say I had decided not to have my head cut off? Tear sounds a safer
place to me than Caemlyn, and suddenly that does not seem so bad. Besides, I like those girls.” A
knife appeared in his hand and was as suddenly gone again. “I’d not like anything to happen to them.
But if you mean to reach Tear quickly, it’s Aringill you want. A fast boat will have us there days
sooner than horses, even if we rode them to death. And I don’t say it just because my bottom has
already taken on the shape of a saddle.”
“Aringill, then. As long as it’s fast.”
“Well,” Gill said, “I suppose if you are leaving, lad, I had better see about getting you that
meal.” He pushed back his chair and started for the door.
“Hold this for me, Master Gill,” Mat said, and tossed him the wash-leather purse.
“What’s this, lad? Coin?”
“Stakes. Gaebril doesn’t know it, but he and I have a wager.” The cat jumped down as Mat
picked up the wooden dice cup and spun the dice out on the table. Five sixes. “And I always win.”

CHAPTER
48

Following the Craft

As the Darter wallowed toward the docks of Tear, on the west bank of the River Erinin,
Egwene did not see anything of the oncoming city. Slumped head down at the rail, she stared down at
the waters of the Erinin rolling past the ship’s fat hull, and the frontmost sweep on her side as it
swung into her vision and back again, cutting white furrows in the river. It made her queasy, but she
knew raising her head would only make the sickness worse. Looking at the shore would only make the
slow, corkscrew motion of the Darter more apparent.
The vessel had moved in that twisting roll ever since Jurene. She did not care how it had sailed
before then; she found herself wishing the Darter had sunk before reaching Jurene. She wished they
had made the captain put in at Aringill so they could find another ship. She wished they had never
gone near a ship. She wished a great many things, most of them just to take her mind off where she
was.
The twisting was less now, under sweeps, than it had been under sail, but it had gone on too
many days now for the change to make much difference to her. Her stomach seemed to be sloshing
about inside her like milk in a stone jug. She gulped and tried to forget that image.
They had not done much in the way of planning on the Darter, she and Elayne and Nynaeve.
Nynaeve could seldom go ten minutes without vomiting, and seeing that always made Egwene lose
whatever food she had managed to get down. The increasing warmth as they went further downriver
did not help. Nynaeve was below now, no doubt with Elayne holding a basin for her again.
Oh, Light, no! Don’t think about that! Green fields. Meadows. Light, meadows do not heave
like that. Hummingbirds. No, not hummingbirds! Larks. Larks singing.
“Mistress Joslyn? Mistress Joslyn!”
It took her a moment to recognize the name she had chosen to give Captain Canin, and the
captain’s voice. She raised her head slowly and fixed her eyes on his long face.
“We are docking, Mistress Joslyn. You’ve kept saying how eager you were to be ashore. Well,
we’re there.” His voice did not hide his eagerness to be rid of his three passengers, two of whom did
little more than sick up, as he called it, and moan all night.
Barefoot, shirtless sailors were tossing lines to men on the stone dock that thrust out into the
river; the dockmen seemed to be wearing long leather vests in place of shirts. The sweeps had
already been drawn in, except for a pair fending the ship off from coming against the dock too hard.
The flat stones of the dock were wet; the air had a feel of rain not long gone, and that was a little
soothing. The twisting motion had ceased some time since, she realized, but her stomach remembered.
The sun was falling toward the west. She tried not to think of supper.
“Very good, Captain Canin,” she said with all the dignity she could summon. He’d not sound
like that if I were wearing my ring, not even if I were sick on his boots. She shuddered at the picture

in her mind.
Her Great Serpent ring and the twisted ring of the ter’angreal hung on a leather cord about her
neck, now. The stone ring felt cool against her skin—almost enough to counteract the damp warmth of
the air—but aside from that, she had found that the more she used the ter’angreal, the more she
wanted to touch it, without pouch or cloth between it and her.
Tel’aran’rhiod still showed her little of immediate use. Sometimes there had been glimpses of
Rand, or Mat, or Perrin, and more in her own dreams without the ter’angreal, but nothing of which
she could make any sense. The Seanchan, who she refused to think about. Nightmares of a Whitecloak putting Master Luhhan in the middle of a huge, toothed trap for bait. Why should Perrin have a
falcon on his shoulder, and what was important about him choosing between that axe he wore now
and a blacksmith’s hammer? What did it mean that Mat was dicing with the Dark One, and why did he
keep shouting, “I am coming!” and why did she think in the dream that he was shouting at her? And
Rand. He had been sneaking through utter darkness toward Callandor, while all around him six men
and five women walked, some hunting him and some ignoring him, some trying to guide him toward
the shining crystal sword and some trying to stop him from reaching it, appearing not to know where
he was, or only to see him in flashes. One of the men had eyes of flame, and he wanted Rand dead
with a desperation she could nearly taste. She thought she knew him. Ba’alzamon. But who were the
others? Rand in that dry, dusty chamber again, with those small creatures settling into his skin. Rand
confronting a horde of Seanchan. Rand confronting her, and the women with her, and one of them was
a Seanchan. It was all too confusing. She had to stop thinking about Rand and the others and put her
mind to what was right ahead of her. What is the Black Ajah up to? Why don’t I dream something
about them? Light, why can’t I learn to make it do what I want?
“Have the horses put ashore, Captain,” she told Canin. “I will tell Mistress Maryim and
Mistress Caryla.” That was Nynaeve—Maryim—and Elayne—Caryla.
“I have sent a man to tell them, Mistress Joslyn. And your animals will be on the dock as soon as
my men can rig a boom.”
He sounded very pleased to be rid of them. She thought about telling him not to hurry, but
rejected it immediately. The Darter’s corkscrewing might have stopped, but she wanted dry land
under her feet again. Now. Still, she stopped to pat Mist’s nose and let the gray mare nuzzle her palm,
to let Canin see she was in no great rush.
Nynaeve and Elayne appeared at the ladder from the cabins, laden with their bundles and
saddlebags, and Elayne almost as laden with Nynaeve. When Nynaeve saw Egwene watching, she
pushed herself away from the Daughter-Heir and walked unaided the rest of the way to where men
were setting a narrow gangplank to the dock. Two crewmen came to fasten a wide canvas sling under
Mist’s belly, and Egwene hurried below for her own things. When she came back up, her mare was
already on the dock and Elayne’s roan dangled in the canvas sling halfway there.
For a moment after her feet were on the dock, all she felt was relief. This would not pitch and
roll. Then she began to look at this city whose reaching had caused them such pains.
Stone warehouses backed the long docks themselves, and there seemed to be a great many ships,
large and small, alongside the docks or anchored in the river. Hastily she avoided looking at the
ships. Tear had been built on flat land, with barely a bump. Down muddy dirt streets between the
warehouses, she could see houses and inns and taverns of wood and stone. Their roofs of slate or tile
had oddly sharp corners, and some rose to a point. Beyond these, she could make out a high wall of
dark gray stone, and behind it the tops of towers with balconies high around them and white-domed
palaces. The domes had a squared shape to them, and the tower tops looked pointed, like some of the

roofs outside the wall. All in all, Tear was easily as big as Caemlyn or Tar Valon, and if not so
beautiful as either, it was still one of the great cities. Yet she found it hard to look at anything but the
Stone of Tear.
She had heard of it in stories, heard that it was the greatest fortress in the world and the oldest,
the first built after the Breaking of the World, yet nothing had prepared her for this sight. At first she
thought it was a huge, gray stone hill or a small, barren mountain covering hundreds of hides, its
length stretching from the Erinin west through the wall and into the city. Even after she saw the huge
banner flapping from its greatest height—three white crescent moons slanting across a field half red,
half gold; a banner waving at least three hundred paces above the river, yet large enough to be clearly
seen at that height—even after she made out battlements and towers, it was difficult to believe the
Stone of Tear had been built rather than carved out of a mountain already there.
“Made with the Power,” Elayne murmured. She was staring at the Stone, too. “Flows of Earth
woven to draw stone from the ground, Air to bring it from every corner of the world, and Earth and
Fire to make it all in one piece, without seam or joint or mortar. Atuan Sedai says the Tower could
not do it, today. Strange, given how the High Lords feel concerning the Power now.”
“I think,” Nynaeve said softly, eyeing the dockmen moving around them, “that given that very
thing, we should not mention certain other things aloud.” Elayne appeared torn between indignation—
she had spoken very softly—and agreement; the Daughter-Heir agreed with Nynaeve too often and too
readily to suit Egwene.
Only when Nynaeve is right, she admitted to herself grudgingly. A woman who wore the ring, or
was even associated with Tar Valon, would be watched here. The barefoot, leather-vested dockmen
were not paying the three of them any mind as they hurried about, carrying bales or crates on their
backs as often as on barrows. A strong odor of fish hung in the air; the next three docks had dozens of
small fishing boats clustered around them, just like those in the drawing in the Amyrlin’s study.
Shirtless men and barefoot women were hoisting baskets of fish out of the boats, mounds of silver and
bronze and green, and colors she had never suspected fish might be, such as bright red, and deep blue,
and brilliant yellow, some with stripes or splotches of white and other colors.
She lowered her voice for Elayne’s ear alone. “She is right, Caryla. Remember why you are
Caryla.” She did not want Nynaeve to hear such admissions. Her face did not change when she heard,
but Egwene could feel satisfaction radiating from her like heat from a cook stove.
Nynaeve’s black stallion was just being lowered to the dock; sailors had already carried their
tack off the ship and simply dumped it on the wet stones of the dock. Nynaeve glanced at the horses
and opened her mouth—Egwene was sure it was to tell them to saddle their animals—then closed it
again, tight-lipped, as if it had cost her an effort. She gave her braid one hard tug. Before the sling
was well out of the way, Nynaeve tossed the blue-striped saddle blanket across the black’s back and
hoisted her high-cantled saddle atop it. She did not even look at the other two women.
Egwene was not anxious to ride at that moment—the motion of a horse might be too close to the
motion of the Darter for her stomach—but another look at those muddy streets convinced her. Her
shoes were sturdy, but she would not enjoy having to clean mud off them, or having to hold her skirts
up as she walked, either. She saddled Mist quickly and climbed onto her back, settling her skirts,
before she could decide the mud might not be so bad after all. A little needlework on the Darter—
Elayne had done it all, this time; the Daughter-Heir sewed a very fine stitch—had divided all their
dresses nicely for riding astride.
Nynaeve’s face paled for a moment when she swung into her saddle and the stallion decided to
frisk. She kept a tight-mouthed grip on herself and a firm hand on her reins and soon had him under

control. By the time they had ridden slowly past the warehouses, she could speak. “We need to locate
Liandrin and the others without them learning we are asking after them. They surely know we are
coming—that someone is, at least—but I would like them not to know we are here until it is too late
for them.” She drew a deep breath. “I confess I have not thought of any way to do this. Yet. Do either
of you have any suggestions?”
“A thief-taker,” Elayne said without hesitation. Nynaeve frowned at her.
“You mean like Hurin?” Egwene said. “But Hurin was in the service of his king. Wouldn’t any
thief-taker here serve the High Lords?”
Elayne nodded, and for a moment Egwene envied the Daughter-Heir her stomach. “Yes, they
would. But thief-takers are not like the Queen’s Guards, or the Tairen Defenders of the Stone. They
serve the ruler, but people who have been robbed sometimes pay them to retrieve what was stolen.
And they also sometimes take money to find people. At least, they do in Caemlyn. I cannot think it is
different here in Tear.”
“Then we take rooms at an inn,” Egwene said, “and ask the innkeeper to find us a thief-taker.”
“Not an inn,” Nynaeve said as firmly as she guided the stallion; she never seemed to let the
animal get out of her control. After a moment she moderated her tone a little. “Liandrin, at least,
knows us, and we have to assume the others do, too. They will surely be watching the inns for
whoever followed the trail they sprinkled behind them. I mean to spring their trap in their faces, but
not with us inside. We’ll not stay at an inn.”
Egwene refused to give her the satisfaction of asking.
“Where then?” Elayne’s brow furrowed. “If I made myself known—and could make anyone
believe it, in these clothes and with no escort—we would be welcomed by most of the noble Houses,
and very likely in the Stone itself—there are good relations between Caemlyn and Tear—but there
would be no keeping it quiet. The entire city would know before nightfall. I cannot think of anywhere
else except an inn, Nynaeve. Unless you mean to go out to a farm in the country, but we will never
find them from the country.”
Nynaeve glanced at Egwene. “I will know when I see it. Let me look.”
Elayne’s frown swept from Nynaeve to Egwene and back again. “ ‘Do not cut off your ears
because you do not like your earrings,’ ” she muttered.
Egwene put her attention firmly on the street they were riding along. I will be burned if I’ll let
her think I am even wondering!
There were not a great many people out, not compared to the streets of Tar Valon. Perhaps the
thick mud in the street discouraged them. Carts and wagons lurched past, most pulled by oxen with
wide horns, the carter or wagoneer walking alongside with a long goad of some pale, ridged wood.
No carriages or sedan chairs used these streets. The odor of fish hung in the air here, too, and no few
of the men who hurried past carried huge baskets full of fish on their backs. The shops did not look
prosperous; none displayed wares outside, and Egwene seldom saw anyone go in. The shops had
signs—the tailor’s needle and bolt of cloth, the cutler’s knife and scissors, the weaver’s loom, and
the like—but the paint on most of them was peeling. The few inns had signs in as bad a state, and
looked no busier. The small houses crowded between inns and shops often had tiles or slates missing
from their roofs. This part of Tear, at least, was poor. And from what she saw on the faces, few of the
people here cared to try any longer. They were moving, working, but most of them had given up. Few
as much as glanced at three women riding where everyone else walked.
The men wore baggy breeches, usually tied at the ankle. Only a handful wore coats, long, dark
garments that fit arms and chest tightly, then became looser below the waist. There were more men in

low shoes than in boots, but most went barefoot in the mud. A good many wore no coat or shirt at all,
and had their breeches held up by a broad sash, sometimes colored and often dirty. Some had wide,
conical straw hats on their heads, and a few, cloth caps that sagged down one side of the face. The
women’s dresses had high necks, right up to their chins, and hems that stopped at the ankle. Many had
short aprons in pale colors, sometimes two or three, each smaller than the one beneath it, and most
wore the same straw hats as the men, but dyed to complement the aprons.
It was on a woman that she first saw how those who wore shoes dealt with the mud. The woman
had small wooden platforms tied to the soles of her shoes, lifting them two hands out of the mud; she
walked along as if her feet were planted firmly on the ground. Egwene saw others wearing the
platforms after that, men as well as women. Some of the women went barefoot, but not as many as the
men.
She was wondering which shop might sell those platforms, when Nynaeve suddenly turned her
black down an alleyway between a long, narrow two-story house and a stone-walled potter’s shop.
Egwene exchanged glances with Elayne—the Daughter-Heir shrugged—and then they followed.
Egwene did not know where Nynaeve was going or why—and she meant to have words with her
about it—but she did not mean to become separated, either.
The alley suddenly let into a small yard behind the house, fenced in by the buildings around it.
Nynaeve had already dismounted and tied her reins to a fig tree, where the stallion could not reach the
green things sprouting in a vegetable patch that took up half the yard. A line of stones had been laid to
make a path to the back door. Nynaeve strode to the door and knocked.
“What is it?” Egwene demanded in spite of herself. “Why are we stopping here?”
“Did you not see the herbs in the front windows?” Nynaeve knocked again.
“Herbs?” Elayne said.
“A Wisdom,” Egwene told her as she got down from her saddle and tied Mist alongside the
black. Gaidin is no good name for a horse. Does she think I don’t know who she means it for?
“Nynaeve has found herself a Wisdom, or Seeker, or whatever they call her here.”
A woman opened the door just enough to look out suspiciously. At first Egwene thought she was
stout, but then the woman opened the door the rest of the way. She was certainly well padded, but the
way she moved spoke of muscle underneath. She looked as strong as Mistress Luhhan, and some in
Emond’s Field claimed Alsbet Luhhan was almost as strong as her husband. It was not true, but it was
not far wrong.
“How can I help you?” the woman said in an accent like the Amyrlin’s. Her gray hair was
arranged in thick curls that hung down the sides of her head, and her three aprons were in shades of
green, each slightly darker than the one below, but even the topmost pale. “Which one of you needs
me?”
“I do,” Nynaeve said. “I need something for a queasy stomach. And perhaps one of my
companions does, too. That is, if we’ve come to the right place?”
“You’re not Tairen,” the woman said. “I should have known that by your clothes, before you
spoke. I’m called Mother Guenna. I am called a Wise Woman, too, but I’m old enough not to trust that
to caulk a seam. You come, and I will give you something for your stomach.”
It was a neat kitchen, though not large, with copper pots hanging on the wall, and dried herbs and
sausages from the ceiling. Several tall cupboards of pale wood had doors carved with some sort of
tall grass. The table had been scrubbed almost white, and the backs of the chairs were carved with
flowers. A pot of fishy-smelling soup was simmering atop the stone stove, and a kettle with a spout,
just beginning to steam. There was no fire on the stone hearth, for which Egwene was more than

grateful; the stove added enough to the heat, though Mother Guenna seemed not to notice it at all.
Dishes lined the mantel, and more were stacked neatly on shelves to either side. The floor looked as
if it had just been swept.
Mother Guenna closed the door after them, and as she was crossing the kitchen to her cupboards,
Nynaeve said, “Which tea will you give me? Chainleaf? Or bluewort?”
“I would if I had any of either.” Mother Guenna rooted in the shelves a moment and came out
with a stone jar. “Since I’ve had no time to glean of late, I will give you a brew of marshwhite
leaves.”
“I am not familiar with that,” Nynaeve said slowly.
“It works as well as chainleaf, but it has a bite to the taste some don’t care for.” The big woman
sprinkled dried and broken leaves into a blue teapot and carried it over to the fireplace to add hot
water. “Do you follow the craft, then? Sit.” She gestured to the table with a hand holding two blueglazed cups she had taken from the mantel. “Sit, and we’ll talk. Which one of you has the other
stomach?”
“I am fine,” Egwene said casually as she took a chair. “Are you queasy, Caryla?” The DaughterHeir shook her head with perhaps a touch of exasperation.
“No matter.” The gray-haired woman poured out a cup of dark liquid for Nynaeve, then sat
across the table from her. “I made enough for two, but marshwhite tea keeps longer than salted fish. It
works better the longer it sits, too, but it also grows more bitter. Makes a race between how much you
need your stomach settled and what your tongue can stand. Drink, girl.” After a moment, she filled the
second cup and took a sip. “You see? It will not hurt you.”
Nynaeve raised her own cup, making a small sound of displeasure at the first taste. When she
lowered the cup again, though, her face was smooth. “It is just a little bitter perhaps. Tell me, Mother
Guenna, will we have to put up with this rain and mud much longer?”
The older woman frowned, parceling displeasure among the three of them before she settled on
Nynaeve. “I am not a Sea Folk Windfinder, girl,” she said quietly. “If I could tell the weather, I’d
sooner stick live silverpike down my dress than admit it. The Defenders take that sort of thing for next
to Aes Sedai work. Now, do you follow the craft or not? You look as if you have been traveling.
What is good for fatigue?” she barked suddenly.
“Flatwort tea,” Nynaeve said calmly, “or andilay root. Since you ask questions, what would you
do to ease birthing?”
Mother Guenna snorted. “Apply warm towels, child, and perhaps give her a little whitefennel if
it was an especially hard birth. A woman needs no more than that, and a soothing hand. Can’t you
think of a question any country farmwife could not answer? What do you give for pains in the heart?
The killing kind.”
“Powdered gheandin blossom on the tongue,” Nynaeve said crisply. “If a woman has biting
pains in her belly and spits up blood, what do you do?”
They settled down as if testing each other, tossing questions and answers back and forth faster
and faster. Sometimes the questioning lagged a moment when one spoke of a plant the other knew only
by another name, but they picked up speed again, arguing the merits of tinctures against teas, salves
against poultices, and when one was better than another. Slowly, all the quick questions began
shifting toward the herbs and roots one knew that the other did not, digging for knowledge. Egwene
began to grow irritable listening.
“After you give him the boneknit,” Mother Guenna was saying, “you wrap the broken limb in
toweling soaked in water where you’ve boiled blue goatflowers—only the blue, mind!”—Nynaeve

nodded impatiently—“and as hot as he can stand it. One part blue goatflowers to ten of water, no
weaker. Replace the towels as soon as they stop steaming, and keep it up all day. The bone will knit
twice as fast as with boneknit alone, and twice as strong.”
“I will remember that,” Nynaeve said. “You mentioned using sheepstongue root for eye pain.
I’ve never heard—”
Egwene could stand it no longer. “Maryim,” she broke in, “do you really believe you’ll ever
need to know these things again? You are not a Wisdom any longer, or have you forgotten?”
“I have not forgotten anything,” Nynaeve said sharply. “I remember a time when you were as
eager to learn new things as I am.”
“Mother Guenna,” Elayne said blandly, “what do you do for two women who cannot stop
arguing?”
The gray-haired woman pursed her lips and frowned at the table. “Usually, men or women, I tell
them to stay away from each other. That is the best thing, and the easiest.”
“Usually?” Elayne said. “What if there is a reason they cannot stay apart. Say they are sisters.”
“I do have a way to make an arguer stop,” the big woman said slowly. “It is not something I urge
anyone to try, but some do come to me.” Egwene thought there was a suspicion of a smile at the
corners of her mouth. “I charge a silver mark each for women. Two for men, because men make more
fuss. There are some will buy anything, if it costs enough.”
“But what is the cure?” Elayne asked.
“I tell them they have to bring the other one here with them, the one they argue with. Both expect
me to quiet the other’s tongue.” Despite herself, Egwene was listening. She noticed Nynaeve seemed
to be paying sharp attention, as well. “When they have paid me,” Mother Guenna continued, flexing
one hefty arm, “I take them out back and stick their heads in my rain barrel till they agree to stop their
arguing.”
Elayne burst out laughing.
“I think I may have done something very like that myself,” Nynaeve said in a voice that was
much too light. Egwene hoped her own expression looked nothing like Nynaeve’s.
“I’d not be surprised if you have.” Mother Guenna was grinning openly now. “I tell them the next
time I hear they’ve been arguing, I will do it for free, but I’ll use the river. It is remarkable how often
the cure works, for men especially. And it is remarkable what it has done for my reputation. For some
reason, none of the people I cure this way ever tells anyone else the details, so someone asks for the
cure every few months. If you’ve been fool enough to eat mudfish, you do not go around telling
people. I trust none of you have any wish to spend a silver mark.”
“I think not,” Egwene said, and glared at Elayne when she went off in peals of laughter again.
“Good,” the gray-haired woman said. “Those I cure of arguing have a tendency to avoid me like
stingweed caught in their nets, unless they actually take sick, and I am enjoying your company. Most
of those who come at present want something to take away bad dreams, and they grow sour when I
have nothing to give them.” For a moment she slipped into a frown, rubbing her temples. “It is good to
see three faces that do not look as if there is nothing left but to jump over the side and drown. If you
are staying long in Tear, you must come see me again. The girl called you Maryim? I am Ailhuin. The
next time, we’ll talk over some good Sea Folk tea instead of something that curdles your tongue.
Light, but I hate the taste of marshwhite; mudfish would taste sweeter. In fact, if you have time to stay
now, I’ll brew a pot of Tremalking black. Not long till supper, either. It’s just bread and soup and
cheese, but you are welcome.”
“That would be very nice, Ailhuin,” Nynaeve said. “Actually. . . . Ailhuin, if you have a spare

bedroom, I’d like to hire it for the three of us.”
The big woman looked at each of them without saying anything. Getting to her feet, she tucked
the pot of marshwhite tea away in the herb cupboard, then fetched a red teapot and a pouch from
another. Only when she had brewed a pot of Tremalking black, put four clean cups and a bowl of
honeycomb on the table along with pewter spoons, and reclaimed her chair did she speak.
“I’ve three empty bedrooms upstairs, now my daughters are all married. My husband, the Light
shine on him, was lost in a storm in the Fingers of the Dragon near twenty years ago. There need be
no talk of hiring, if I decide to let you have the rooms. If, Maryim.” Stirring honey into her tea, she
studied them again.
“What will make you decide?” Nynaeve asked quietly.
Ailhuin continued to stir, as if she had forgotten to drink. “Three young women, riding fine
horses. I don’t know much about horses, but those look as fine as what the lords and ladies ride, to
me. You, Maryim, know enough of the craft that you ought to have hung herbs in your window
already, or should be choosing where to do it. I’ve never heard of a woman practicing the craft too
far from where she was born, but by your tongue, you are a long way.” She glanced at Elayne. “Not
many places with hair that color. Andor, I’d say, by your speech. Fool men are always talking about
finding a yellow-haired Andor girl. What I want to know is why? Running away from something? Or
running after something? Only, you don’t look like thieves to me, and I never heard of three women
chasing after a man together. So tell me why, and if I like it, the rooms are yours. If you want to pay
something, you buy a bit of meat now and then. Meat is dear since the trade up to Cairhien fell away.
But first the why, Maryim.”
“We are chasing after something, Ailhuin,” Nynaeve said. “Or rather, after some people.”
Egwene schooled herself to stillness and hoped she was doing as well as Elayne, who was sipping
her tea as if she were listening to talk about dresses. Egwene did not believe Ailhuin Guenna’s dark
eyes missed a great deal. “They stole some things, Ailhuin,” Nynaeve went on. “From my mother.
And they did murder. We are here to see justice done.”
“Burn my soul,” the large woman said, “have you no menfolk? Men are not good for much
beyond heavy hauling and getting in the way, most of the time—and kissing and such—but if there’s a
battle to be fought or a thief to catch, I say let them do it. Andor is as civilized as Tear. You are not
Aiel.”
“There was no one else but us,” Nynaeve said. “Those who might have come in our place were
killed.”
The three murdered Aes Sedai, Egwene thought. They could not have been Black Ajah. But if
they had not been killed, the Amyrlin would not have been able to trust them. She’s trying to keep
to the bloody Three Oaths, but she is skirting it close.
“Aaah,” Ailhuin said sadly. “They killed your men? Brothers, or husbands, or fathers?” Spots of
color bloomed in Nynaeve’s cheeks, and the older woman mistook the emotion. “No, don’t tell me,
girl. I’ll not pull up old grief. Let it lie on the bottom till it melts away. There, there, you calm
yourself.” It was an effort for Egwene not to growl with disgust.
“I must tell you this,” Nynaeve said in a stiff voice. The red still colored her face. “These
murderers and thieves are Darkfriends. They are women, but they are as dangerous as any
swordsman, Ailhuin. If you wondered why we did not seek an inn, that is why. They may know we
follow, and they may be watching for us.”
Ailhuin waved it all away with a sniff. “Of the four most dangerous folk I know, two are women
who never carry as much as a knife, and only one of the men is a swordsman. As for Darkfriends. . . .

Maryim, when you are as old as I, you’ll learn that false Dragons are dangerous, lionfish are
dangerous, sharks are dangerous, and sudden storms out of the south; but Darkfriends are fools. Filthy
fools, but fools. The Dark One is locked up where the Creator put him, and no Fetches or fangfish to
scare children will get him out. Fools don’t frighten me unless they’re working the boat I’m riding. I
suppose you don’t have any proof you could take to the Defenders of the Stone? It would be just your
word against theirs?”
What is a “Fetch”? Egwene wondered. Or a “fangfish,” for that matter.
“We will have proof when we find them,” Nynaeve said. “They will have the things they stole,
and we can describe them. They are old things, and of little value to anyone but us, and our friends.”
“You would be surprised what old things can be worth,” Ailhuin said dryly. “Old Leuese Mulan
pulled up three heartstone bowls and a cup in his nets last year, down in the Fingers of the Dragon.
Now, instead of a fishing smack, he owns a ship trading up the river. Old fool did not even know
what he had till I told him. Very likely there’s more right where those came from, but Leuese couldn’t
even remember the exact spot. I do not know how he ever managed to get a fish into his net. Half the
fishing boats in Tear were down there for months afterwards, dragging for cuendillar, not grunts or
flatfish, and some had lords saying where to pull the nets. That’s what old things can be worth, if they
are old enough. Now, I’ve decided you do need a man in this, and I know just the one.”
“Who?” Nynaeve said quickly. “If you mean a lord, one of the High Lords, remember we have
no proof to offer till we find them.”
Ailhuin laughed until she wheezed. “Girl, nobody from the Maule knows a High Lord, or any
kind of lord. Mudfish don’t school with silversides. I will bring you the dangerous man I know who
isn’t a swordsman, and the more dangerous of the two, at that. Juilin Sandar is a thief-catcher. The
best of them. I do not know how it is in Andor, but here a thief-catcher will work for you or me as
soon as for a lord or a merchant, and charge less at that. Juilin can find these women for you if they
can be found, and bring your things back without you having to go near these Darkfriends.”
Nynaeve agreed as if she were still not entirely sure, and Ailhuin tied those platforms to her
shoes—clogs, she called them—and hurried out. Egwene watched her go, through one of the kitchen
windows, past the horses and around the corner up the alley.
“You are learning how to be Aes Sedai, Maryim,” she said as she turned from the window.
“You manipulate people as well as Moiraine.” Nynaeve’s face went white.
Elayne stalked across the floor and slapped Egwene’s face. Egwene was so shocked she could
only stare. “You go too far,” the golden-haired woman said sharply. “Too far. We must live together,
or we will surely die together! Did you give Ailhuin your true name? Nynaeve told her what we
could, that we seek Darkfriends, and that was risk enough, linking us with Darkfriends. She told her
they were dangerous, murderers. Would you have had her say they are Black Ajah? In Tear? Would
you risk everything on whether Ailhuin would keep that to herself?”
Egwene rubbed her cheek gingerly. Elayne had a strong arm. “I do not have to like doing it.”
“I know,” Elayne sighed. “Neither do I. But we do have to.”
Egwene turned back to peering through the window at the horses. I know we do. But I do not
have to like it.

CHAPTER
49

A Storm in Tear

Egwene finally returned to the table and her tea. She thought perhaps Elayne was right, that she
had gone too far, but she could not bring herself to apologize, and they sat in silence.
When Ailhuin returned, she had a man with her, a lean fellow in his middle years who looked as
if he had been carved from aged wood. Juilin Sandar took off his clogs by the door and hung his flat,
conical straw hat on a peg. A sword-breaker, much like Hurin’s but with short slots to either side of
the long one, hung from a belt over his brown coat, and he carried a staff exactly as tall as he was, but
not much thicker than his thumb and made of that pale wood, like ridged joints, that the ox-drivers
used for their goads. His short-cut black hair lay flat on his head, and his quick, dark eyes seemed to
note and record every detail of the room. And of everyone in it. Egwene would have bet he examined
Nynaeve twice, and to her, at least, Nynaeve’s lack of reaction was blatant; it was obvious she knew
it, too.
Ailhuin motioned him to a place at the table, where he turned back the cuffs of his coat sleeves,
bowed to each of them in turn, and sat with his staff propped against his shoulder, not speaking until
the gray-haired woman had made a fresh pot of tea and everyone had sipped from their cups.
“Mother Guenna has told me of your problem,” he said quietly as he set his cup down. “I will
help you if I can, but the High Lords may have their own business to put me to, soon.”
The big woman snorted. “Juilin, when did you begin haggling like a shopkeeper trying to charge
silk prices for linen? Do not claim you know when the High Lords will summon you before they do.”
“I won’t claim it,” Sandar told her with a smile, “but I know when I’ve seen men on the rooftops
in the night. Just out of the corner of my eye—they can hide like pipefish in reeds—but I have seen the
movement. No one has reported a theft yet, but there are thieves working inside the walls, and you can
buy your supper with that. Mark me. Before another week, I’ll be summoned to the Stone because a
band of thieves is breaking into merchants’ houses, or even lords’ manors. The Defenders may guard
the streets, but when thieves need tracking they send for a thief-catcher, and me before any other. I am
not trying to drive up my price, but whatever I do for these pretty women, I must do soon.”
“I believe he speaks the truth,” Ailhuin said reluctantly. “He’ll tell you the moon is green and
water white if he thinks it will bring him a kiss, but he lies less than most men about other things. He
may be the most honest man ever born in the Maule.” Elayne put a hand over her mouth, and Egwene
struggled not to laugh. Nynaeve sat unmoved and obviously impatient.
Sandar grimaced at the gray-haired woman, then apparently decided to ignore what she had said.
He smiled at Nynaeve. “I will admit that I’m curious about these thieves. I’ve known women thieves,
and bands of thieves, but I never heard of a band of women thieves before. And I owe Mother Guenna
favors.” His eyes seemed to record Nynaeve all over again.
“What do you charge?” she asked sharply.

“To recover stolen goods,” he said briskly, “I ask the tenth part of the value of what I recover.
For finding someone, I ask a silver mark for each person. Mother Guenna says the things stolen have
little value except to you, mistress, so I suggest you take that choice.” He smiled again; he had very
white teeth. “I would not take money from you at all, except that the brotherhood would frown on it,
but I will take as little as I can. A copper or two, no more.”
“I know a thief-taker,” Elayne told him. “From Shienar. A very respectful man. He carries a
sword as well as a sword-breaker. Why do you not?”
Sandar looked startled for a moment, and then upset with himself for being startled. He had not
caught her hint, or else had decided to ignore it. “You are not Tairen. I have heard of Shienar,
mistress, tales of Trollocs, and every man a warrior.” His smile said these were tales for children.
“True stories,” Egwene said. “Or true enough. I have been to Shienar.”
He blinked at her, and went on. “I am not a lord, nor a wealthy merchant, nor even a soldier. The
Defenders do not trouble foreigners much for carrying swords—unless they mean to stay long, of
course—but I would be thrust into a cell under the Stone. There are laws, mistress.” His hand rubbed
along his staff, as if unconsciously. “I do as well as may be, without a sword.” He focused his smile
on Nynaeve once more. “Now, if you will describe these things—”
He stopped as she set her purse on the edge of the table and counted out thirteen silver marks.
Egwene thought she had chosen the lightest coins; most were Tairen, only one Andoran. The Amyrlin
had given them a great deal of gold, but even that would not last forever.
Nynaeve looked into the purse thoughtfully before tightening the strings and putting it back into
her pouch. “There are thirteen women for you to find, Master Sandar, with as much silver again when
you do. Find them, and we will recover our property ourselves.”
“I will do that myself for less than this,” he protested. “And there’s no need for extra rewards. I
charge what I charge. Have no fear I’ll take a bribe.”
“There is no fear of that,” Ailhuin agreed. “I said he is honest. Just do not believe him if he says
he loves you.” Sandar glared at her.
“I pay the coin, Master Sandar,” Nynaeve said firmly, “so I choose what I am buying. Will you
find these women, and no more?” She waited for him to nod, reluctantly, before going on. “They may
be together, or not. The first is a Taraboner. She is a little taller than I, with dark eyes and pale,
honey-colored hair that she wears in many small braids after the Tarabon fashion. Some men might
think her pretty, but she would not consider it a compliment. She has a mean, sulky mouth. The second
is Kandori. She has long black hair with a white streak above her left ear, and. . . .”
She gave no names, and Sandar asked for none. Names were so easily changed. His smile was
gone now that the business was at hand. Thirteen women she described as he listened intently, and
when she was done, Egwene was sure he could have recited them back word for word.
“Mother Guenna may have told you this,” Nynaeve finished, “but I will repeat it. These women
are more dangerous than you can believe. Over a dozen have died at their hands already, that I know
of, and I would not be surprised if that was only a drop of the blood on their hands.” Sandar and
Ailhuin both blinked at that. “If they discover you are asking after them, you will die. If they take you,
they will make you tell where we are, and Mother Guenna will probably die with us.” The grayhaired woman looked disbelieving. “Believe it!” Nynaeve’s stare demanded agreement. “Believe it,
or I’ll take back the silver and find another with more brains!”
“When I was young,” Sandar said, voice serious, “a cutpurse put her knife in my ribs because I
thought a pretty young girl wouldn’t be as quick to stab as a man. I do not make that mistake anymore.
I will behave as if these women are all Aes Sedai, and Black Ajah.” Egwene almost choked, and he

gave her a rueful grin as he scooped the coins into his own purse and stuck it behind his sash. “I did
not mean to frighten you, mistress. There are no Aes Sedai in Tear. It may take a few days, unless they
are together. Thirteen women together will be easy to find; apart, they will be harder. But either way,
I will find them. And I will not frighten them away before you learn where they are.”
When he had donned his straw hat and clogs and departed by the back door, Elayne said, “I hope
he is not overconfident. Ailhuin, I heard what he said but. . . . He does understand that they are
dangerous, does he not?”
“He has never been a fool except for a pair of eyes or a pretty ankle,” the gray-haired woman
said, “and that is a failing of every man. He is the best thief-catcher in Tear. Have no worry. He will
find these Darkfriends of yours.”
“It will rain again before morning.” Nynaeve shivered, despite the warmth of the room. “I feel a
storm gathering.” Ailhuin only shook her head and set about filling bowls with fish soup for supper.
After they ate and cleaned up, Nynaeve and Ailhuin sat at the table talking of herbs and cures.
Elayne worked on a small patch of embroidery she had begun on the shoulder of her cloak, tiny blue
and white flowers, then read in a copy of The Essays of Willim of Maneches that Ailhuin had on her
small shelf of books. Egwene tried reading, but neither the essays, nor The Travels of Jain
Farstrider, nor the humorous tales of Aleria Elffin could hold her interest for more than a few pages.
She fingered the stone ter’angreal through the bosom of her dress. Where are they? What do they
want in the Heart? None but the Dragon—none but Rand—can touch Callandor, so what do they
want? What? What?
As night deepened, Ailhuin showed them each to a bedroom on the second floor, but after she
had gone to her own, they gathered in Egwene’s by the light of a single lamp. Egwene had already
undressed to her shift; the cord hung ’round her neck with the two rings. The striped stone felt far
heavier than the gold. This was what they had done every night since leaving Tar Valon, with the sole
exception of that night with the Aiel.
“Wake me after an hour,” she told them.
Elayne frowned. “So short, this time?”
“Do you feel uneasy?” Nynaeve said. “Perhaps you are using it too often.”
“We would still be in Tar Valon scrubbing pots and hoping to find a Black sister before a Gray
Man found us if I had not,” Egwene said sharply. Light, Elayne’s right. I am snapping like a sulky
child. She took a deep breath. “Perhaps I am uneasy. Maybe it is because we are so close to the Heart
of the Stone, now. So close to Callandor. So close to the trap, whatever it is.”
“Be careful,” Elayne said, and Nynaeve said, more quietly, “Be very careful, Egwene. Please.”
She was tugging her braid in short jerks.
As Egwene lay down on the low-posted bed, with them on stools to either side, thunder rolled
across the sky. Sleep came slowly.
It was the rolling hills again, as always at first, flowers and butterflies under spring sunshine,
soft breezes and birds singing. She wore green silk, this time, with golden birds embroidered over
her breasts, and green velvet slippers. The ter’angreal seemed light enough to drift up out of her
dress except for the weight of the Great Serpent ring holding it down.
By simple trial and error she had learned a little of the rules of Tel’aran’rhiod—even this
World of Dreams, this Unseen World, had its rules, if odd ones; she was sure she did not know a
tenth of them—and one way to make herself go where she wanted. Closing her eyes, she emptied her
mind as she would have to embrace saidar. It was not as easy, because the rosebud kept trying to

form, and she kept sensing the True Source, kept aching to embrace it, but she had to fill the emptiness
with something else. She pictured the Heart of the Stone, as she had seen it in these dreams, formed it
in every detail, perfect within the void. The huge, polished redstone columns. The age-worn stones of
the floor. The dome, far overhead. The crystal sword, untouchable, slowly revolving hilt-down in
midair. When it was so real she was sure she could reach out and touch it, she opened her eyes, and
she was there, in the Heart of the Stone. Or the Heart of the Stone as it existed in Tel’aran’rhiod.
The columns were there, and Callandor. And around the sparkling sword, almost as dim and
insubstantial as shadows, thirteen women sat cross-legged, staring at Callandor as it revolved.
Honey-haired Liandrin turned her head, looking straight at Egwene with those big, dark eyes, and her
rosebud mouth smiled.
Gasping, Egwene sat up in bed so fast she almost fell off the side.
“What is the matter?” Elayne demanded. “What happened? You look frightened.”
“You only just closed your eyes,” Nynaeve said softly. “This is the first time since the very
beginning that you’ve come back without us waking you. Something did happen, didn’t it?” She tugged
her braid sharply. “Are you all right?”
How did I get back? Egwene wondered. Light, I do not even know what I did. She knew she
was only trying to put off what she had to say. Unfastening the cord around her neck, she held the
Great Serpent ring and the larger, twisted ter’angreal on her palm. “They are waiting for us,” she
said finally. There was no need to say who. “And I think they know we are in Tear.”
Outside, the storm broke over the city.
Rain drumming on the deck over his head, Mat stared at the stones board on the table between
him and Thom, but he could not really concentrate on the game, even with an Andoran silver mark
riding on the outcome. Thunder crashed, and lightning flashed in the small windows. Four lamps lit
the captain’s cabin of the Swift. Bloody ship may be as sleek as the bird, but it’s still taking too
bloody long. The vessel gave a small jolt, then another; the motion seemed to change. He had better
not run us into the bloody mud! If he is not making the best time he can wring out of this buttertub,
I will stuff that gold down his throat! Yawning—he had not slept well since leaving Caemlyn; he
could not stop worrying enough to sleep well—yawning, he set a white stone on the intersection of
two lines; in three moves, he would capture nearly a fifth of Thom’s black stones.
“You could be a good player, boy,” the gleeman said around his pipe, placing his next stone, “if
you put your mind to it.” His tabac smelled like leaves and nuts.
Mat reached for another stone from the pile at his elbow, then blinked and let it lie. In the same
three moves, Thom’s stones would surround over a third of his. He had not seen it coming, and he
could see no escape. “Do you ever lose a game? Have you ever lost a game?”
Thom removed his pipe and knuckled his mustaches. “Not in a long while. Morgase used to beat
me about half the time. It is said good commanders of soldiers and good players of the Great Game
are good at stones, as well. She is the one, and I’ve no doubt she could command a battle, too.”
“Wouldn’t you rather dice some more? Stones take too much time.”
“I like a chance to win more than one toss in nine or ten,” the white-haired man said dryly.
Mat bounded to his feet as the door banged open to admit Captain Derne. The square-faced man
whipped his cloak from his shoulders, shaking the rain off and muttering curses to himself. “The Light
sear my bones, I do not know why I ever let you hire Swift. You, demanding more flaming speed in
the blackest night or the heaviest rain. More speed. Always more bloody speed! Could have run on a

bloody mudflat a hundred times over by now!”
“You wanted the gold,” Mat said harshly. “You said this heap of old boards was fast, Derne.
When do we reach Tear?”
The captain smiled a tight smile. “We are tying off to the dock, now. And burn me for a bloody
farmer if I carry anything that can flaming talk ever again! Now, where is the rest of my gold?”
Mat hurried to one of the small windows and peered out. In the harsh glare of lightning flashes
he could see a wet stone dock, if not much else. He fished the second purse of gold from his pocket
and tossed it to Derne. Whoever heard of a riverman who didn’t dice! “About time,” he growled.
Light send I’m not too late.
He had stuffed all of his spare clothes and his blankets into the leather scrip, and he hung that on
one side of him and the roll of fireworks on the other, from the cord he tied to it. His cloak covered it
all, but gapped a little in the front. Better he got wet than the fireworks. He could dry out and be as
good as new; a test with a bucket had shown fireworks could not. I guess Rand’s da was right. Mat
had always thought the Village Council would not set them off in the rain because they made a better
show on clear nights.
“Aren’t you about ready to sell those things?” Thom was settling his gleeman’s cloak on his
shoulders. It covered his leather-cased harp and flute, but his bundle of clothes and blankets he slung
on his back outside the patch-covered cloak.
“Not until I figure out how they work, Thom. Besides, think what fun it will be when I set them
all off.”
The gleeman shuddered. “As long as you don’t do it all at once, boy. As long as you don’t throw
them in the fireplace at supper. I’d not put it past you, the way you’ve been behaving with them.
You’re lucky the captain here did not throw us off the ship two days ago.”
“He wouldn’t.” Mat laughed. “Not while that purse was in the offing. Eh, Derne?”
Derne was tossing the purse of gold in his hand. “I have not asked before this, but you’ve given
me the gold, now, and you’ll not take it back. What is this all about? All this flaming speed.”
“A wager, Derne.” Yawning, Mat picked up his quarterstaff, ready to go. “A wager.”
“A wager!” Derne stared at the heavy purse. The other just like it was locked in his money chest.
“There must be a flaming kingdom riding on it!”
“More than that,” Mat said.
Rain bucketed down on the deck so hard that he could not see the gangplank except when
lightning crackled above the city; the roar of the downpour barely let him hear himself think. He could
see lights in windows up a street, though. There would be inns, up there. The captain had not come on
deck to see them ashore, and none of the crew had stayed out in the rain, either. Mat and Thom made
their way to the stone dock alone.
Mat cursed when his boots sank into the mud of the street, but there was nothing for it, so he kept
on, striding along as fast as he could with his boots and the butt of his staff sticking at every step. The
air smelled of fish, rank even with the rain. “We’ll find an inn,” he said, loudly, so he could be heard,
“and then I will go out looking.”
“In this weather?” Thom shouted back. Rain was rolling down his face, but he was more
interested in keeping his instruments covered than his face.
“Comar could have left Caemlyn before us. If he had a good horse instead of the crowbaits we
were riding, he could have set out downriver from Aringill maybe a full day ahead of us, and I don’t
know how much of that we caught up with that idiot Derne.”
“It was a quick passage,” Thom allowed. “Swift deserves its name.”

“Be that as it may, Thom, rain or no rain, I have to find him before he finds Egwene and
Nynaeve, and Elayne.”
“A few more hours won’t make much difference, boy. There are hundreds of inns in a city the
size of Tear. There may be hundreds more outside the walls, some of them little places with no more
than a dozen rooms to let, so tiny you could walk right by them and never know they were there.” The
gleeman hitched the hood of his cloak up more, muttering to himself. “It will take weeks to search
them all. But it will take Comar the same weeks. We can spend the night in out of the rain. You can
wager whatever coin you have left that Comar won’t be out in it.”
Mat shook his head. A tiny inn with a dozen rooms. Before he left Emond’s Field, the biggest
building he had ever seen was the Winespring Inn. He doubted if Bran al’Vere had any more than a
dozen rooms to let. Egwene had lived with her parents and her sisters in the rooms at the front of the
second floor. Burn me, sometimes I think we should never any of us have left Emond’s Field. But
Rand surely had had to, and Egwene would probably have died if she had not gone to Tar Valon. Now
she might die because she did go. He did not think he could settle for the farm again; the cows and
the sheep certainly would not play dice. But Perrin still had a chance to go home. Go home, Perrin,
he found himself thinking. Go home while you still can. He gave himself a shake. Fool! Why would
he want to? He thought of bed, but pushed it away. Not yet.
Lightning streaked across the sky, three jagged bolts together, casting a stark light over a narrow
house that seemed to have bunches of herbs hanging in the windows, and a shop, shut up tight, but a
potter’s from the sign with its bowls and plates. Yawning, he hunched his shoulders against the
driving rain and tried to pull his boots out of the clinging mud more quickly.
“I think I can forget about this part of the city, Thom,” he shouted. “All this mud, and that stink of
fish. Can you see Nynaeve or Egwene—or Elayne!—choosing to stay here? Women like things neat
and tidy, Thom, and smelling good.”
“May be, boy,” Thom muttered, then coughed. “You would be surprised what women will put up
with. But it may be.”
Holding his cloak to keep the roll of fireworks covered, Mat lengthened his stride. “Come on,
Thom. I want to find Comar or the girls tonight, one or the other.”
Thom limped after him, coughing now and again.
They strode through the wide gates in the city—unguarded, in the rain—and Mat was relieved to
feel paving stones under his feet again. And not more than fifty paces up the street was an inn, the
windows of the common room spilling light onto the street, music drifting out into the night. Even
Thom covered that last fifty paces through the rain quickly, limp or no limp.
The White Crescent had a landlord whose girth made his long blue coat fit snugly below the
waist as well as above, unlike those of most of the men in the low-backed chairs at the tables. Mat
thought the landlord’s baggy breeches, tied at the ankle above low shoes, had to be big enough for
two ordinary men to fit inside, one in each leg. The serving women wore dark, high-necked dresses
and short white aprons. There was a fellow playing a hammered dulcimer between the two stone
fireplaces. Thom eyed the fellow critically and shook his head. The rotund innkeeper, Cavan Lopar
by name, was more than glad to give them rooms. He frowned at their muddy boots, but silver from
Mat’s pocket—the gold was running low—and Thom’s patch-covered cloak smoothed his fat
forehead. When Thom said he would perform for a small fee some nights, Lopar’s chins waggled
with pleasure. Of a big man with a white streak in his beard, he knew nothing, nor of three women
meeting the descriptions Mat gave. Mat left everything but his cloak and his quarterstaff in his room,
barely looking to see that it had a bed—sleep was enticing, but he refused to let himself think of it—

then wolfed down a spicy fish stew and rushed back out into the rain. He was surprised that Thom
came with him.
“I thought you wanted to be in where it’s dry, Thom.”
The gleeman patted the flute case he still had under his cloak. The rest of his things were up in
his room. “People talk to a gleeman, boy. I may learn something you would not. I’d not like to see
those girls harmed any more than you.”
There was another inn a hundred paces down the rain-filled street on the other side, and another
two hundred beyond that, and then more. Mat took them as he came to them, ducking in long enough
for Thom to flourish his cloak and tell a story, then let someone buy him a cup of wine afterwards
while Mat asked around after a tall man with a white streak in his close-cut black beard and three
women. He won a few coins at dice, but he learned nothing, and neither did Thom. He was just glad
the gleeman seemed to be taking only a few sips of wine at each inn; Thom had been close to
abstemious on the boat, but Mat had not been certain he would not dive back into the wine once they
reached Tear. By the time they had visited two dozen common rooms, Mat felt as if his eyelids had
weights. The rain had lessened a bit, but it still fell steadily in big drops, and as the rain fell off the
wind had freshened. The sky had the dark gray look of coming dawn.
“Boy,” Thom muttered, “if we don’t go back to The White Crescent, I am going to go to sleep
here in the rain.” He stopped to cough. “Do you realize you’ve marched right past three inns? Light, I
am so tired I can’t think. Do you have a scheme of where to go that you have not told me?”
Mat stared blearily up the street at a tall man in a cloak hurrying around a corner. Light, I am
tired. Rand is five hundred leagues from here, playing at being the bloody Dragon. “What? Three
inns?” They were standing almost in front of another, The Golden Cup according to the sign creaking
in the wind. It looked nothing like a dice cup, but he decided to give it a try anyway. “One more,
Thom. If we don’t find them here, we’ll go back and go to bed.” Bed sounded better than a dice game
with a hundred gold marks riding on the toss, but he made himself go in.
Two steps into the common room Mat saw him. The big man wore a green coat with blue stripes
down puffy sleeves, but it was Comar, close-cut black beard with a white streak over his chin and
all. He sat in one of the strangely low-backed chairs, at a table on the far side of the room, rattling a
leather dice cup and smiling at the man across from him. That fellow wore a long coat and baggy
breeches, and he was not smiling. He stared at the coins on the table as if wishing he had them back in
his purse. Another dice cup sat at Comar’s elbow.
Comar upended the leather cup in his hand, and began laughing almost before the dice stopped
spinning. “Who is next?” he called loudly, pulling the wager to his side of the table. There was
already a considerable pile of silver in front of him. He scooped the dice into the cup and rattled
them. “Surely someone else wants to try his luck?” It seemed that no one did, but he kept rattling the
cup and laughing.
The innkeeper was easy to pick out, though they did not seem to wear aprons in Tear. His coat
was the same shade of deep blue as that of every other innkeeper Mat had spoken to. A plump man,
though little more than half the size of Lopar and with half that fellow’s number of chins, he was
sitting at a table by himself, polishing a pewter mug furiously and glaring across the room toward
Comar, though not when Comar was looking. Some of the other men gave the bearded man sidelong
frowns, too. But not when he was looking.
Mat suppressed his first urge, which was to rush over to Comar, drub him over the head with his
quarterstaff, and demand to know where Egwene and the others were. Something was wrong here.
Comar was the first man he had seen wearing a sword, but the way the men looked at him was more

than fear of a swordsman. Even the serving woman who brought Comar a fresh cup of wine—and was
pinched for her trouble—had a nervous laugh for him.
Look at it from every side, Mat thought wearily. Half the trouble I get into is from not doing
that. I have to think. Tiredness seemed to have stuffed his head with wool. He motioned to Thom,
and they strolled over to the innkeeper, who eyed them suspiciously when they sat down. “Who is the
man with the stripe in his beard?” Mat asked.
“Not from the city, are you?” the innkeeper said. “He is a foreigner, too. I’ve never seen him
before tonight, but I know what he is. Some outlander who has come here and made his fortune in
trade. A merchant rich enough to wear a sword. That is no reason for him to treat us like this.”
“If you have never seen him before,” Mat said, “how do you know he is a merchant?”
The innkeeper looked at him as if he were stupid. “His coat, man, and his sword. He cannot be a
lord or a soldier if he’s from off, so he has to be a rich merchant.” He shook his head for the stupidity
of foreigners. “They come to our places, to look down their noses at us, and fondle the girls under our
very eyes, but he has no call to do this. If I go to the Maule, I don’t gamble for some fisherman’s
coins. If I go to the Tavar, I do not dice with the farmers come to sell their crops.” His polishing
gained in ferocity. “Such luck, the man has. It must be how he made his fortune.”
“He wins, does he?” Yawning, Mat wondered how he would do dicing with another man who
had luck.
“Sometimes he loses,” the innkeeper muttered, “when the stake is a few silver pennies.
Sometimes. But let it reach a silver mark. . . . No less than a dozen times tonight, I have seen him win
at Crowns with three crowns and two roses. And half again as often, at Top, it has been three sixes
and two fives. He tosses nothing but sixes at Threes, and three sixes and a five every throw at
Compass. If he has such luck, I say the Light shine on him, and well to him, but let him use it with
other merchants, as is proper. How can a man have such luck?”
“Weighted dice,” Thom said, then coughed. “When he wants to be sure of winning, he uses dice
that always show the same face. He is smart enough not to have made it the highest toss—folk become
suspicious if you always throw the king”—he raised an eyebrow at Mat—“just one that’s all but
impossible to beat, but he cannot change that they always show the same face.”
“I have heard of such,” the innkeeper said slowly. “Illianers use them, I hear.” Then he shook his
head. “But both men use the same cup and dice. It cannot be.”
“Bring me two dice cups,” Thom said, “and two sets of dice. Crowns or spots, it makes no
difference, so long as they are the same.”
The innkeeper frowned at him, but left—prudently taking the pewter cup with him—and came
back with two leather cups. Thom rolled the five bone cubes from one onto the table in front of Mat.
Whether with spots or symbols, every set of dice Mat had ever seen had been either bone or wood.
These had spots. He picked them up, frowning at Thom. “Am I supposed to see something?”
Thom dumped the dice from the other cup into his hand, then, almost too quickly to follow,
dropped them back in and twisted the cup over to rest upside down on the table before the dice could
fall out. He kept his hand on top of the cup. “Put a mark on each of them, boy. Something small, but
something you’ll know for your mark.”
Mat found himself exchanging puzzled glances with the innkeeper. Then they both looked at the
cup upside down under Thom’s hand. He knew Thom was up to something tricky—gleemen were
always doing things that were impossible, like eating fire and pulling silk out of the air—but he did
not see how Thom could do anything with him watching close. He unsheathed his belt knife and made
a small scratch on each die, right across the circle of six spots.

“All right,” he said, setting them back on the table. “Show me your trick.”
Thom reached over and picked up the dice, then set them down again a foot away. “Look for
your marks, boy.”
Mat frowned. Thom’s hand was still on the upended leather cup; the gleeman had not moved it or
taken Mat’s dice anywhere near it. He picked up the dice . . . and blinked. There was not a scratch on
them. The inn-keeper gasped.
Thom turned his free hand over, revealing five dice. “Your marks are on these. That is what
Comar is doing. It is a child’s trick, simple, though I’d never have thought he had the fingers for it.”
“I do not think I want to play dice with you after all,” Mat said slowly. The innkeeper was
staring at the dice, but not as if he saw any solution. “Call the Watch, or whatever you call it here,”
Mat told him. “Have him arrested.” He’ll kill nobody in a prison cell. Yet what if they are already
dead? He tried not to listen, but the thought persisted. Then I’ll see him dead, and Gaebril, whatever
it takes! But they aren’t, burn me! They can’t be!
The innkeeper was shaking his head. “Me? Me, denounce a merchant to the Defenders? They
would not even look at his dice. He could say one word, and I would be in chains working the
channeldredges in the Fingers of the Dragon. He could cut me down where I stood, and the Defenders
would say I had earned it. Perhaps he will go away after a while.”
Mat gave him a wry grimace. “If I expose him, will that be good enough? Will you call the
Watch, or the Defenders or whoever, then?”
“You do not understand. You are a foreigner. Even if he is from off, he is a wealthy man,
important.”
“Wait here,” Mat told Thom. “I do not mean to let him reach Egwene and the others, whatever it
takes.” He yawned as he scraped back his chair.
“Wait, boy,” Thom called after him, soft yet urgent. The gleeman pushed himself up out of his
chair. “Burn you, you don’t know what you’re putting your foot into!”
Mat waved for him to stay there and walked over to Comar. No one else had taken up the
bearded man’s challenge, and he eyed Mat with interest as Mat leaned his quarterstaff against the
table and sat down.
Comar studied Mat’s coat and grinned nastily. “You want to wager coppers, farmer? I do not
waste my time with—” He cut off as Mat set an Andoran gold crown on the table and yawned at him,
making no effort to cover his mouth. “You say little, farmer, though your manners could use
improving, but gold has a voice of its own and no need of manners.” He shook the leather cup in his
hand and spilled the dice out. He was chuckling before they came to rest, showing three crowns and
two roses. “You’ll not beat that, farmer. Perhaps you have more gold hidden in those rags that you
want to lose? What did you do? Rob your master?”
He reached for the dice, but Mat scooped them up ahead of him. Comar glared, but let him have
the cup. If both tosses were the same, they would throw again until one man won. Mat smiled as he
rattled the dice. He did not mean to give Comar a chance to change them. If they threw the same toss
three or four times in a row—exactly the same, every time—even these Defenders would listen. The
whole common room would see; they would have to back his word.
He spilled the dice onto the tabletop. They bounced oddly. He felt—something—shifting. It was
as if his luck had gone wild. The room seemed to be writhing around him, tugging at the dice with
threads. For some reason he wanted to look at the door, but he kept his eyes on the dice. They came to
rest. Five crowns. Comar’s eyes looked ready to pop out of his head.
“You lose,” Mat said softly. If his luck was in to this extent, perhaps it was time to push it. A

voice in the back of his head told him to think, but he was too tired to listen. “I think your luck is
about used up, Comar. If you’ve harmed those girls, it’s all gone.”
“I have not even found . . .” Comar began, still staring at the dice, then jerked his head up. His
face had gone white. “How do you know my name?”
He had not found them, yet. Luck, sweet luck, stay with me. “Go back to Caemlyn, Comar. Tell
Gaebril you could not find them. Tell him they are dead. Tell him anything, but leave Tear tonight. If I
see you again, I’ll kill you.”
“Who are you?” the big man said unsteadily. “Who—?” The next instant his sword was out and
he was on his feet.
Mat shoved the table at him, overturning it, and grabbed for his quarterstaff. He had forgotten
how big Comar was. The bearded man pushed the table right back at him. Mat fell over with his
chair, holding a bare grasp on his staff, as Comar heaved the table out of the way and stabbed at him.
Mat threw his feet against the man’s middle to stop his rush, swung the staff awkwardly, just enough
to deflect the sword. But the blow knocked the staff from his fingers, and he found himself gripping
Comar’s wrist, instead, with the man’s blade a hand from his face. With a grunt he rolled backwards,
heaving as hard as he could with his legs. Comar’s eyes widened as he sailed over Mat to crash onto
a table, face up. Mat scrambled for his staff, but when he had it, Comar had not moved.
The big man lay with his hips and legs sprawled across the top of the table, the rest of him
hanging down with his head on the floor. The men who had been sitting at the table were on their feet
a safe distance away, wringing their hands and eyeing each other nervously. A low, worried buzz
filled the common room, not the noise Mat expected.
Comar’s sword lay within easy reach of his hand. But he did not move. He stared at Mat, though,
as Mat kicked the sword away and went to one knee beside him. Light! I think his back is broken! “I
told you you should have gone, Comar. Your luck is all used up.”
“Fool,” the big man breathed. “Do you . . . think I . . . was the only . . . one hunting them? They
won’t . . . live till. . . .” His eyes stared at Mat, and his mouth was open, but he said no more. Nor
ever would again.
Mat met the glazing stare, trying to will more words out of the dead man. Who else, burn you?
Who? Where are they? My luck. Burn me, what happened to my luck? He became aware of the
innkeeper pulling frantically at his arm.
“You must go. You must. Before the Defenders come. I will show them the dice. I will tell them
it was an outlander, but a tall man. With red-colored hair, and gray eyes. No one will suffer. A man I
dreamed of last night. No one real. No one will contradict me. He took coin from everyone with his
dice. But you must go. You must!” Everyone else in the room was studiously looking another way.
Mat let himself be hauled away from the dead man and pushed outside. Thom was already
waiting in the rain. He seized Mat’s arm and limped down the street hurriedly, pulling Mat stumbling
behind him. Mat’s hood hung down his back; the rain soaked his hair and poured down his face, down
his neck, but he did not notice. The gleeman kept looking over his shoulder, searching the street
beyond Mat.
“Are you asleep, boy? You did not look asleep back there. Come on, boy. The Defenders will
arrest any outlander within two streets, no matter what description that innkeeper gives.”
“It’s the luck,” Mat mumbled. “I’ve figured it out. The dice. My luck works best when things are
. . . random. Like dice. Not much good for cards. No good at stones. Too much pattern. It has to be
random. Even finding Comar. I’d stopped visiting every inn. I walked into that one by chance. Thom,
if I am going to find Egwene and the others in time, I have to look without any pattern.”

“What are you talking about? The man is dead. If he already killed them. . . . Well, you’ve
avenged them. If he hasn’t, you saved them. Now will you bloody walk faster? The Defenders won’t
be long coming, and they are not so gentle as the Queen’s Guards.”
Mat shook his arm free and picked up his pace unsteadily, dragging the quarterstaff. “He let it
slip that he hadn’t located them, yet. But he said he was not the only one. Thom, I believe him. I was
looking him in the eye, and he was telling the truth. I still have to find them, Thom. And now I don’t
even know who is after them. I have to find them.”
Stifling a huge yawn with his fist, Thom pulled Mat’s hood up against the rain. “Not tonight, boy.
I need sleep, and so do you.”
Wet. My hair’s dripping in my face . His head seemed fuzzy. With a need for sleep, he realized
after a moment. And he realized how tired he was, if he had to think just to know it. “All right, Thom.
But I am going to look again as soon as it’s light.” Thom nodded and coughed, and they made their
way back to The White Crescent through the rain.
Dawn was not long in coming, but Mat rousted himself out of bed, and he and Thom set off trying
to search every inn inside the walls of Tear. Mat let himself wander wherever the mood and the next
turning took him, not looking for inns at all, and tossing a coin to decide whether to go in. For three
days and nights he did this, and for three days and nights it rained without stopping, sometimes
thundering, sometimes quiet, but always pouring down.
Thom’s cough grew worse, so he had to stop playing the flute and telling stories, and he would
not carry his harp out in that weather; he insisted on going along, however, and men still talked to a
gleeman. Mat’s luck with the dice seemed even better since he had begun this random wander, though
he never stayed in one inn or tavern long enough to win more than a few coins. Neither of them heard
anything useful. Rumors of war with Illian. Rumors of invading Mayene. Rumors of invasion from
Andor, of the Sea Folk shutting off trade, of Artur Hawkwing’s armies returning from the dead.
Rumors the Dragon was coming. The men Mat gambled with were as gloomy about one rumor as the
next; they seemed to him to hunt for the darkest rumors they could find and half believe them all. But
he heard not a whisper that might lead him to Egwene and the others. Not one innkeeper had seen
women matching their descriptions.
He began to have bad dreams, no doubt from all his worrying. Egwene and Nynaeve and Elayne,
and some fellow with close-cropped white hair, wearing a coat with puffy, striped sleeves like
Comar’s, laughing and weaving a net around them. Only sometimes it was Moiraine he was weaving
the net for, and sometimes he held a crystal sword instead, a sword that blazed like the sun as soon as
he touched it. Sometimes it was Rand who held the sword. For some reason, he dreamed of Rand a
good deal.
Mat was sure it was all because he was not getting enough sleep, not eating except when he
happened to remember, but he would not stop. He had a wager to win, he told himself, and he meant
to win this one if it killed him.

CHAPTER
50

The Hammer

The afternoon sun was hot as the ferry docked in Tear; puddles stood on the steaming stones of
the dock, and the air seemed almost as damp to Perrin as Illian’s had. The air smelled of pitch and
wood and rope—he could see shipyards further south along the river—of spices and iron and barley,
of perfumes and wines and a hundred different aromas he could not single out from the melange, most
coming from the warehouses behind the docks. When the wind swirled momentarily out of the north,
he caught the scents of fish, too, but those faded as the wind swung back. No smells of anything to
hunt. His mind reached out to feel for wolves before he realized what he was doing and snapped his
guards shut. He had done that too often of late. There had been no wolves, of course. Not in a city like
this. He wished it did not feel so—alone.
As soon as the ramp at the end of the barge was lowered, he led Stepper up to the dock after
Moiraine and Lan. The huge shape of the Stone of Tear lay off to their left, shadowed so that it looked
like a mountain despite the great banner at its highest point. He did not want to look at the Stone, but it
seemed impossible to look at the city without seeing it. Is he here yet? Light, if he has already tried
to get into that, he could be dead already. And then it would all be for nothing.
“What are we meant to find here?” Zarine asked behind him. She had not stopped asking
questions; she just did not ask them of the Aes Sedai or the Warder. “Illian showed us Gray Men and
the Wild Hunt. What does Tear hold that—that someone wants to keep you from so badly?”
Perrin glanced around; none of the dockmen shuttling cargo about seemed to have heard. He was
sure he would have smelled fear if they had. He bit back the sharp remark that hung on the end of his
tongue. She had a quicker tongue, and a sharper.
“I wish you did not sound so eager,” Loial rumbled. “You seem to think it will all be as easy as
Illian, Faile.”
“Easy?” Zarine muttered. “Easy! Loial, we were nearly killed twice in one night. Illian was
enough for a Hunter’s song in itself. What makes you call it easy?”
Perrin grimaced. He wished Loial had not decided to call Zarine by that name she had chosen; it
was a constant reminder that Moiraine thought she was Min’s falcon. And it did nothing to stop Perrin
wondering if she was the beautiful woman Min had warned him against, too. At least I’ve not run up
against the hawk. Or a Tuatha’an with a sword! Now that would the strangest of all, or I am a
wool merchant!
“Stop asking questions, Zarine,” he said as he swung up into Stepper’s saddle. “You will find
out why we are here when Moiraine decides to tell you.” He tried not to look at the Stone.
She turned those dark, tilted eyes on him. “I do not think you know why, blacksmith. I think that
is why you will not tell me, because you cannot. Admit it, farmboy.”
With a small sigh, he rode off the docks after Moiraine and Lan. Zarine did not dig at Loial in

that cutting way when the Ogier refused to answer her questions. He thought she must be trying to
browbeat him into using that name. He would not.
Moiraine had tied the oiled cloak behind her saddle, atop the innocuous-looking bundle that held
the Dragon banner, and despite the heat had donned the blue linen cloak from Illian. Its deep, wide
hood hid her face. Her Great Serpent ring was on a cord around her neck. Tear, she had said, did not
forbid the presence of Aes Sedai, only channeling, but the Defenders of the Stone kept a close eye on
any woman who wore the ring. She did not want to be watched on this visit to Tear.
Lan had stuffed his color-shifting cloak into his saddlebags two days earlier, when it had
become apparent that whoever had sent the Darkhounds—Sammael, Perrin thought with a shiver, and
tried not to think of the name at all—whoever had sent them had not sent any more pursuit. The
Warder had made no concessions to the heat of Illian, and he made none to the lesser heat of Tear.
His gray-green coat was buttoned up all the way.
Perrin wore his coat half undone, and the neck of his shirt untied. Tear might be a little cooler
than Illian, but it was still as hot as summer in the Two Rivers, and as always after rain, the dampness
of the air made the heat seem worse. His axe belt hung looped around the tall pommel of his saddle. It
was handy there, if he needed it, and he felt better not wearing it.
He was surprised at the mud in the first streets they rode along. Only villages and smaller towns
had dirt streets, that he had seen, and Tear was one of the great cities. But the people did not seem to
mind, many going barefoot. A woman walking on little wooden platforms caught his attention for a
time, and he wondered why they did not all wear them. Those baggy breeches on the men looked as if
they might be cooler than the snug ones he wore, but he was sure he would feel a fool if he tried them.
He made a picture in his head of himself wearing those breeches and one of those round straw hats,
and chuckled at it.
“What do you find funny, Perrin?” Loial asked. His ears were drooping till their tufts were
hidden in his hair, and he looked at the people in the street worriedly. “These folk look . . . defeated,
Perrin. They did not look this way when I was here last. Even people who let their grove be cut down
do not deserve to look like this.”
As Perrin began to study faces instead of just looking at everything at once, he saw that Loial
was right. Something had gone out of too many of those faces. Hope, maybe. Curiosity. They barely
glanced at the party riding by, except to get out of the way of the horses. The Ogier, mounted on an
animal as big as a draft horse, might as well have been Lan, or Perrin.
The streets changed, gaining wide stone paving, after they passed inside the gates of the high,
gray city wall, past the hard, dark eyes of soldiers in breastplates over red coats with wide sleeves
ending in narrow white cuffs, and rimmed, round helmets with a ridge over the top. Instead of the
baggy breeches other men wore, theirs were tight, and tucked into knee-high boots. The soldiers
frowned at Lan’s sword and fingered their own, stared sharply at Perrin’s axe and his bow, but in a
way, despite their frowns and sharp looks, there was something beaten in their faces, too, as if
nothing were really worth the effort any longer.
The buildings were larger and taller inside the walls, though most were made no differently from
those outside. The roofs looked a bit odd to Perrin, especially those that came to points, but he had
seen so many different kinds of roof since leaving home that he only wondered what kind of nails they
used with their tiles. In some places, the people did not use nails on their roof tiles at all.
Palaces and great buildings stood among the smaller and more ordinary, seemingly placed
haphazardly; a structure of towers and squarish, white domes, surrounded on all sides by wide
streets, might have shops and inns and houses on the other sides of those streets. A huge hall fronted

by squared columns of marble four paces on a side, with fifty steps to climb to reach bronze doors
five spans high, had a bakery one side and a tailor on the other.
More men wore coats and breeches like the soldiers’ here, though in brighter colors and without
armor, and some even wore swords. None of them went barefoot, not even those in baggy breeches.
The women’s dresses were often longer, their necklines lower to bare shoulders and even bosom, the
cloth as likely to be silk as wool. The Sea Folk traded a good deal of silk through Tear. As many
sedan chairs and carriages drawn by teams of horses moved through the streets as ox-carts and
wagons. Yet too many of the faces had that same look of having given up.
The inn Lan chose, the Star, had a weaver’s shop on one side and a smithy on the other, with
narrow alleyways between. The smithy was of undressed gray stone, the weaver’s and the inn of
wood, though the Star stood four stories tall and had small windows in its roof as well. The rattle of
looms was hard-pressed to compete with the clang of the smith’s hammer. They handed their horses
over to stablemen, to be taken around back, and went inside the inn. There were fish smells from the
kitchen, baking and perhaps stewing, and the scent of roast mutton. The men in the common room all
wore the tight coats and loose breeches; Perrin did not think richer men—somehow he was sure the
men in colorful coats with puffy sleeves and the bare-shouldered women in bright silk were all rich,
or nobles—those folk would not put up with the noise. Perhaps that was why Lan had chosen it.
“How are we supposed to sleep with this racketing?” Zarine muttered.
“No questions?” he said with a smile. For a moment he thought she was going to stick out her
tongue at him.
The innkeeper was a round-faced, balding man in a long, deep blue coat and those loose
breeches, who bowed over hands clasped across his stout belly. His face had that look, a weary
resignation. “The Light shine on you, mistresses, and welcome,” he sighed. “The Light shine on you,
masters, and welcome.” He gave a small start at Perrin’s yellow eyes, then passed wearily on to
Loial. “The Light shine on you, friend Ogier, and welcome. It is a year or more since I have seen one
of your kind in Tear. Some work or other at the Stone. They stayed in the Stone, of course, but I saw
them in the street one day.” He finished with another sigh, seemingly unable to summon any curiosity
as to why another Ogier had come to Tear, or why any of them had come, for that matter.
The balding man, whose name was Jurah Haret, showed them to their rooms himself. Apparently
Moiraine’s silk dress and the way she kept her face hidden, taken with Lan’s hard face and sword,
made them a lady and her guard in his eyes, and so worthy of his personal attention. Perrin he
obviously took as some kind of retainer, and Zarine he was plainly unsure of—to her visible disgust
—and Loial was, after all, an Ogier. He called men to push beds together for Loial, and offered
Moiraine a private room for her meals if she wished. She accepted graciously.
They kept together through it all, making a small procession through the upper halls until Haret
bowed and sighed his way out of their presence, leaving them all where they had begun, outside
Moiraine’s room. The walls were white plaster, and Loial’s head brushed the hall ceiling.
“Odious fellow,” Zarine muttered, brushing furiously at the dust on her narrow skirts with both
hands. “I believe he took me for your handmaid, Aes Sedai. I will not stand for that!”
“Watch your tongue,” Lan said softly. “If you use that name where folk can hear, you will regret
it, girl.” She looked as if she were going to argue, but his icy blue eyes stilled her tongue this time, if
it did not cool her glare.
Moiraine ignored them. Staring off at nothing, she worked her cloak in her hands almost as if
wiping them. Unaware what she was doing, in Perrin’s opinion.
“How do we go about finding Rand?” he asked, but she did not appear to hear him. “Moiraine?”

“Remain close to the inn,” she said after a moment. “Tear can be a dangerous city for those who
do not know its ways. The Pattern can be torn, here.” That last was soft, as if to herself. In a stronger
voice she said, “Lan, let us see what we can discover without attracting attention. The rest of you,
stay close to the inn!”
“ ‘Stay close to the inn,’ ” Zarine mimicked as the Aes Sedai and the Warder disappeared down
the stairs. But she said it quietly enough that they would not hear. “This Rand. He is the one you
called the. . . .” If she looked like a falcon right then, it was a very uneasy falcon. “And we are in
Tear, where the Heart of the Stone holds. . . . And the Prophecies say. . . . The Light burn me,
ta’veren, is this a story I want to be in?”
“It is not a story, Zarine.” For a moment Perrin felt almost as hopeless as the innkeeper had
sounded. “The Wheel weaves us into the Pattern. You chose to tangle your thread with ours; it’s too
late to untangle it, now.”
“Light!” she growled. “Now you sound like her!”
He left her there with Loial and went to put his things in his room—it had a low bed,
comfortable but small, as city people seemed to think befitted a servant, a washstand, a stool, and a
few pegs on the cracked plaster wall—and when he came out, they were both gone. The ring of
hammer on anvil called to him.
So much in Tear looked odd that it was a relief to walk into the smithy. The ground floor was all
one large room with no back wall except for two long doors that stood open on a yard for shoeing
horses and oxen, complete with an ox sling. Hammers stood in their stands, tongs of various kinds and
sizes hung on the exposed joists of the walls, buttresses and hoof knives and other farrier’s tools lay
neatly arranged on wooden benches with chisels and beak irons and swages and all the implements of
the blacksmith’s craft. Bins held lengths of iron and steel in various thicknesses. Five grinding wheels
of different roughness stood about the hard dirt floor, six anvils, and three stone-sided forges with
their bellows, though only one held glowing coals. Quenching barrels stood ready to hand.
The smith was plying his hammer on yellow-hot iron gripped in heavy tongs. He wore baggy
breeches and had pale blue eyes, but the long leather vest over his bare chest and apron were not
much different from those Perrin and Master Luhhan had worn back in Emond’s Field, and his thick
arms and shoulders spoke of years working metal. His dark hair had almost the same amount of gray
that Perrin remembered in Master Luhhan’s. More vests and aprons hung on the wall, as if the man
had apprentices, but they were not in evidence now. The forge-fire smelled like home. The hot iron
smelled like home.
The smith turned to thrust the piece he was working back into the coals, and Perrin stepped over
to work the bellows for him. The man glanced at him, but said nothing. Perrin pulled the bellows
handle up and down with slow, steady, even strokes, keeping the coals at the right heat. The smith
went back to working the hot iron, on the rounded horn of the anvil, this time. Perrin thought he might
be making a barrel scrape. The hammer rang with sharp, quick blows.
The man spoke without looking up from his work. “Apprentice?” was all he said.
“Yes,” Perrin replied just as simply.
The smith worked on for a time. It was a barrel scrape, for cleaning the insides of wooden
barrels. Now and again he eyed Perrin consideringly. Setting his hammer down, just for a moment, the
smith picked up a short length of thick, square stock and pushed it into Perrin’s hand, then picked up
his hammer again and resumed work. “See what you can do with that,” he said.
Without even thinking about it, Perrin stepped over to an anvil on the other side of the forge and
tapped the stock against its edge. It made a nice ring. The steel had not been left long enough in the

slowfurnace to pick up a great deal of carbon from the coal. He pushed it into the hot coals for almost
its entire length, tasted the two water barrels to see which had been salted—the third was olive oil—
then took off his coat and shirt and chose a leather vest that would fit his chest. Most of these Tairen
fellows were not as large as he, but he found one that would do. Finding an apron was easier.
When he turned around, he saw the smith, still with his head down over his work, nodding and
smiling to himself. But just because he knew his way around a smithy did not mean he had any skill at
smithing. That was yet to be shown.
When he came back to the anvil with two hammers, a set of long-handled flat-tongs, and a sharptopped hardy, the steel bar had heated to a dark red except for a small bit of what he had left out of
the coals. He worked the bellows, watching the color of the metal lighten, until it reached a yellow
just short of white. Then he pulled it out with the tongs, laid it on the anvil, and picked up the heavier
of the two hammers. About ten pounds, he estimated, and with a longer handle than most people, who
did not know metal working, thought was necessary. He held it near the end; hot metal gave off
sparks, sometimes, and he had seen the scars on the hands of the smith from up at Roundhill, a
careless fellow.
He did not want to make anything elaborate or fancy. Simple things seemed best at the moment.
He began by rounding the edges of the bar, then hammered the middle out into a broad blade, almost
as thick as the original at the butt, but a good hand and a half long. From time to time he returned the
metal to the coals, to keep it at the pale yellow, and after a time he shifted to the lighter hammer, half
the weight of the first. The piece beyond the blade, he thinned down, then bent it over the anvil horn in
a curve down beside the blade. A wooden handle could be fixed onto that, eventually. Setting the
sharp-chisel hardy in the anvil’s hardy-hole, he laid the glowing metal atop it. One sharp blow of the
hammer cut off the tool he had made. Or almost made. It would be a chamfer knife, for smoothing and
leveling the tops of barrel staves after they were hopped together, among other things. When he was
done. The other man’s barrel scrape had made him think of it.
As soon as he had made the hot-cut, he tossed the glowing metal into the salted quenching barrel.
Unsalted gave a harder quench, for the hardest metal, while the oil gave the softest, for good knives.
And swords, he had heard, but he had never had any part in making anything like that.
When the metal had cooled enough, to a dull gray, he removed it from the water and took it to the
grinding wheels. A little slow work with the footpedals ground a polish onto the blade. Carefully, he
heated the blade portion again. This time the colors deepened, to straw, to bronze. When the bronze
color began to run up the blade in waves, he set it aside to cool. The final edge could be sharpened
then. Quenching again would destroy the tempering he had just done.
“A very neat bit of work,” the smith said. “No wasted motion. You looking for work? My
apprentices just walked away, all three of them, the worthless fools, and I’ve plenty you could do.”
Perrin shook his head. “I do not know how long I will be in Tear. I’d like to work a little longer,
if you do not mind. It has been a long time, and I miss it. Maybe I could do some of the work your
apprentices would have done.”
The smith snorted loudly. “You’re a deal better than any of those louts, moping around and
staring, muttering about their nightmares. As if everyone doesn’t have nightmares, sometimes. Yes,
you can work here, as long as you want. Light, I’ve orders for a dozen drawknives and three cooper’s
adzes, and a carpenter down the street needs a mortise hammer, and. . . . Too much to list it. Start
with the drawknives, and we will see how far we get before night.”
Perrin lost himself in the work, for a time forgetting everything but the heat of the metal, the ring
of his hammer, and the smell of the forge, but there came a time when he looked up and found the

smith—Dermid Ajala, he had said his name was—taking off his vest, and the shoeing yard dark. All
the light came from the forge and a pair of lamps. And Zarine was sitting on an anvil by one of the
cold forges, watching him.
“So you really are a blacksmith, blacksmith,” she said.
“He is that, mistress,” Ajala said. “Apprentice, he says, but the work he did today amounts to his
master’s piece as far as I am concerned. Fine stroking, and better than steady.” Perrin shifted his feet
at the compliments, and the smith grinned at him. Zarine stared at both of them with a lack of
comprehension.
Perrin went to replace the vest and apron on their peg, but once he had them off, he was suddenly
conscious of Zarine’s eyes on his back. It was if she were touching him; for a moment, the herbal
scent of her seemed overwhelming. He quickly pulled his shirt over his head, stuffed it raggedly into
his breeches, and jerked on his coat. When he turned around, Zarine wore one of those small,
secretive smiles that had always made him nervous.
“Is this what you mean to do, then?” she asked. “Did you come all this way to be a blacksmith
again?” Ajala paused in the act of pulling the yard doors closed and listened.
Perrin picked up the heavy hammer he had used, a ten-pound head with a handle as long as his
forearm. It felt good in his hands. It felt right. The smith had glanced at his eyes once and never even
blinked; it was the work that was important, the skill with metal, not the color of a man’s eyes. “No,”
he said sadly. “One day, I hope. But not yet.” He started to hang the hammer back on the wall.
“Take it.” Ajala cleared his throat. “I do not usually give away good hammers, but. . . . The
work you’ve done today is worth more than the price of that hammer by far, and maybe it will help
you to that ‘one day.’ Man, if I have ever seen anyone made to hold a smith’s hammer, it is you. So
take it. Keep it.”
Perrin closed his hand around the haft. It did feel right. “Thank you,” he said. “I cannot say what
this means to me.”
“Just remember the ‘one day,’ man. Just you remember it.”
As they left, Zarine looked up at him and said, “Do you have any idea how strange men are,
blacksmith? No. I did not think you did.” She darted ahead, leaving him holding the hammer in one
hand and scratching his head with the other.
No one in the common room looked at him twice, a golden-eyed man carrying a smith’s hammer.
He went up to his room, remembering for once to light a tallow candle. His quiver and the axe hung
from the same peg on the plaster wall. He hefted the axe in one hand, the hammer in the other. By
weight of metal, the axe, with its half-moon blade and thick spike, was a good five or six pounds
lighter than the hammer, but it felt ten times heavier. Replacing the axe in the loop on its belt, he set
the hammer on the floor beneath the peg, handle against the wall. Axe haft and hammer haft almost
touched, two pieces of wood equally thick. Two pieces of metal, near enough the same weight. For a
long time he sat on the stool staring at them. He was still staring when Lan put his head into the room.
“Come, blacksmith. We have things to talk over.”
“I am a blacksmith,” Perrin said, and the Warder frowned at him.
“Don’t go winter-crazy on me now, blacksmith. If you cannot carry your weight any longer, you
may drag us all down the mountain.”
“I’ll carry my weight,” Perrin growled. “I will do what has to be done. What do you want?”
“You, blacksmith. Don’t you listen? Come on, farmboy.”
That name that Zarine so often called him pulled him to his feet angrily, now, but Lan was
already turning away. Perrin hurried into the hall and followed him toward the front of the inn,

meaning to tell the Warder he had had enough of this “blacksmith” and “farmboy,” his name was
Perrin Aybara. The Warder ducked into the inn’s only private dining room, overlooking the street.
Perrin followed him. “Now listen, Warder, I—”
“You listen, Perrin,” Moiraine said. “Be quiet and listen.” Her face was smooth, but her eyes
looked as grim as her voice sounded.
Perrin had not realized anyone was in the room except for himself and the Warder, standing with
one arm up on the mantel of the unlit fireplace. Moiraine sat at the table in the middle of the floor, a
simple piece, of black oak. None of the other chairs with their high, carved backs were occupied.
Zarine was leaning against the wall at the other end of the room from Lan, scowling, and Loial had
chosen to sit on the floor since none of the chairs really fit him.
“I’m glad you decided to join us, farmboy,” Zarine said sarcastically. “Moiraine would not say
anything till you came. She just looks at us as if she is deciding which of us is going to die. I—”
“Be quiet,” Moiraine told her sharply. “One of the Forsaken is in Tear. The High Lord Samon is
Be’lal.” Perrin shivered.
Loial squeezed his eyes shut and groaned. “I could have remained in the stedding. I would
probably have been very happy, married, whoever my mother chose. She is a fine woman, my mother,
and she would not give me to a bad wife.” His ears seemed to have hidden themselves completely in
his shaggy hair.
“You can go back to Stedding Shangtai,” Moiraine said. “Leave now, if you wish. I will not stop
you.”
Loial opened one eye. “I can go?”
“If you wish,” she said.
“Oh.” He opened the other eye, and scratched his cheek with blunt fingers the size of sausages.
“I suppose. . . . I suppose . . . if I have a choice . . . that I will stay with all of you. I have taken a great
many notes, but not nearly enough to complete my book, and I would not like to leave Perrin, and
Rand—”
Moiraine cut him off in a cold voice. “Good, Loial. I am glad that you are staying. I will be glad
to use any knowledge you have. But until this is done, I have no time to listen to your complaints!”
“I suppose,” Zarine said in an unsteady voice, “that there is no chance of me leaving?” She
looked at Moiraine, and shivered. “I thought not. Blacksmith, if I live through this, I will make you
pay.”
Perrin stared at her. Me! The fool woman thinks it my fault? Did I ask her to come? He opened
his mouth, saw the look in Moiraine’s eyes, and closed it again quickly. After a moment he said, “Is
he after Rand? To stop him, or kill him?”
“I think not,” she said quietly. Her voice was like cold steel. “I fear he means to let Rand enter
the Heart of the Stone and take Callandor, then take it away from him. I fear he means to kill the
Dragon Reborn with the very weapon that is meant to herald him.”
“Do we run again?” Zarine said. “Like Illian? I never thought to run, but I never thought to find
the Forsaken when I took the Hunter’s oath.”
“This time,” Moiraine said, “we do not run. We dare not run. Worlds and time rest on Rand, on
the Dragon Reborn. This time, we fight.”
Perrin took a chair uneasily. “Moiraine, you are saying a lot of things right out that you told us
we must not even think about. You do have this room warded against listening, don’t you?” When she
shook her head, he gripped the edge of the table hard enough to make the dark oak creak.
“I do not speak of a Myrddraal, Perrin. No one knows the strength of the Forsaken, except that

Ishamael and Lanfear were the strongest, but the weakest of them could sense any warding I might set
from a mile or more away. And rip all of us to shreds in seconds. Possibly without stirring from
where he stood.”
“You’re saying he can tie you in knots,” Perrin muttered. “Light! What are we supposed to do?
How can we do anything?”
“Even the Forsaken cannot stand up to balefire,” she said. He wondered if that was what she had
used on the Darkhounds; it still made him uneasy, what he had seen, and what she had said then. “I
have learned things in the last year, Perrin. I am . . . more dangerous than when I came to Emond’s
Field. If I can come close enough to Be’lal, I can destroy him. But if he sees me first, he can destroy
us all, long before I have a chance.” She turned her attention to Loial. “What can you tell me of
Be’lal?”
Perrin blinked in confusion. Loial?
“Why are you asking him?” Zarine burst out angrily. “First you tell the blacksmith you mean us to
fight one of the Forsaken!—who can kill us all before we can even think!—and now you ask Loial
about him?” Loial murmured urgently, that name she used—“Faile! Faile!”—but she did not even
slow. “I thought Aes Sedai knew everything. Light, at least I am smart enough not to say I will fight
someone unless I know everything I can of him! You. . . .” She trailed off under Moiraine’s stare,
muttering.
“Ogier,” the Aes Sedai said coolly, “have long memories, girl. It has been well over a hundred
generations since the Breaking for humans, but less than thirty for Ogier. We still learn things from
their stories that we did not know. Now tell me, Loial. What do you know of Be’lal. And briefly, for
once. I want your long memory, not your long wind.”
Loial cleared his throat, a sound much like firewood tumbling down a chute. “Be’lal.” His ears
flickered out of his hair like hummingbird wings, then snapped down again. “I do not know what can
be in the stories about him you do not already know. He is not much mentioned, except in the razing of
the Hall of the Servants just before Lews Therin Kinslayer and the Hundred Companions sealed him
up with the Dark One. Jalanda son of Aried son of Coiam wrote that he was called the Envious, that
he forsook the Light because he envied Lews Therin, and that he envied Ishamael and Lanfear, too. In
A Study of the War of the Shadow, Moilin daughter of Hamada daughter of Juendan called Be’lal the
Netweaver, but I do not know why. She mentioned him playing a game of stones with Lews Therin
and winning, and that he always boasted of it.” He glanced at Moiraine and rumbled, “I am trying to
be brief. I do not know anything important about him. Several writers say Be’lal and Sammael were
both leaders in the fight against the Dark One before they forsook the Light, and both were masters of
the sword. That is truly all I know. He may be mentioned in other books, other stories, but I have not
read them. Be’lal is just not spoken of very often. I am sorry I could not tell you anything useful.”
“Perhaps you have,” Moiraine told him. “I did not know of the name, the Netweaver. Or that he
envied the Dragon as well as his companions in the Shadow. That strengthens my belief that he wants
Callandor. That must be the reason he has chosen to make himself a High Lord of Tear. And the
Netweaver—a name for a schemer, a patient and cunning planner. You have done well, Loial.” For a
moment the Ogier’s wide mouth curved up in a pleased smile, but then it curved down again.
“I will not pretend I am not afraid,” Zarine said suddenly. “Only a fool would not be afraid of
the Forsaken. But I swore I would be one of you, and I will. That is all that I wanted to say.”
Perrin shook his head. She must be crazy. I could wish I were not one of this party. I could
wish I were back home working Master Luhhan’s forge . Aloud, he said, “If he is inside the Stone, if
he is waiting there for Rand, we must go inside to reach him. How do we do that? Everyone keeps

saying no one enters the Stone without the permission of the High Lords, and looking at it, I don’t see
any way but through the gates.”
“You do not go in,” Lan said. “Moiraine and I will be the only ones to enter. The more who go,
the harder it will be. Whatever way in I find, I cannot believe it will be easy even for only two.”
“Gaidin,” Moiraine began in a firm voice, but the Warder cut her off with one just as firm.
“We go together, Moiraine. I will not stand aside this time.” After a moment she nodded. Perrin
thought he saw Lan relax. “The rest of you had better get some sleep,” the Warder went on. “I have to
be out studying the Stone.” He paused. “There is a thing that your news drove out of my head,
Moiraine. A small thing, and I cannot see what it might mean. There are Aiel in Tear.”
“Aiel!” Loial exclaimed. “Impossible! The entire city would be in a panic if one Aiel came
through the gates.”
“I did not say they were walking the streets, Ogier. The rooftops and chimneys of the city make
as good hiding as the Waste. I saw no less than three, though apparently no one else in Tear has seen
any of them. And if I saw three, you can be sure there are many times that I did not see.”
“It means nothing to me,” Moiraine said slowly. “Perrin, why are you frowning in that way?”
He had not known that he was frowning. “I was thinking about that Aiel in Remen. He said that
when the Stone falls, the Aiel will leave the Three-fold Land. That’s the Waste, isn’t it? He said it
was a prophecy.”
“I have read every word of the Prophecies of the Dragon,” Moiraine said softly, “in every
translation, and there is no mention of the Aiel. We stagger blindly while Be’lal weaves his nets, and
the Wheel weaves the Pattern around us. But are the Aiel the Wheel’s weaving, or Be’lal’s? Lan, you
must find me the way into the Stone quickly. Us. Find us a way in quickly.”
“As you command, Aes Sedai,” he said, but his tone was more warm than formal. He vanished
through the door. Moiraine frowned at the table, eyes clouded in thought.
Zarine came over to look down at Perrin, her head tilted to one side. “And what are you going to
do, blacksmith? It seems they mean us to wait and watch while they go adventuring. Not that I will
complain.”
He doubted that last. “First,” he told her, “I am going to have something to eat. And then I am
going to think about a hammer.” And try to puzzle out how I feel about you. Falcon.

CHAPTER
51

Bait for the Net

From the corner of her eye, Nynaeve thought she glimpsed a tall man with reddish hair, in a
swirling brown cloak, well down the sunlit street, but as she turned to peer from under the wide brim
of the blue straw hat Ailhuin had given her, an ox-drawn wagon was already lumbering between
them. When it lurched on, the man was nowhere to be seen. She was almost certain that had been a
wooden flute case on his back, and his clothes were certainly not Tairen. It couldn’t be Rand. Just
because I keep dreaming about him does not mean he is going to come all the way from Almoth
Plain.
One of the barefoot men hurrying past, with the sickle-shaped tails of a dozen large fish sticking
up from the basket on his back, suddenly tripped, catapulting silver-scaled fish over his head as he
fell. He landed on hands and knees in the mud, staring at the fish that had come out of his basket.
Every one of the long, sleek shapes stood upright, stuck nose down in the mud, forming a neat circle.
Even a few passersby gaped at that. Slowly the man got to his feet, apparently unaware of the mud on
him. Unslinging his basket, he began gathering the fish back into it, shaking his head and muttering to
himself.
Nynaeve blinked, but her business was with this cow-faced brigand, facing her in the doorway
of his shop with bloody cuts of meat hanging from hooks behind him. She gave her braid a tug and
fixed the fellow with her eye.
“Very well,” she said sharply, “I will take it, but if this is what you charge for so poor a cut,
you’ll not have more business from me.”
He shrugged placidly as he took her coins, then wrapped the fatty mutton roast in a cloth she
produced from the basket on her arm. She glared at him as she put the wrapped meat into the basket,
but that did not affect him.
She whirled to stalk away—and nearly fell. She was still not used to these clogs; they kept
sticking in the mud, and she could not see how the folk who wore them managed. She hoped this
sunshine dried the ground soon, but she had a feeling that the mud was more or less permanent in the
Maule.
Stepping gingerly, she started back toward Ailhuin’s house, muttering under her breath. The
prices were outrageous for everything, the quality inevitably poor, and almost no one seemed to care,
not the people buying or those selling. It was a relief to pass a woman shouting at a shopkeeper,
waving a bruised reddish-yellow fruit—Nynaeve did not know what; they had a good many fruits and
vegetables she had never heard of, here—in each hand and calling for everyone to see what refuse the
man sold, but the shopkeeper only stared at her wearily, not even bothering to argue back.
There was some excuse for the prices, she knew—Elayne had explained all about the grain
being eaten by rats in the granaries because no one in Cairhien could buy, and how big the Cairhienin

grain trade had become since the Aiel War—but nothing excused the way everyone seemed ready to
lie down and die. She had seen hail ruin food crops in the Two Rivers, and grasshoppers eat them
and blacktongue kill the sheep and redspot wither the tabac so there was nothing to sell when the
merchants came down from Baerlon. She could remember two years in a row when there had been
little to eat except turnip soup and old barley, and hunters had been lucky to bring home a scrawny
rabbit, but Two Rivers folk picked themselves up when they were knocked down and went back to
work. These people had had only one bad year, and their fisheries and their other trade seemed to be
flourishing. She had no patience with them. The trouble was, she knew she should have a little
patience. They were odd people with odd ways, and things she took for cringing, they seemed to see
as a matter of course, even Ailhuin and Sandar. She should be able to summon up just a little
patience.
If for them, why not for Egwene? She put that aside. The child behaved wretchedly, snapping at
the most obvious suggestions, objecting to the most sensible things. Even when it was plain what they
should do, Egwene wanted to be convinced. Nynaeve was not used to having to convince people,
especially not people she had changed swaddling clothes for. The fact that she was only a matter of
seven years older than Egwene was of no account.
It is all those bad dreams, she told herself. I cannot understand what they mean, and now
Elayne and I are having them, too, and I do not know what that means either, and Sandar won’t
say anything except that he is still looking, and I am so frustrated I . . . I could just spit! She jerked
her braid so hard it hurt. At least she had been able to convince Egwene not to use the ter’angreal
again, to put the thing back in her pouch instead of wearing it next to her skin always. If the Black
Ajah was in Tel’aran’rhiod. . . . She did not want to think about that possibility. We will find them!
“I will bring them down,” she muttered. “Trying to sell me like a sheep! Hunting me like an
animal! I am the hunter this time, not the rabbit! That Moiraine! If she had never come to Emond’s
Field, I could have taught Egwene enough. And Rand. . . . I could have . . . I could have done
something.” That she knew neither was true did not help; it made it worse. She hated Moiraine almost
as much as she hated Liandrin and the Black Ajah, maybe as much as she hated the Seanchan.
She rounded a corner, and Juilin Sandar had to leap out of her way to keep from being trampled.
Even used to them as he was, he nearly tripped over his own clogs, only his staff saving him from
falling on his face in the mud. That pale, ridged wood was called bamboo, she had learned, and it
was stronger than it looked.
“Mistress—uh—Mistress Maryim,” Sandar said, regaining his balance. “I was . . . looking for
you.” He flashed her a nervous smile. “Are you angry? Why are you frowning at me that way?”
She smoothed her forehead. “I was not frowning at you, Master Sandar. The butcher. . . . It does
not matter. Why are you looking for me?” Her breath caught. “Have you found them?”
He looked around as if he suspected the passersby of trying to listen. “Yes. Yes, you must come
back with me. The others are waiting. The others. And Mother Guenna.”
“Why are you so nervous? You did not let them discover your interest?” she said sharply. “What
has frightened you?”
“No! No, mistress. I—I did not reveal myself.” His eyes darted again, and he stepped closer, his
voice dropping to a breathy, urgent whisper. “These women you seek, they are in the Stone! Guests of
a High Lord! The High Lord Samon! Why did you call them thieves? The High Lord Samon!” he
almost squeaked. There was sweat on his face.
Inside the Stone! With a High Lord! Light, how do we reach them now? She suppressed her
impatience with an effort. “Be easy,” she said soothingly. “Be at ease, Master Sandar. We can

explain everything to your satisfaction.” I hope we can. Light, if he goes running to the Stone to tell
this High Lord we are searching for them. . . . “Come with me to Mother Guenna’s house. Joslyn,
Caryla, and I will explain it all to you. Truly. Come.”
He gave a short, uneasy nod, and walked alongside her, keeping his pace to what she could
manage with the clogs. He looked as if he wanted to run.
At the Wise Woman’s house, she hurried around to the back. No one ever used the front door,
that she had seen, not even Mother Guenna herself. The horses were tied to a bamboo hitching rail,
now—well away from Ailhuin’s new figs as well as her vegetables—with their saddles and bridles
stored inside. For once she did not stop to pat Gaidin’s nose and tell him he was a good boy, and
more sensible than his namesake. Sandar halted to scrape mud from his clogs with the butt of his staff,
but she hurried inside.
Ailhuin Guenna was sitting in one of her high-backed chairs pulled out into the room, her arms at
her sides. The gray-haired woman’s eyes were bulging with anger and fear, and she struggled
furiously without moving a muscle. Nynaeve did not need to sense the subtle weaving of Air to know
what had happened. Light, they’ve found us! Burn you, Sandar!
Rage flooded her, washed away the walls inside that usually kept her from the Power, and as the
basket fell from her hands, she was a white blossom on a blackthorn bush, opening to embrace
saidar, opening. . . . It was as if she had run into another wall, a wall of clear glass; she could feel the
True Source, but the wall stopped everything except the ache to be filled with the One Power.
The basket hit the floor, and as it bounced, the door behind her opened and Liandrin stepped in,
followed by a black-haired woman with a white streak above her left ear. They wore long, colorful
silk dresses cut to bare their shoulders, and the glow of saidar surrounded them.
Liandrin smoothed her red dress and smiled with that pouting rosebud mouth. Her doll’s face
was filled with amusement. “You see, do you not, wilder,” she began, “you have no—”
Nynaeve hit her in the mouth as hard as she could. Light, I have to get away. She backhanded
Rianna so hard the black-haired woman fell on her silk-covered rump with a grunt. They must have
the others, but if I can make it out the door, if I can get far enough away they can’t shield me, I
can do something. She pushed Liandrin hard, shoving her away from the door. Just let me escape
their shielding, and I’ll. . . .
Blows hit her from every side, like fists and sticks, pummeling her. Neither Liandrin, blood
trickling from a corner of her now-grim mouth, nor Rianna, her hair as disarrayed as her green dress,
lifted a hand. Nynaeve could feel the flows of Air weaving about her as well as she could feel the
blows themselves. She still struggled to reach the door, but she realized that she was on her knees,
now, and the unseen blows would not stop, invisible sticks and fists striking at her back and her
stomach, her head and her hips, her shoulders, her breasts, her legs, her head. Groaning, she fell onto
her side and curled into a ball, trying to protect herself. Oh, Light, I tried. Egwene! Elayne! I tried! I
will not cry out! Burn you, you can beat me to death, but I won’t cry!
The blows stopped, but Nynaeve could not stop quivering. She felt bruised and battered from
crown to toe.
Liandrin crouched beside her, arms around her knees, silk rustling against silk. She had wiped
the blood away from her mouth. Her dark eyes were hard, and there was no amusement on her face
now. “Perhaps you are too stupid to know when you are defeated, wilder. You fought almost as
wildly as that other foolish girl, that Egwene. She almost went mad. You must all learn to submit. You
will learn to submit.”
Nynaeve shivered and reached for saidar again. It was not that she had any real hope, but she

had to do something. Forcing through her pain, she reached out . . . and struck that invisible shield.
Liandrin did have amusement back in her eyes, now, the grim mirth of a nasty child who pulls the
wings off flies.
“We have no use for this one, at least,” Rianna said, standing beside Ailhuin. “I will stop her
heart.” Ailhuin’s eyes nearly came out of her head.
“No!” Liandrin’s short, honey-colored braids swung as her head snapped around. “Always you
kill too quickly, and only the Great Lord can make use of the dead.” She smiled at the woman held to
the chair by invisible bonds. “You saw the soldiers who came with us, old woman. You know who
waits for us in the Stone. The High Lord Samon, he will not be pleased if you speak of what happened
inside your house today. If you hold your tongue, you will live, perhaps to serve him again one day. If
you speak, you will serve only the Great Lord of the Dark, from beyond the grave. Which do you
choose?”
Suddenly Ailhuin could move her head. She shook her gray curls, working her mouth. “I. . . . I
will hold my tongue,” she said dejectedly, then gave Nynaeve an embarrassed, shamed look. “If I
speak, what good will it do? A High Lord could have my head by raising an eyebrow. What good can
I do you, girl? What good?”
“It is all right,” Nynaeve said wearily. Who could she tell? All she could do is die. “I know you
would help if you could.” Rianna threw back her head and laughed. Ailhuin slumped, released
completely, but she only sat there, staring at her hands in her lap.
Between them, Liandrin and Rianna pulled Nynaeve to her feet and pushed her toward the front
of the house. “You give us any trouble,” the black-haired woman said in a hard voice, “and I will
make you peel off your own skin and dance in your bones.”
Nynaeve almost laughed. What trouble could I give? She was shielded from the True Source.
Her bruises ached so much she could barely stand. Anything she might do, they could handle like a
child’s tantrum. But my bruises will heal, burn you, and you’ll make a slip yet! And when you do.
...
There were others in the front room of the house. Two big soldiers in rimmed, round helmets and
shiny breastplates over those puffy-sleeved red coats. The two men had sweat on their faces, and
their dark eyes rolled as if they were as afraid as she. Amico Nagoyin was there, slender and pretty
with her long neck and pale skin, looking as innocent as a girl gathering flowers. Joiya Byir had a
friendly face despite that smooth-cheeked calm of a woman who had worked long with the Power,
almost a grandmother’s face in its welcoming appearance, though her age had put no touch of gray in
her dark hair, any more than it had wrinkled her skin. Her gray eyes looked more like those of the
stepmother in the stories, the one who murdered the children of her husband’s first wife. Both women
shone with the Power.
Elayne stood between the two Black sisters, with a bruised eye and a swollen cheek and a split
lip, one sleeve of her dress torn halfway off. “I am sorry, Nynaeve,” she said thickly, as if her jaw
hurt. “We never saw them until it was too late.”
Egwene lay in a crumpled heap on the floor, her face swollen with bruises, almost
unrecognizable. As Nynaeve and her escort came in, one of the big soldiers hoisted Egwene over his
shoulder. She dangled there as limply as a half-empty barley sack.
“What did you do to her?” Nynaeve demanded. “Burn you, what—!” Something unseen struck
her across the mouth hard enough to make her eyes go blank for a moment.
“Now, now,” Joiya Byir said with a smile that her eyes belied. “I will not stand for demands, or
bad language.” She sounded like a grandmother, too. “You speak when you are spoken to.”

“I told you the girl, she would not stop fighting, yes?” Liandrin said. “Let it be a lesson to you. If
you try to cause any trouble, you will be treated no more gently.”
Nynaeve ached to do something for Egwene, but she let herself be pushed out into the street. She
made them push her; it was a small way of fighting back, refusing to cooperate, but it was all she had
at the moment.
There were few people in the muddy street, as if everyone had decided it was much better to be
somewhere else, and those few scurried by on the other side without a glance at the shiny, blacklacquered coach standing behind a team of six matched whites with tall white plumes on their bridles.
A coachman dressed like the soldiers, but without armor or sword, sat on the seat, and another
opened the door as they appeared from the house. Before he did, Nynaeve saw the sigil painted there.
A silver-gauntleted fist clutching jagged lightning bolts.
She supposed it was High Lord Samon’s sign—A Darkfriend, he must be, if he deals with the
Black Ajah. The Light burn him!—but she was more interested in the man who dropped to his knees
in the mud at their appearance. “Burn you, Sandar, why—?” She jumped as something that felt like a
stick of wood struck her across the shoulders.
Joiya Byir smiled chidingly and waggled a finger. “You will be respectful, child. Or you might
lose that tongue.”
Liandrin laughed. Tangling a hand in Sandar’s black hair, she wrenched his head back. He stared
up at her with the eyes of a faithful hound—or of a cur expecting a kick. “Do not be too hard on this
man.” She even made “man” sound like “dog.” “He had to be . . . persuaded . . . to serve. But I am
very good at persuading, no?” She laughed again.
Sandar turned a confused stare on Nynaeve. “I had to do it, Mistress Maryim. I . . . had to.”
Liandrin twisted his hair, and his eyes went back to her, the anxious hound’s once more.
Light! Nynaeve thought. What did they do to him? What are they going to do to us?
She and Elayne were bundled roughly into the coach, with Egwene slumped between them, her
head lolling, and Liandrin and Rianna climbed in and took the seat facing forward. The glow of
saidar still surrounded them. Where the others went, Nynaeve did not much care at that moment. She
wanted to reach Egwene, to touch her, to comfort her hurts, but she could not move a muscle below
her neck except to writhe. Flows of Air bound the three of them like layers of tightly wrapped
blankets. The coach lurched into motion, swaying hard in the mud despite its leather springs.
“If you have hurt her. . . .” Light, I can see they’ve hurt her. Why don’t I say what I mean? But
it was almost as hard to force the words out as it would have been to lift a hand. “If you have killed
her, I won’t rest till you are all hunted down like wild dogs.”
Rianna glared, but Liandrin only sniffed. “Do not be a complete fool, wilder. You are wanted
alive. Dead bait will catch nothing.”
Bait? For what? For who? “You are the fool, Liandrin! Do you think we are here alone? Only
three of us, and not even full Aes Sedai? We are bait, Liandrin. And you have walked into the trap
like a fat grouse.”
“Do not tell her that!” Elayne said sharply, and Nynaeve blinked before she realized Elayne was
helping her fabrication. “If you let your anger get the best of you, you will tell them what they must not
hear. They must take us inside the Stone. They must—”
“Be quiet!” Nynaeve snapped. “You are letting your tongue run away with you!” Elayne
managed to look abashed behind her bruises. Let them chew on that, Nynaeve thought.
But Liandrin only smiled. “Once your time as bait is done, you will tell us everything. You will
want to. They say you will be very strong one day, but I will make sure you will always obey me,

even before the Great Master Be’lal works his plans for you. He is sending for Myrddraal. Thirteen
of them.” Those rosebud lips laughed the final words.
Nynaeve felt her stomach twist. One of the Forsaken! Her brain numbed with shock. The Dark
One and all the Forsaken are bound in Shayol Ghul, bound by the Creator in the moment of
creation. But the catechism did not help; she knew too well how much of it was false. Then the rest of
it came home to her. Thirteen Myrddraal. And thirteen sisters of the Black Ajah. She heard Elayne
screaming before she realized she was screaming herself, jerking uselessly in those invisible bonds
of Air. It was impossible to say which was louder, their despairing screams, or the laughter from
Liandrin and Rianna.

In Search of a Remedy

Slumped on the stool in the gleeman’s room, Mat grimaced as Thom coughed again. How are
we going to keep looking if he’s so bloody sick he can’t walk? He was ashamed as soon as he
thought it. Thom had been as assiduous in searching as he had, pushing himself day and night, when he
had to know he was coming down sick. Mat had been so absorbed in his hunt that he had paid too
little attention to Thom’s coughing. The change from constant rain to steamy heat had not helped it.
“Come on, Thom,” he said. “Lopar says there’s a Wise Woman not far. That is what they call a
Wisdom here—a Wise Woman. Wouldn’t Nynaeve like that!”
“I do not need . . . any foul-tasting . . . concoctions . . . poured down my throat, boy.” Thom
stuffed a fist through his mustaches in a vain attempt to stop his hacking. “You go ahead looking. Just
give me . . . a few hours . . . on my bed . . . and I’ll join you.” The wracking wheezes doubled him
over till his head was almost on his knees.
“So I am supposed to do all the work while you take your ease?” Mat said lightly. “How can I
find anything without you? You learn most of what we hear.” That was not exactly true; men talked as
freely over dice as they did while buying a gleeman a cup of wine. More freely than they did with a
gleeman hacking so hard they feared contagion. But he was beginning to think that Thom’s cough was
not going to go away by itself. If the old goat dies on me, who will I play stones with? he told
himself roughly. “Anyway, your bloody coughing keeps me awake even in the next room.”
Ignoring the white-haired man’s protests, he pulled Thom to his feet. He was shocked at how
much of the gleeman’s weight he had to support. Despite the damp heat, Thom insisted on his patchcovered cloak. Mat had his own coat unbuttoned completely and all three ties of his shirt undone, but
he let the old goat have his way. No one in the common room even looked up as he half carried Thom
out into the muggy afternoon.
The innkeeper had given simple directions, but when they reached the gate, and faced the mud of
the Maule, Mat almost turned back to ask after another Wise Woman. There had to be more than one
in a city this size. Thom’s wheezing decided him. With a grimace Mat stepped off into the mud, half
carrying the gleeman.
He had thought from the directions that they must have passed the Wise Woman’s house on their
way up from the dock that first night, and when he saw the long, narrow house with bunches of herbs
hanging in the windows, right next to a potter’s shop, he remembered it. Lopar had said something
about going to the back door, but he had had enough of mud.
And the stink of fish, he thought, frowning at the barefoot men squelching by with their baskets
on their backs. There were tracks of horses in the street, too, just beginning to be obliterated by feet
and ox-carts. Horses pulling a wagon, or maybe a carriage. He had seen nothing but oxen drawing

carts or wagons either one in Tear—the nobles and the merchants were proud of their fine stock, and
never let one be put to anything like work—but he had not seen any carriages since leaving the walled
city, either.
Dismissing horses and wheel tracks from his mind, he took Thom to the front door and knocked.
After a time he knocked again. Then again.
He was on the point of giving up and returning to The White Crescent despite Thom coughing on
his shoulder when he heard shuffling footsteps inside.
The door opened barely more than a crack, and a stout, gray-haired woman peered out. “What do
you want?” she asked in a tired voice.
Mat put on his best grin. Light, but I am getting sick myself at all these people who sound like
there’s no bloody hope . “Mother Guenna? My name is Mat Cauthon. Cavan Lopar told me you might
do something for my friend’s cough. I can pay well.”
She studied them a moment, seemed to listen to Thom’s wheezes, then sighed. “I suppose I can
still do that, at least. You might as well come in.” She swung the door open and was already plodding
toward the back of the house before Mat moved.
Her accent sounded so much like the Amyrlin’s that he shivered, but he followed, all but
carrying Thom.
“I don’t . . . need this,” the gleeman wheezed. “Bloody mixtures . . . always taste like . . . dung!”
“Shut up, Thom.”
Leading them all the way to the kitchen, the stout woman rummaged in one of the cupboards,
taking out small stone pots and packets of herbs while muttering to herself.
Mat sat Thom down in one of the high-backed chairs, and glanced through the nearest window.
There were three good horses tied out back; he was surprised the Wise Woman had more than one, or
any for that matter. He had not seen anyone in Tear riding except nobles and the wealthy, and these
animals looked as if they had cost more than a little silver. Horses again. I don’t care about bloody
horses now!
Mother Guenna brewed some sort of strong tea with a rank smell and forced it down Thom’s
throat, holding his nose when he tried to complain. Mat decided she had less fat on her than he had
thought, from the way she held the gleeman’s head steady in the crook of one arm while she poured
the black liquid into him no matter how hard he tried to stop her.
When she took the cup away, Thom coughed and scrubbed at his mouth with equal vigor.
“Gaaah! Woman . . . I don’t know . . . whether you . . . mean to drown me . . . or kill me . . . with the
taste! You ought . . . to be a bloody . . . blacksmith!”
“You will take the same twice a day till that hacking is gone,” she said firmly. “And I have a
salve that you’ll rub on your chest every night.” Some of the weariness left her voice as she
confronted the gleeman, fists on her broad hips. “That salve stinks as bad as this tea tastes, but you
will rub it on—thoroughly!—or I’ll drag you upstairs like a scrawny carp in a net and tie you to a bed
with that cloak of yours! I never had a gleeman come to me before, and I’ll not let the first one that
does cough himself to death.”
Thom glowered and blew out his mustaches with a cough, but he seemed to take her threat
seriously. At least, he did not say anything, but he looked as if he meant to throw her tea and her salve
right back at her.
The more this Mother Guenna talked, the more she sounded like the Amyrlin to Mat. From the
sour look on Thom’s face, and the steady stare on hers, he decided he had better smooth matters over
a little before the gleeman refused to take her medicines. And she decided to make him. “I knew a

woman once who talked like you,” he said. “All fish and nets and things. Sounded like you, too. The
same accent, I mean. I suppose she’s Tairen.”
“Perhaps.” The gray-haired woman suddenly sounded tired again, and she kept staring at the
floor. “I knew some girls with the sound of your speech on their tongues, too. Two of them had it,
anyway.” She sighed heavily.
Mat felt his scalp prickle. My luck can’t be this good. But he would not bet a copper on two
other women with Two Rivers accents just happening to be in Tear. “Three girls? Young women?
Named Egwene, and Nynaeve, and Elayne? That one has hair like the sun, and blue eyes.”
She frowned at him. “Those were not the names they gave,” she said slowly, “yet I suspected
they did not give me their true names. But they had their reasons, I thought. One of them was a pretty
girl with bright blue eyes and red-gold hair to her shoulders.” She described Nynaeve with her braid
to her waist and Egwene with her big, dark eyes and ready smile, too. Three pretty women as
different from one another as they could be. “I see they are the ones you know,” she finished. “I am
sorry, boy.”
“Why are you sorry? I have been trying to find them for days!” Light, I walked right past this
place the first night! Right past them! I wanted random. What could be more random than where a
ship docks on a rainy night, and where you happen to look in a bloody lightning flash? Burn me!
Burn me! “Tell me where they are, Mother Guenna.”
The gray-haired woman stared wearily at the stove where her spouted kettle was steaming. Her
mouth worked, but she said nothing.
“Where are they?” Mat demanded. “It is important! They are in danger if I don’t find them.”
“You do not understand,” she said softly. “You are an outlander. The High Lords. . . .”
“I do not care about any—” Mat blinked, and looked at Thom. The gleeman seemed to be
frowning, but he was coughing so hard, Mat could not be sure. “What do the High Lords have to do
with my friends?”
“You just do not—”
“Don’t tell me I do not understand! I will pay for the information!”
Mother Guenna glared at him. “I do not take money for . . . !” She grimaced fiercely. “You ask
me to tell you things I have been told not to speak of. Do you know what will happen to me if I do and
you breathe my name? I will lose my tongue, to begin. Then I will lose other parts before the High
Lords have what is left of me hung up to scream its last hours as a reminder to others to obey. And it
will do those young women no good, not my telling or my dying!”
“I promise I will never mention your name to anyone. I swear it.” And I’ll keep that oath, old
woman, if you only tell me where they bloody are! “Please? They are in danger.”
She studied him for a long time; before she was done he had the feeling she knew every detail of
him. “On that oath, I will tell you. I . . . liked them. But you can do nothing. You are too late, Matrim
Cauthon. Too late by nearly three hours. They have been taken to the Stone. The High Lord Samon
sent for them.” She shook her head in worried puzzlement. “He sent . . . women who . . . could
channel. I hold nothing against Aes Sedai myself, but that is against the law. The law the High Lords
made. If they break every other law, they would not break that one. Why would a High Lord send Aes
Sedai on his errands? Why would he want those girls at all?”
Mat almost burst out laughing. “Aes Sedai? Mother Guenna, you had my heart in my throat, and
maybe my liver, too. If Aes Sedai came for them, there is nothing to worry about. All three of them
are going to be Aes Sedai themselves. Not that I like it much, but that’s what they—” His grin faded at
the heavy way she shook her head.

“Boy, those girls fought like lionfish in a net. Whether they mean to be Aes Sedai or not, those
who took them treated them like bilge pumpings. Friends do not give bruises like that.”
He felt his face twisting. Aes Sedai hurt them? What in the Light? The bloody Stone. It makes
the Palace in Caemlyn look like walking into a barnyard! Burn me! I stood right out there in the
rain and stared at this house! Burn me for a bloody Light-blinded fool!
“If you break your hand,” Mother Guenna said, “I will splint and poultice it, but if you damage
my wall, I will strip your hide like a redfish!”
He blinked, then looked at his fist, at scraped knuckles. He did not even remember punching the
wall.
The broad woman took his hand in a strong grip, but the fingers she used to probe were
surprisingly gentle. “Nothing broken,” she grunted after a while. Her eyes were just as gentle as she
studied his face. “It seems you care for them. One of them, at least, I suppose it is. I am sorry, Mat
Cauthon.”
“Don’t be,” he told her. “At least I know where they are, now. All I have to do is get them out.”
He fished out his last two Andoran gold crowns and pressed them into her hand. “For Thom’s
medicines, and for letting me know about the girls.” On impulse, he gave her a quick kiss on the cheek
and a grin. “And that’s for me.”
Startled, she touched her cheek, not seeming to know whether to look at the coins or at him. “Get
them out, you say. Just like that. Out of the Stone.” Abruptly she stabbed him in the ribs with a finger
as hard as a tree stub. “You remind me of my husband, Mat Cauthon. He was a headstrong fool who
would sail into the teeth of a gale and laugh, too. I could almost think you’ll manage it.” Suddenly she
saw his muddy boots, apparently for the first time. “It took me six months to teach him not to track
mud into my house. If you do get those girls out, whichever of them you have your eye on will have a
hard time training you to make you fit to be let inside.”
“You are the only woman who could do that,” he said with a grin that broadened at her glare.
Get them out. That’s all I have to do. Bring them right out of the Stone of bloody Tear. Thom
coughed again. He isn’t going into the Stone like that. Only, how do I stop him? “Mother Guenna,
can I leave my friend here? I think he is too sick to go back to the inn.”
“What?” Thom barked. He tried to push himself out of the chair, coughing so he could hardly
speak. “I am no . . . such thing, boy! You think . . . walking into the Stone . . . will be like . . . walking
into your mother’s kitchen? You think you . . . would make it . . . as far as the gates . . . without me?”
He hung on the back of the chair, his wheezing and hacking keeping him from rising more than
halfway to his feet.
Mother Guenna put a hand on his shoulder and pushed him back down as easily as a child. The
gleeman gave her a startled look. “I will take care of him, Mat Cauthon,” she said.
“No!” Thom shouted. “You cannot . . . do this to me! You can’t . . . leave me . . . with this old.
. . .” Only her hand on his shoulder kept him from doubling over.
Mat grinned at the white-haired man. “I have enjoyed knowing you, Thom.”
As he hurried out into the street, he found himself wondering why he had said that. He isn’t
going to bloody die. That woman will keep him alive if she has to drag him kicking and screaming
out of his grave by his mustaches. Yes, but who is going to keep me alive?
Ahead of him, the Stone of Tear loomed over the city, impregnable, a fortress besieged a
hundred times, a stone on which a hundred armies had broken their teeth. And he had to get inside,
somehow.
And bring out three women. Somehow. With a laugh that made even the sullen folk in the street

look at him, he headed back for The White Crescent, uncaring of mud or the damp heat. He could feel
the dice tumbling inside his head.

A Flow of the Spirit

Perrin shrugged into his coat as he walked back toward the Star through the evening shadows.
A good tiredness soaked through his arms and shoulders; along with more common work, Master
Ajala had had him make a large piece of ornamental work, all elaborate curves and scrolls, to go on
some country lord’s new gate. He had enjoyed making something so pretty.
“I thought his eyes would come out of his face, blacksmith, when you said you would not make
that thing if it was for a High Lord.”
He glanced sideways at Zarine, walking beside him, the shadows masking her face. Even for his
eyes, the shadows were there, just fainter than they would have been for another’s. They emphasized
her high cheekbones, softened the strong curve of her nose. He just could not make up his mind about
her. Even if Moiraine and Lan still insisted they stay close to the inn, he wished she could find
something else to do besides watch him work. For some reason, he had found himself growing
awkward whenever he thought of her tilted eyes on him. More than once he had fumbled with his
hammer till Master Ajala frowned at him wonderingly. Girls had always been able to make him feel
awkward especially when they smiled at him, but Zarine did not have to smile. Only look. He
wondered again if she was the beautiful woman Min had warned him against. Better if she is the
falcon. That thought surprised him so much that he stumbled.
“I did not want anything I make to get into the hands of one of the Forsaken.” His eyes glowed
golden as he looked at her. “If it was for a High Lord, how could I tell where it might end?” She
shivered. “I did not mean to frighten you, Fai—Zarine.”
She smiled broadly, no doubt thinking he could not see her. “You will fall yet, farmboy. Have
you ever thought of wearing a beard?”
It is bad enough she’s always mocking me, but half the time I do not even understand her!
As they reached the front door of the inn, Moiraine and Lan met them, coming the other way.
Moiraine wore that linen cloak with the wide, deep hood that hid her face. Light from the commonroom windows made yellow pools on the paving stones. Two or three carriages rumbled past, and
there were perhaps a dozen people in sight, hurrying home for their suppers, but for the most part,
shadows populated the street. The weaver’s shop was closed tight. The silence was deafening.
“Rand is in Tear.” The Aes Sedai’s cool voice issued from the depths of her hood as from a
cavern.
“Are you sure?” Perrin asked. “I have not heard of anything strange happening. No weddings, or
wells drying up.” He saw Zarine frown in confusion. Moiraine had not been forthcoming with her,
and neither had he. Keeping Loial’s tongue silent had been more difficult.
“Don’t you listen to rumors, blacksmith?” the Warder said. “There have been marriages, as
many in the last four days as in half a year before. And as many murders as in a whole year. A child

fell from a tower balcony today. A hundred paces onto stone paving. She got up and ran to her mother
without a bruise. The First of Mayene, a ‘guest’ in the Stone since before the winter, announced today
that she will submit to the will of the High Lords, after saying yesterday she would see Mayene and
all its ships burn before one Tairen country lord set foot in the city. They had not brought themselves
to torture her, and that young woman has a will like iron, so you tell me if you think it might be Rand’s
doing. Blacksmith, from top to bottom, Tear bubbles like a cauldron.”
“These things were not needed to tell me,” Moiraine said. “Perrin, did you dream of Rand last
night?”
“Yes,” he admitted. “He was in the Heart of the Stone, holding that sword”—he felt Zarine shift
beside him—“but I have been worrying about that so much it is no wonder I dream of it. I had nothing
but nightmares last night.”
“A tall man?” Zarine said. “With reddish hair and gray eyes? Holding something that shines so
brightly it hurts your eyes? In a place that is all great redstone columns? Blacksmith, tell me that was
not your dream.”
“You see,” Moiraine said. “I have heard this dream spoken of a hundred times today. They all
speak of nightmares—Be’lal apparently does not care to shield his dreams—but that one above all
else.” She laughed suddenly, like low, cool chimes. “People say he is the Dragon Reborn. They say
he is coming. They whisper it fearfully in corners, but they say it.”
“And what of Be’lal?” Perrin asked.
Moiraine’s reply was cold-drawn steel. “I will deal with him tonight.” There was no fear scent
from her.
“We will deal with him tonight,” Lan told her.
“Yes, my Gaidin. We will deal with him.”
“And what do we do? Sit here and wait? I had enough waiting to last me a lifetime in the
mountains, Moiraine.”
“You and Loial—and Zarine—will go to Tar Valon,” she told him. “Until this is done. It will be
the safest place for you.”
“Where is the Ogier?” Lan said. “I want all three of you on your way north as soon as possible.”
“Upstairs, I suppose,” Perrin said. “In his room, or maybe the dining room. There are lights in
the windows up there. He is always working on those notes of his. I suppose he will have plenty to
say in his book about us running away.” He was surprised at the bitterness in his voice. Light, fool,
do you want to face one of the Forsaken? No. No, but I am tired of running. I remember not
running, once. I remember fighting back, and it was better. Even if I thought I was going to die, it
was better.
“I will find him,” Zarine announced. “I have no shame in admitting I will be glad enough to run
from this fight. Men fight when they should run, and fools fight when they should run. But I had no
need to say it twice.” She strode ahead of them, her narrow, divided skirts making small whisking
noises as they entered the inn.
Perrin glanced around the common room as they followed her toward the stairs in the back.
There were fewer men at the tables than he expected. Some sat alone, with dull eyes, but where two
or three sat together they talked in frightened whispers his ears could barely catch. Even so, he heard
“Dragon” three times.
As he reached the top of the stairs, he heard another soft sound, a thump as of something falling
in the private dining room. He peered that way along the hall. “Zarine?” There was no answer. He
felt the hair on the back of his neck shift, and padded that way. “Zarine?” He pushed open the door.

“Faile!”
She was lying on the floor near the table. As he started to rush into the room, Moiraine’s
commanding shout halted him.
“Stop, you fool! Stop, for your life!” She came along the hallway slowly, head turning as if she
were listening for something, or searching for something. Lan followed with his hand on his sword—
and a look in his eye as if he already knew steel would do no good. She came abreast of the door and
stopped. “Move back, Perrin. Move back!”
In agony he stared at Zarine. At Faile. She lay there as if lifeless. Finally he made himself step
back from the door, leaving it open, standing where he could see her. She looked as if she were dead.
He could not see her chest stir. He wanted to howl. Frowning, he worked his hand, the one he had
used to push the door into the room, opening and closing his fingers. It tingled sharply, as if he had
struck his elbow. “Aren’t you going to do anything, Moiraine? If you will not, I am going to her.”
“Stand still or you will go nowhere,” she said calmly. “What is that by her right hand? As if it
dropped from her grip when she fell. I cannot make it out.”
He glared at her, then peered into the room. “A hedgehog. It looks like a hedgehog carved out of
wood. Moiraine, tell me what is going on! What has happened? Tell me!”
“A hedgehog,” she murmured. “A hedgehog. Be silent, Perrin. I must think. I felt it trigger. I can
sense the residues of the flows woven to set it. Spirit. Pure Spirit, and nothing else. Almost nothing
uses pure flows of Spirit! Why does that hedgehog make me think of Spirit?”
“You felt what trigger, Moiraine? What was set? A trap?”
“Yes, a trap,” she said, irritation making tiny cracks in her cool serenity. “A trap meant for me. I
would have been first into that room if Zarine had not rushed ahead. Lan and I would surely have gone
there to plan and wait for supper. I will not wait on supper now. Be quiet, if you wish me to help the
girl at all. Lan! Bring me that innkeeper!” The Warder flowed away down the stairs.
Moiraine paced up and down in the hall, sometimes stopping to peer through the door from the
depths of her hood. Perrin could see no sign that Zarine lived. Her breast did not stir. He tried
listening for her heartbeat, but even for his ears it was impossible.
When Lan returned, shoving a frightened Jurah Haret ahead of him by the scruff of his fat neck,
the Aes Sedai rounded on the balding man. “You promised to keep this room for me, Master Haret.”
Her voice was as hard, as precise, as a skinning knife. “To allow not even a serving woman to enter
to clean unless I was present. Who did you let enter it, Master Haret? Tell me!”
Haret shook like a bowl of pudding. “O-only the t-two Ladies, mistress. T-they w-wished to
leave a surprise for you. I swear, mistress. T-they showed it t-to me. A little h-hedgehog. T-they said
you w-would be surprised.”
“I was surprised, innkeeper,” she said softly. “Leave me! And if you whisper a word of this,
even in your sleep, I will pull this inn down and leave only a hole in the ground.”
“Y-yes, mistress,” he whispered. “I swear it! I do swear!
“Go!”
The innkeeper fell to his knees in his haste to reach the stairs, and went scrambling down with
thumps that suggested he fell more than once as he ran.
“He knows I am here,” Moiraine told the Warder, “and he has found someone of the Black Ajah
to set his trap, yet perhaps he thinks I am caught in it. It was a tiny flash of the Power, but perhaps he
is strong enough to have sensed it.”
“Then he will not suspect we are coming,” Lan said quietly. He almost smiled.
Perrin stared at them, his teeth bared. “What about her?” he demanded. “What was done to her,

Moiraine? Is she alive? I cannot see her breathe!”
“She is alive,” Moiraine said slowly. “I cannot, I dare not, go close enough to her to tell much
beyond that, but she is alive. She . . . sleeps, in a way. As a bear sleeps in the winter. Her heart beats
so slowly you could count minutes between. Her breathing is the same. She sleeps.” Even from within
that hood, he could feel her eyes on him. “I fear she is not there, Perrin. Not in her body any longer.”
“What do you mean she is not in her body? Light! You don’t mean they . . . took her soul. Like
the Gray Men!” Moiraine shook her head, and he drew a relieved breath. His chest hurt as if he had
not breathed since she last spoke. “Then where is she, Moiraine?”
“I do not know,” she said. “I have a suspicion, but I do not know.”
“A suspicion, a hint, anything! Burn me, where?” Lan shifted at the roughness in his voice, but he
knew he would try to break the Warder like iron over a hardy if the man tried to stop him. “Where?”
“I know very little, Perrin.” Moiraine’s voice was like cold, unfeeling music. “I have
remembered the little I know of what connects a carved hedgehog with Spirit. The carving is a
ter’angreal last studied by Corianin Nedeal, the last Dreamer the Tower had. The Talent called
Dreaming is a thing of Spirit, Perrin. It is not a thing I have ever studied; my Talents lie in other ways.
I believe that Zarine has been trapped inside a dream, perhaps even the World of Dreams,
Tel’aran’rhiod. All that is her is inside that dream. All. A Dreamer sends only a part of herself. If
Zarine does not return soon, her body will die. Perhaps she will live on in the dream. I do not know.”
“There is too much you don’t know,” Perrin muttered. He peered into the room and wanted to
cry. Zarine looked so small, lying there, so helpless. Faile. I swear I will only call you Faile, ever
again. “Why don’t you do something!”
“The trap has been sprung, Perrin, but it is a trap that will still catch anyone who steps into that
room. I would not reach her side before it took me. And I have work I must do tonight.”
“Burn you, Aes Sedai! Burn your work! This World of Dreams? Is it like the wolf dreams? You
said these Dreamers sometimes saw wolves.”
“I have told you what I can,” she said sharply. “It is time for you to go. Lan and I must be on our
way to the Stone. There can be no waiting, now.”
“No.” He said it quietly, but when Moiraine opened her mouth, he raised his voice. “No! I will
not leave her!”
The Aes Sedai took a deep breath. “Very well, Perrin.” Her voice was ice; calm, smooth, cold.
“Remain if you wish. Perhaps you will survive this night. Lan!”
She and the Warder strode down the hall to their rooms. In moments they returned, Lan wearing
his color-changing cloak, and vanished down the stairs without another word to him.
He stared through the open door at Faile. I have to do something. If it is like the wolf dreams.
...
“Perrin,” came Loial’s deep rumble, “what is this about Faile?” The Ogier came striding down
the hall in his shirtsleeves, ink on his fingers and a pen in his hand. “Lan told me I had to go, and then
he said something about Faile, in a trap. What did he mean?”
Distractedly, Perrin told him what Moiraine had said. It might work. It might. It has to! He was
surprised when Loial growled.
“No! Perrin, it is not right! Faile was so free. It is not right to trap her!”
Perrin peered up at Loial’s face, and suddenly remembered the old stories that claimed Ogier
were implacable enemies. Loial’s ears had laid back along the sides of his head, and his broad face
was as hard as an anvil.
“Loial, I am going to try to help Faile. But I will be helpless myself while I do. Will you guard

my back?”
Loial raised those huge hands that held books so carefully, and his thick fingers curled as if to
crush stone. “None will pass me while I live, Perrin. Not Myrddraal or the Dark One himself.” He
said it like a simple statement of fact.
Perrin nodded, and looked through the door again. It has to work. I don’t care if Min warned
me against her or not! With a snarl he leaped toward Faile, stretching out his hand. He thought he
touched her ankle before he was gone.
Whether this dream of the trap was Tel’aran’rhiod or not, Perrin did not know, but he knew it
for the wolf dream. Rolling, grassy hills surrounded him, and scattered thickets. He saw deer
browsing at the edges of the trees, and a herd of some sort of running animal bounding across the
grass, like brown-striped deer, but with long, straight horns. The smells on the wind told him they
were good to eat, and other scents spoke of more good hunting all around him. This was the wolf
dream.
He was wearing the blacksmith’s long leather vest, he realized, with his arms bare. And there
was a weight at his side. He touched the axe belt, but it was not the axe hanging from its loop. He ran
his fingers over the head of the heavy smith’s hammer. It felt right.
Hopper alighted in front of him.
Again you come, like a fool. The sending was of a cub sticking its nose into a hollow tree trunk
to lap honey despite the bees stinging its muzzle and eyes. The danger is greater than ever, Young
Bull. Evil things walk the dream. The brothers and sisters avoid the mountains of stone the twolegs pile up, and almost fear to dream to one another. You must go!
“No,” Perrin said. “Faile is here, somewhere, trapped. I have to find her, Hopper. I have to!” He
felt a shifting inside him, something changing. He looked down at his curly-haired legs, his wide
paws. He was an even larger wolf than Hopper.
You are here too strongly! Every sending carried shock. You will die, Young Bull!
If I do not free the falcon, I do not care, brother.
Then we hunt, brother.
Noses to the wind, the two wolves ran across the plain, seeking the falcon.

CHAPTER
54

Into the Stone

The rooftops of Tear were no place for a sensible man to be in the night, Mat decided as he
peered into the moon shadows. A little more than fifty paces of broad street, or perhaps narrow plaza,
separated the Stone from his tiled roof, itself three stories above the paving stones. But when was I
ever sensible? The only people I ever met who were sensible all the time were so boring that
watching them could put you to sleep. Whether the thing was a street or a plaza, he had followed it
all the way around the Stone since nightfall; the only place it did not go was on the river side, where
the Erinin ran right along the foot of the fortress, and nothing interrupted it except the city wall. That
wall was only two houses to his right. So far, the top of the wall seemed the best path to the Stone, but
not one he would be overjoyed to take.
Picking up his quarterstaff and a small, wire-handled tin box, he moved carefully to a brick
chimney a little nearer the wall. The roll of fireworks—what had been the roll of fireworks before he
worked on it back in his room—shifted on his back. It was more of a bundle, now, all jammed
together as tight as he could make it, but still too big for carrying around rooftops in the dark. Earlier,
a slip of his foot because of the thing had sent a roof tile skittering over the edge, and roused the man
sleeping in a room below to bellow “thief!” and send him running. He hitched the bundle back into
position without thinking about it, and crouched in the shadows of the chimney. After a moment he set
the tin box down; the wire handle was beginning to grow uncomfortably warm.
It felt a little safer, studying the Stone from the shadows, but not much more encouraging. The
city wall was not nearly as thick as those he had seen in other places, in Caemlyn or Tar Valon, no
more than a pace wide, supported by great stone buttresses cloaked in darkness, now. A pace was
more than sufficient width for walking, of course, except that the fall to either side was nearly ten
spans. Through the dark, to hard pavement. But some of these bloody houses back right up against
it, I can make it to the top easily enough, and it bloody runs straight to the bloody Stone!
It did that, but that was no particular comfort. The sides of the Stone looked like cliffs. Eyeing
the height again, he told himself he should be able to climb it. Of course, I can. Just like those cliffs
in the Mountains of Mist. Over a hundred paces straight up before there was a battlement. There
must be arrowslits lower down, but he could not make them out in the night. And he could not squeeze
through an arrowslit. A hundred bloody paces. Maybe a hundred and twenty. Burn me, even Rand
would not try to climb that. But it was the one way in he had found. Every gate he had seen had been
shut tight and looked strong enough to stop a herd of bulls, not to mention the dozen or so soldiers
guarding very nearly every last one, in helmets and breastplates, and swords at their belts.
Suddenly he blinked, and squinted at the side of the Stone. There was some fool climbing it, just
visible as a moving shadow in the moonlight, and over halfway up already, with a drop of seventy
paces to the pavement under his feet. Fool, is he? Well, I’m as big a one, because I am going up,

too. Burn me, he’ll probably raise an alarm in there and get me caught. He could not see the
climber anymore. Who in the Light is he? What does it matter who he is? Burn me, but this is a
bloody way to win a wager. I’m going to want a kiss from all of them, even Nynaeve!
He shifted to peer toward the wall, trying to choose his spot to climb, and suddenly there was
steel across his throat. Without thinking, he knocked it away and swept the man’s feet out from under
him with his staff. Someone else kicked his own feet away and he fell almost on top of the man he had
knocked down. He rolled off onto the roof tiles, loosing the bundle of fireworks—If that falls into
the street, I’ll break their necks!—staff whirling; he felt it strike flesh, and a second time, heard
grunts. Then there were two blades at his throat.
He froze, arms outflung. The points of short spears, dull so they hardly caught the faint light of
the moon at all, pressed into his flesh just short of bringing blood. His eyes followed them up to the
faces of whoever was holding them, but their heads were shrouded, their faces veiled in black except
for their eyes, staring at him. Burn me, I have to run into real thieves! What happened to my luck?
He put on a grin, with plenty of teeth so they could see it in the moonlight. “I do not mean to
trouble you in your work, so if you let me go my way, I’ll let you go yours and say nothing.” The
veiled men did not move, and neither did their spears. “I want no more outcry than you. I’ll not betray
you.” They stood like statues, staring down at him. Burn me, I do not have time for this. Time to toss
the dice. For a chilling moment he thought the words in his head had been strange. He tightened his
grip on the quarterstaff, lying out to one side of him—and almost cried out when someone stepped
hard on his wrist.
He rolled his eyes to see who. Burn me for a fool, I forgot the one I fell on. But he saw another
shape moving behind the one standing on his wrist, and decided maybe it was as well he had not
managed to bring the staff into use after all.
It was a soft boot, laced to the knee, that rested on his arm. It tugged at his memory. Something
about a man met in mountains. He eyed the night-cloaked shape the rest of the way up, trying to make
out the cut and colors of his clothes—they seemed all shadow, colors that blended with the darkness
too well to see them clearly—past a long-bladed knife at the fellow’s waist, right up to the dark veil
across his face. A black-veiled face. Black-veiled.
Aiel! Burn me, what are bloody Aiel doing here! He had a sinking feeling in his stomach as he
remembered hearing that Aiel veiled themselves when they killed.
“Yes,” said a man’s voice, “we are Aiel.” Mat gave a start; he had not realized he had spoken
aloud.
“You dance well for one caught by surprise,” a young woman’s voice said. He thought she was
the one standing on his wrist. “Perhaps another day I will have time to dance with you properly.”
He started to smile—If she wants to dance, they can’t be going to kill me, at least!—then
frowned instead. He seemed to remember Aiel sometimes meant something different when they said
that.
The spears were pulled back, and hands hauled him to his feet. He shook them away and brushed
himself off as if he were standing in a common room instead of on a night-cloaked rooftop with four
Aiel. It always paid to let the other man know you had a steady nerve. The Aiel had quivers at their
waists as well as knives, and more of those short spears on their backs with cased bows, the long
spear points sticking up above their shoulders. He heard himself humming “I’m Down at the Bottom
of the Well,” and stopped it.
“What do you do here?” the man’s voice asked. With the veils, Mat was not entirely sure which
one had spoken; the voice sounded older, confident, used to command. He thought he could pick out

the woman, at least; she was the only one shorter than he, and that not by much. The others all stood a
head taller than he or more. Bloody Aiel, he thought. “We have watched you for some little time,” the
older man went on, “watched you watch the Stone. You have studied it from every side. Why?”
“I could ask the same of all of you,” another voice said. Mat was the only one who gave a start
as a man in baggy breeches stepped out of the shadows. The fellow appeared to be shoeless, for
better footing on the tiles. “I expected to find thieves, not Aiel,” the man went on, “but do not think
your numbers frighten me.” A slim staff no taller than his head made a blur and a hum as he whirled it.
“My name is Juilin Sandar, and I am a thief-catcher, and I would know why you are on the rooftops,
staring at the Stone.”
Mat shook his head. How many bloody people are on the roofs tonight? All that was needed
was for Thom to appear and play his harp, or someone to come looking for an inn. A bloody thieftaker! He wondered why the Aiel were just standing there.
“You stalk well, for a city man,” the older man’s voice said. “But why do you follow us? We
have stolen nothing. Why have you looked so often at the Stone tonight yourself?”
Even in the moonlight this Sandar’s surprise was evident. He gave a start, opened his mouth—
and closed it again as four more Aiel rose out of the dimness behind him. With a sigh, he leaned on
his slender staff. “It seems I am caught myself,” he muttered. “It seems I must answer your questions.”
He peered toward the Stone, then shook his head. “I . . . did a thing today that . . . troubles me.” He
sounded almost as though he were talking to himself, trying to puzzle it out. “Part of me says it was
right, what I did, that I must obey. Surely, it seemed right when I did it. But a small voice tells me I
. . . betrayed something. I am certain this voice is wrong, and it is very small, but it will not stop.” He
stopped then himself, shaking his head again.
One of the Aiel nodded, and spoke with the older man’s voice. “I am Rhuarc, of the Nine
Valleys sept of the Taardad Aiel, and once I was Aethan Dor, a Red Shield. Sometimes the Red
Shields do as your thief-catchers do. I say this so you will understand that I know what it is you do,
and the kind of man you must be. I mean no harm to you, Juilin Sandar of the thief-catchers, nor to the
people of your city, but you will not be suffered to raise the armcry. If you will keep silence, you will
live; if not, not.”
“You mean no harm to the city,” Sandar said slowly. “Why are you here, then?”
“The Stone.” Rhuarc’s tone made it plain that was all he meant to say.
After a moment Sandar nodded, and muttered, “I could almost wish you had the power to harm
the Stone, Rhuarc. I will hold my tongue.”
Rhuarc turned his veiled face to Mat. “And you, nameless youngling? Will you tell me now why
you watch the Stone so closely?”
“I just wanted a walk in the moonlight,” Mat said lightly. The young woman put her spearpoint to
his throat again; he tried not to swallow. Well, maybe I can tell them something of it. He must not let
them know he was shaken; if you let the other fellow know that, you lost whatever edge you might
have. Very carefully, with two fingers, he moved her steel away from him. It seemed to him that she
laughed softly. “Some friends of mine are inside the Stone,” he said, trying to sound casual.
“Prisoners. I mean to bring them out.”
“Alone, nameless one?” Rhuarc said.
“Well, there doesn’t seem to be anyone else,” Mat said dryly. “Unless you care to help? You
seem interested in the Stone yourself. If you mean to go into it, perhaps we could go together. It is a
tight roll of the dice any way you look at it, but my luck runs good.” So far, anyway. I’ve run into
black-veiled Aiel and they have not cut my throat; luck cannot get much better than that. Burn me,

it would not be bad to have a few Aiel along with me in there. “You could do worse than betting on
my luck.”
“We are not here for prisoners, gambler,” Rhuarc said.
“It is time, Rhuarc.” Mat could not tell from which of the Aiel that came, but Rhuarc nodded.
“Yes, Gaul.” He looked from Mat to Sandar and back. “Do not give the armcry.” He turned
away, and in two steps he had blended into the night.
Mat gave a start. The other Aiel were gone, too, leaving him alone with the thief-taker. Unless
they left somebody to watch us. Burn me, how could I tell if they did? “I hope you don’t mean to try
stopping me, either,” he told Sandar as he slung the bundle of fireworks on his back again and picked
up his quarterstaff. “I mean to go inside, by you or through you, one way or the other.” He went over
to the chimney to pick up the tin box; the wire handle was more than warm, now.
“These friends of yours,” Sandar said. “They are three women?”
Mat frowned at him, wishing there was enough light to show the man’s face clearly. The
fellow’s voice sounded odd. “What do you know of them?”
“I know they are inside the Stone. And I know a small gate near the river where a thief-catcher
can gain entrance with a prisoner, to take him to the cells. The cells where they must be. If you will
trust me, gambler, I can take us that far. What happens after that is up to chance. Perhaps your luck
will bring us out again alive.”
“I have always been lucky,” Mat said slowly. Do I feel lucky enough to trust him? He did not
much like the idea of pretending to be a prisoner; it seemed too easy for pretense to become reality.
But it seemed no bigger risk than trying to climb three hundred feet or more straight up in the dark.
He glanced toward the city wall, and stared. Shadows flowed along it; dim shapes trotting. Aiel,
he was sure. There must have been over a hundred. They vanished, but now he could make out
shadows moving on the cliff face that was the sheer side of the Stone of Tear. So much for going up
that way. That one fellow earlier might have made it inside without raising an alarm—Rhuarc’s
armcry—but a hundred or more Aiel would have to be like sounding bells. They might make a
diversion, though. If they caused a commotion somewhere up there, inside the Stone, then whoever
was guarding the cells might not pay as much attention to a thief-taker bringing a thief.
I might as well add a little to the confusion. I worked hard enough on it. “Very well, thieftaker. Just don’t decide I am a real prisoner at the last minute. We can start for your gate as soon as I
stir the anthill a bit.” He thought Sandar frowned, but he did not mean to tell the man more than he had
to.
Sandar followed him across the rooftops, climbing to higher levels as easily as he did. The last
roof was only a little lower than the top of the wall and ran right up to it, a matter of pulling himself
up rather than climbing.
“What are you doing?” Sandar whispered.
“Wait here for me.”
With the tin box dangling from one hand by its wire handle and his quarterstaff held horizontally
in front of him, Mat took a deep breath and started toward the Stone. He tried not to think of how far it
was to the pavement below. Light, the bloody thing is three feet wide! I could walk it with a bloody
blindfold, in my sleep! Three feet wide, in the dark, and better than fifty feet to the pavement. He tried
not to think about Sandar not being there when he came back, either. He was all but committed to this
fool notion of pretending to be a thief caught by the man, but it seemed all too probable that he would
return to the roof to find Sandar gone, maybe bringing more men to make him a prisoner in truth.
Don’t think about it. Just do the job at hand. At least I’ll finally see what it is like.

As he had suspected, there was an arrowslit in the wall of the Stone right at the end of the wall,
a deep wedge cut into the rock holding a tall, narrow opening for an archer to shoot through. If the
Stone were attacked, the soldiers inside would want some way to stop any trying to follow this path.
The slit was dark, now. There did not appear to be anyone watching. That was something he had tried
not to think about, too.
Quickly he set down the tin box at his feet, balanced his quarterstaff across the wall right against
the side of the Stone, and unslung the bundle from his back. Hurriedly he wedged it into the slit,
forcing it in as far as he could; he wanted as much of the noise to be inside as he could manage.
Pulling aside a corner of the oiled cloth cover revealed knotted fuses. After a little thinking, back in
his room, he had cut the longer fuses to match the shortest, using the pieces to help tie all the fuses
together. It seemed they should all go off at once, and a bang-and-flash like that should be enough to
pull everyone who was not completely deaf.
The lid of the tin box was hot enough that he had to blow on his fingers twice before he could
pry it off—he wished he had whatever Aludra’s trick had been, lighting that lantern so easily—to
expose the dark bit of charcoal inside, lying on a bed of sand. The wire handle came off to make
tongs, and a little blowing had the coal glowing red again. He touched the hot coal to the knotted
fuses, let tongs and coal fall over the side of the wall as the fuses hissed into flame, snatched up his
quarterstaff and darted back along the wall.
This is crazy, he thought as he ran. I don’t care how big a bang it makes. I could break my fool
neck doing thi—!
The roar behind him was louder than anything he had ever heard in his life; a monstrous fist
punched him in the back, knocking all the wind out of him even before he landed, sprawled on his
belly on the wall top, barely holding on to his staff as it swung over the edge. For a moment he lay
there, trying to make his lungs work again, trying not to think how he must have used up all his luck
this time by not falling off the wall. His ears rang like all the bells in Tar Valon.
Pushing himself up carefully, he looked back toward the Stone. A cloud of smoke hung around
the arrowslit. Behind the smoke, the shadowed shape of the arrowslit itself seemed different. Larger.
He did not understand how or why, but it did seem larger.
He only thought for a moment. At one end of the wall Sandar might be waiting, might be
intending to take him into the Stone as a pretend prisoner—or might be hurrying back with soldiers.
At the other end of the wall, there might be a way inside without any chance of Sandar betraying him.
He darted back the way he had just come, no longer worrying about the darkness or the drop to either
side.
The arrowslit was larger, most of the thinner stone at the middle simply gone, leaving a rough
hole as if someone had hammered at it with a sledge for hours. A hole just big enough for a man. How
in the Light? There was no time for wondering.
He pushed through the jagged opening, coughing at the acrid smoke, jumped to the floor inside,
and had run a dozen steps before Defenders of the Stone appeared, at least ten of them, all shouting in
confusion. Most wore only their shirts, and none had helmet or breastplate. Some carried lanterns.
Some held bared swords.
Fool! he shouted inside his head. This is why you set the bloody things off in the first place!
Light-blinded fool!
He had no time to make it back out onto the wall. Quarterstaff spinning, he threw himself at the
soldiers before they had a chance to do more than see he was there, hurled himself into them,
smashing at heads, swords, knees, whatever he could reach, knowing they were too many for him to

handle alone, knowing that his fool toss of the dice had cost Egwene and the others whatever chance
he might have had.
Suddenly Sandar was there beside him, in the light of lanterns dropped by men clawing for their
swords, his slender staff whirling even faster than Mat’s quarterstaff. Caught between two staffmen,
taken by surprise, the soldiers went down like pins in a game of bowls.
Sandar stared at the fallen men, shaking his head. “Defenders of the Stone. I have attacked
Defenders! They will have my head for—! What was it that you did, gambler? That flash of light, and
thunder, breaking stone. Did you call lightning?” His voice fell to a whisper. “Have I joined myself to
a man who can channel?”
“Fireworks,” Mat said curtly. His ears were still ringing, but he could hear more boots coming,
running boots thudding on stone. “The cells, man! Show me the way to the cells before any more get
here!”
Sandar shook himself. “This way!” He dashed down a side hall, away from the oncoming boots.
“We must hurry! They will kill us if they find us!” Somewhere above, gongs began to sound an alarm,
and more thundered echoes through the Stone.
I’m coming, Mat thought as he ran after the thief-taker. I’ll get you out or die! I promise it!
The alarm gongs sent echoes crashing through the Stone, but Rand paid no more attention to them
than he had to the roar that had come before, like muffled thunder from somewhere below. His side
ached; the old wound burned, strained almost to tearing by the climb up the side of the fortress. He
gave the pain no heed, either. A crooked smile was fixed on his face, a smile of anticipation and
dread he could not have wiped away if he had wanted to. It was close, now. What he had dreamed of.
Callandor.
I will finish it at last. One way or another, it will be done with. The dreams, finished. The
baiting, and the taunting, and the hunting. I’ll finish it all!
Laughing to himself, he hurried through the dark corridors of the Stone of Tear.
Egwene put a hand to her face, wincing. Her mouth had a bitter taste, and she was thirsty. Rand?
What? Why was I dreaming about Mat again, all mixed with Rand, and shouting that he was
coming? What?
She opened her eyes, stared at the gray stone walls, one smoky rush torch casting flickering
shadows, and screamed as she remembered it all. “No! I will not be chained again! I won’t be
collared! No!”
Nynaeve and Elayne were beside her in an instant, their bruised faces too worried and fearful
for the soothing sounds they made to be believed. But just the fact that they were there was enough to
still her screams. She was not alone. A prisoner, but not alone. And not collared.
She tried to sit up, and they helped her. They had to help her; she ached in every muscle. She
could remember every unseen blow during the frenzy that had all but driven her mad when she
realized. . . . I will not think about that. I have to think about how we are to escape. She slid
backwards until she could lean against a wall. Her pains fought with weariness; that struggle when
she had refused to give in had taken every last scrap of her strength, and the bruises seemed to sap
even more.
The cell was absolutely empty except for the three of them and the torch. The floor was bare,
and cold, and hard. The door of rough planks, splintered as if countless futile fingers had clawed at it,
was the only break in the walls. Messages had been scratched in the stone, most by unsteady hands.

The Light have mercy and let me die, one read. She blanked that out of her head.
“Are we still shielded?” she mumbled. Even talking hurt. Even as Elayne nodded, she realized
she had not had to ask. The swollen cheek on the golden-haired woman, her split lip and black eye,
were answer enough, even if her own pains had not been. If Nynaeve had been able to reach the True
Source, they surely would have been Healed.
“I have tried,” Nynaeve said despairingly. “I have tried, and tried, and tried.” She gave her
braid a sharp tug, anger seeping through despite the hopeless fear in her voice. “One of them is sitting
outside. Amico, that milk-faced chit, if they have not changed since we were thrown in here. I
suppose one is enough to maintain the shielding once it has been woven.” She barked a bitter laugh.
“For all the pains they took—and gave!—to take us, you would think we were of no importance at all.
It has been hours since they slammed that door behind us, and no one has come to ask a question, or
look, or even bring a drop of water. Perhaps they mean to leave us here until we die of thirst.”
“Bait.” Elayne’s voice quavered, though she was obviously trying to sound unafraid. And failing
miserably. “Liandrin said we are bait.”
“Bait for what?” Nynaeve asked shakily. “Bait for who? If I am bait, I’d like to shove myself
down their throats till they choke on me!”
“Rand.” Egwene stopped to swallow; even a drop of water would be welcome. “I dreamed
about Rand, and Callandor. I think he is coming here.” But why did I dream of Mat? And Perrin? It
was a wolf, but I am sure it was him. “Do not be so afraid,” she said, trying to sound confident. “We
will escape them somehow. If we could better the Seanchan, we can best Liandrin.”
Nynaeve and Elayne exchanged looks over her. Nynaeve said, “Liandrin said thirteen Myrddraal
are coming, Egwene.”
She found herself staring at that message scratched on the stone wall again: The Light have
mercy and let me die. Her hands clenched into fists. Her jaws cramped with the effort of not
screaming those words. Better to die. Better death than being turned to the Shadow, made to serve
the Dark One!
She realized that one of her hands had tightened around the pouch at her belt. She could feel the
two rings inside, the small circle of the Great Serpent and the larger, twisted stone ring.
“They did not take the ter’angreal,” she said wonderingly. She fumbled it out of her pouch. It
lay heavily on her palm, all stripes and flecks of color, a ring with only one edge.
“We were not even important enough to search,” Elayne sighed. “Egwene, are you certain Rand
is coming here? I would much rather free myself than wait for the chance of him, but if there is anyone
who can defeat Liandrin and the rest of them, it must be him. The Dragon Reborn is meant to wield
Callandor. He must be able to defeat them.”
“Not if we pull him into a cage after us,” Nynaeve muttered. “Not if they have a trap set he does
not see. Why are you staring at that ring, Egwene? Tel’aran’rhiod will not help us now. Not unless
you can dream a way out of here.”
“Perhaps I can,” she said slowly. “I could channel in Tel’aran’rhiod. Their shielding won’t stop
me reaching it. All I need do is sleep, not channel. And I am surely weary enough to sleep.”
Elayne frowned, wincing as it pulled her bruises. “I will take any chance, but how can you
channel even in a dream, cut off from the True Source? And if you can, how can it help us here?”
“I do not know, Elayne. Just because I am shielded here does not mean I am shielded in the
World of Dreams. It is at least worth a try.”
“Perhaps,” Nynaeve said worriedly. “I will take any chance, too, but you saw Liandrin and the
others the last time you used that ring. And you said they saw you, too. What if they are there again?”

“I hope they are,” Egwene said grimly. “I hope they are.”
Clutching the ter’angreal in her hand, she closed her eyes. She could feel Elayne smoothing her
hair, hear her murmuring softly. Nynaeve began to hum that wordless lullaby from her childhood; for
once, she felt no anger at it at all. The soft sounds and touches soothed her, let her surrender to her
weariness, let sleep come.
She wore blue silk this time, but she barely noticed more than that. Soft breezes caressed her
unbruised face, and sent the butterflies swirling above the wildflowers. Her thirst was gone, her
aches. She reached out to embrace saidar and was filled with the One Power. Even the triumph she
felt at succeeding was small beside the surging of the Power through her.
Reluctantly she made herself release it, closed her eyes, and filled the emptiness with a perfect
image of the Heart of the Stone. That was the one place in the Stone she could picture aside from her
cell, and how to distinguish one featureless cubicle from another? When she opened her eyes, she was
there. But she was not alone.
The form of Joiya Byir stood before Callandor, her shape so insubstantial that the surging light
of the sword shone through her. The crystal sword no longer merely glittered with refracted light. In
pulses it glowed, as if some light inside it were being uncovered, then covered and uncovered again.
The Black sister started with surprise and spun to face Egwene. “How? You are shielded! Your
Dreaming is at an end!”
Before the first words were out of the woman’s mouth, Egwene reached for saidar again, wove
the complicated flow of Spirit as she remembered it being used against her, and cut Joiya Byir off
from the Source. The Darkfriend’s eyes widened, those cruel eyes so incongruous in that beautiful,
kindly face, but Egwene was already weaving Air. The other woman’s form might seem like mist, but
the bonds held it. It seemed to Egwene that there was no effort involved in holding both flows in their
weaving. There was sweat on Joiya Byir’s forehead as she walked closer.
“You have a ter’angreal!” Fear was plain on the woman’s face, but her voice fought to hide it.
“That must be it. A ter’angreal that escaped us, and one that does not require channeling. Do you
think it will do you any good, girl? Whatever you do here, it cannot affect what happens in the real
world. Tel’aran’rhiod is a dream! When I wake, I will take your ter’angreal from you myself. Be
careful what you do, lest I have reason to be angry when I come to your cell.”
Egwene smiled at her. “Are you certain you will wake, Darkfriend? If your ter’angreal requires
channeling, why did you not wake as soon as I shielded you? Perhaps you cannot wake so long as you
are shielded here.” Her smile faded away; the effort of smiling at this woman was more than she
could bear. “A woman once showed me a scar she received in Tel’aran’rhiod, Darkfriend. What
happens here is still real when you wake.”
The sweat rolled down the Black sister’s smooth, ageless face, now. Egwene wondered if she
thought she was about to die. She almost wished she were cruel enough to do that. Most of the unseen
blows she had received had come from this woman, like a pounding of fists, for no reason more than
that she had kept trying to crawl away, no reason more than that she had refused to give up.
“A woman who can give such beatings,” she said, “should have no objections to a milder one.”
She wove another flow of Air quickly; Joiya Byir’s dark eyes bulged in disbelief as the first blow
landed across her hips. Egwene saw how to adjust the weaving so she did not have to maintain it.
“You will remember this, and feel it, when you waken. When I allow you to waken. Remember this,
too. If you ever even try to beat me again, I will return you here and leave you for the rest of your
life!” The Black sister’s eyes stared hate at her, but there was a suggestion of tears in them, too.

Egwene felt a moment of shame. Not at what she was doing to Joiya—the woman deserved
every blow, if not for her own beating, then for the deaths in the Tower—not that, not really, but
because she had spent time on her own revenge while Nynaeve and Elayne were sitting in a cell
hoping against hope that she might be able to rescue them.
She tied off and set the flows of her weavings before she knew she had done it, then paused to
study what she had done. Three separate weavings, and not only had it been no trouble to hold them
all at once, but now she had done something so they would maintain themselves. She thought she
could remember how, too. And it might be useful.
After a moment, she unraveled one of the weavings, and the Darkfriend sobbed as much from
relief as from pain. “I am not like you,” Egwene said. “This is the second time I have done something
like this, and I do not like it. I am going to have to learn to cut throats instead.” From the Black
sister’s face, she thought Egwene meant to start learning with her.
Making a disgusted sound, Egwene left her standing there, trapped and shielded, and hurried into
the forest of polished redstone columns. There had to be a way down to the cells somewhere.
The stone corridor fell silent as the final dying scream was cut off by Young Bull’s jaws closing
on the two-legs’s throat, crushing it. The blood was bitter on his tongue.
He knew this was the Stone of Tear, though he could not say how he knew. The two-legs lying
around him, one kicking his last with Hopper’s teeth buried in his throat, had smelled rank with fear
as they fought. They had smelled confused. He did not think they had known where they were—they
certainly did not belong in the wolf dream—but they had been set to keep him from that tall door
ahead, with its iron lock. To guard it, at least. They had seemed startled to see wolves. He thought
they had been startled at being there themselves.
He wiped his mouth, then stared at his hand with a momentary lack of comprehension. He was a
man again. He was Perrin. Back in his own body, in the blacksmith’s vest, with the heavy hammer at
his side.
We must hurry, Young Bull. There is something evil near.
Perrin pulled the hammer from his belt as he strode to the door. “Faile must be here.” One sharp
blow shattered the lock. He kicked open the door.
The room was empty except for a long stone block in the middle of the floor. Faile lay on that
block as if sleeping, her black hair spread out like a fan, her body so wrapped in chains that it took
him a moment to realize she was unclothed. Every chain was held to the stone by a thick bolt.
He was hardly aware of crossing the space until his hand touched her face, tracing her
cheekbone with a finger.
She opened her eyes and smiled up at him. “I kept dreaming you would come, blacksmith.”
“I will have you free in a moment, Faile.” He raised his hammer, smashed one of the bolts as if
it were wood.
“I was sure of it. Perrin.”
As his name faded from her tongue, she faded, too. With a clatter, the chains dropped to the stone
where she had been.
“No!” he cried. “I found her!”
The dream is not like the world of flesh, Young Bull. Here, the same hunt can have many
endings.
He did not turn to look at Hopper. He knew his teeth were bared in a snarl. Again he raised the
hammer, brought it down with all his strength against the chains that had held Faile. The stone block

cracked in two under his blow; the Stone itself rang like a stuck bell.
“Then I will hunt again,” he growled.
Hammer in hand, Perrin strode out of the room with Hopper beside him. The Stone was a place
of men. And men, he knew, were crueler hunters than ever wolves were.

Alarm gongs somewhere above sent sonorous clangs down the corridor, not quite drowning out
the ring of metal on metal and the shouts of fighting men rather closer. The Aiel and the Defenders,
Mat suspected. Tall, golden lamp stands, each with four golden lamps, lined the hall where Mat was,
and silk tapestries of battle scenes hung on the polished stone walls. There were even silk carpets on
the floor, dark red on dark blue, woven in the Tairen maze. For once, Mat was too busy to put a price
on anything.
This bloody fellow is good, he thought as he managed to sweep a sword thrust away from him,
but the blow he aimed at the man’s head with the other end of the staff had to turn into another block
of that darting blade. I wonder if he is one of these bloody High Lords? He almost managed a solid
blow at a knee, but his opponent sprang back, his straight blade raised on guard.
The blue-eyed man certainly wore the puffy-sleeved coat, yellow with thread-of-gold stripes,
but it was all undone, his shirt only half tucked into his breeches, and his feet bare. His shortcropped, dark hair was tousled, like that of a man roused hastily from sleep, but he did not fight like
it. Five minutes ago he had come darting out from one of the tall, carved doors that lined this hall, a
scabbardless sword in his hands, and Mat was only grateful the fellow had appeared in front of them
and not behind. He was not the first man dressed so that Mat had faced already, but he was surely the
best.
“Can you make it past me, thief-catcher?” Mat called, careful not to take his eyes off the man
waiting for him with blade poised to strike. Sandar had insisted irritably on “thief-catcher,” not
“thief-taker,” though Mat could not see any difference.
“I cannot,” Sandar called from behind him. “If you move to let me by, you will lose room to
swing that oar you call a staff, and he will spit you like a grunt.”
Like a what? “Well, think of something, Tairen. This ragamuffin is grating my nerves.”
The man in the gold-striped coat sneered. “You will be honored to die on the blade of the High
Lord Darlin, peasant, if I allow it so.” It was the first time he had deigned to speak. “Instead, I think I
will have the pair of you hung by the heels, and watch while the skin is stripped from your bodies—”
“I do not think I’d like that,” Mat said.
The High Lord’s face reddened with indignation at being interrupted, but Mat gave him no time
for any outraged comment. Quarterstaff whirling in a tight double-loop weave, so quick the staff
blurred at the ends, he leaped forward. It was all a snarling Darlin could do to keep the staff from
him. For the moment. Mat knew he could not keep this up very long, and if he was lucky then, it would
all go back to to the strike and counterstrike. If he was lucky. But he had no intention of counting on
luck this time. As soon as the High Lord had a moment to set himself in a pattern of defense, Mat
altered his attack in midwhirl. The end of the staff Darlin had been expecting at his head dipped
instead to sweep his legs out from under him. The other end did strike at his head then, as he fell, a
sharp crack that rolled his eyes back up in his head.
Panting, Mat leaned on his staff over the unconscious High Lord. Burn me, if I have to fight one
or two more like this, I’ll bloody well fall over from exhaustion! The stories do not tell you being a
hero is such hard work! Nynaeve always did find a way to make me work.
Sandar came to stand beside him, frowning down at the crumpled High Lord. “He does not look

so mighty lying there,” he said wonderingly. “He does not look so much greater than me.”
Mat gave a start and peered down the hall, where a man had just gone trotting across along a
joining corridor. Burn me, if I did not know it was crazy, I would swear that was Rand!
“Sandar, you find that—” he began, swinging his staff up onto his shoulder, and cut off when it
thudded into something.
Spinning, he found himself facing another half-dressed High Lord, this one with his sword on the
floor, his knees buckling, and both hands to his head where Mat’s staff had split his scalp. Hastily,
Mat poked him hard in the stomach with the butt of the staff to bring his hands down, then gave him
another thump on the head to put him down in a heap on top of his sword.
“Luck, Sandar,” he muttered. “You cannot beat bloody luck. Now, why don’t you find this
bloody private way the High Lords take down to the cells?” Sandar had insisted there was such a
stairway, and using it would avoid having to run through most of the Stone. Mat did not think he liked
men so eager to watch people put to the question that they wanted a quick route to the prisoners from
their apartments.
“Just be glad you were so lucky,” Sandar said unsteadily, “or this one would have killed us both
before we saw him. I know the door is here somewhere. Are you coming? Or do you mean to wait for
another High Lord to appear?”
“Lead on.” Mat stepped over the unconscious High Lord. “I am no bloody hero.”
Trotting, he followed the thief-catcher, who peered at the tall doors they passed, muttering that
he knew it was here somewhere.

CHAPTER
55
What Is Written in Prophecy

Rand entered the chamber slowly, walking among the great polished redstone columns he
remembered from his dreams. Silence filled the shadows, yet something called to him. And something
flashed ahead, a momentary light throwing back shadow, a beacon. He stepped out beneath a great
dome, and saw what he sought. Callandor, hanging hilt down in midair, waiting for no hand but that
of the Dragon Reborn. As it revolved, it broke what little light there was into splinters, and now and
then it flared as if with a light of its own. Calling him. Waiting for him.
If I am the Dragon Reborn. If I am not just some half-mad man cursed with the ability to
channel, a puppet dancing for Moiraine and the White Tower.
“Take it, Lews Therin. Take it, Kinslayer.”
He spun to face the voice. The tall man with close-cropped white hair who stepped from the
shadows among the columns was familiar to him. Rand had no idea who he was, this fellow in a red
silk coat with black stripes down its puffy sleeves and black breeches tucked into elaborately silverworked boots. He did not know the man, but he had seen him in his dreams. “You put them in a cage,”
he said. “Egwene, and Nynaeve, and Elayne. In my dreams. You kept putting them in a cage, and
hurting them.”
The man made a dismissive gesture of his hand. “They are less than nothing. Perhaps one day,
when they have been trained, but not now. I confess surprise that you cared enough to make them
useful. But you were ever a fool, ever ready to follow your heart before power. You came too soon,
Lews Therin. Now you must do what you are not yet ready for, or else die. Die, knowing you have
left these women you care for in my hands.” He seemed to be waiting for something, expectant. “I
mean to use them more, Kinslayer. They will serve me, serve my power. And that will hurt them far
more than anything they have suffered before.”
Behind Rand, Callandor flashed, throwing one pulse of warmth against his back. “Who are
you?”
“You do not remember me, do you?” The white-haired man laughed suddenly. “I do not
remember you, either, looking this way. A country lad with a flute case on his back. Did Ishamael
speak the truth? He was ever one to lie when it gained him an inch or a second. Do you remember
nothing, Lews Therin?”
“A name!” Rand demanded. “What is your name?”
“Call me Be’lal.” The Forsaken scowled when Rand did not react to the name. “Take it!” Be’lal
snapped, throwing a hand toward the sword behind Rand. “Once we rode to war side by side, and for
that I give you a chance. A bare chance, but a chance to save yourself, a chance to save those three I
mean to make my pets. Take the sword, countryman. Perhaps it will be enough to help you survive
me.”
Rand laughed. “Do you believe you can frighten me so easily, Forsaken? Ba’alzamon himself

has hunted me. Do you think I will cower now for you? Grovel before a Forsaken when I have denied
the Dark One to his face?”
“Is that what you think?” Be’lal said softly. “Truly, you know nothing.” Suddenly there was a
sword in his hands, a sword with a blade carved from black fire. “Take it! Take Callandor! Three
thousand years, while I lay imprisoned, it has waited there. For you. One of the most powerful
sa’angreal we ever made. Take it, and defend yourself, if you can!”
He moved toward Rand as if to drive him back toward Callandor, but Rand raised his own
hands—saidin filled him; sweet rushing flow of the Power; stomach-wrenching vileness of the taint
—and he held a sword wrought from red flame, a sword with a heron-mark on its fiery blade. He
stepped into the forms Lan had taught him till he flowed from one to the next as if in a dance. Parting
the Silk. Water Flows Downhill. Wind and Rain. Blade of black fire met blade of red in showers of
sparks, roars like white-hot metal shattering.
Rand came back smoothly into a guard stance, trying not to let his sudden uncertainty show. A
heron stood on the black blade, too, a bird so dark as to be nearly invisible. Once he had faced a man
with a heron-mark blade of steel, and barely survived. He knew that he himself had no real right to
the blademaster’s mark; it had been on the sword his father had given him, and when he thought of a
sword in his hands, he thought of that sword. Once he had embraced death, as the Warder had taught,
but this time, he knew, his death would be final. Be’lal was better than he with the sword. Stronger.
Faster. A true blademaster.
The Forsaken laughed, amused, swinging his blade in quick flourishes to either side of him; the
black fire roared as if swift passage through the air quickened it. “You were a greater swordsman,
once, Lews Therin,” he said mockingly. “Do you remember when we took that tame sport called
swords and learned to kill with it, as the old volumes said men once had? Do you remember even one
of those desperate battles, even one of our dire defeats? Of course not. You remember nothing, do
you? This time you have not learned enough. This time, Lews Therin, I will kill you.” Be’lal’s
mockery deepened. “Perhaps if you take Callandor, you might extend your life a little longer. A little
longer.”
He came forward slowly, almost as if to give Rand time to do just that, turn and race to
Callandor, to the Sword That Cannot Be Touched, to take it. But the doubts were still strong in Rand.
Callandor could only be touched by the Dragon Reborn. He had allowed them to proclaim him so for
a hundred reasons that seemed to leave him no choice at the time. But was he truly the Dragon
Reborn? If he raced to touch Callandor in truth, not in a dream, would his hand meet an invisible
wall while Be’lal cut him down from behind?
He met the Forsaken with the sword he knew, the blade of fire wrought with saidin. And was
driven back. The Falling Leaf met Watered Silk. The Cat Dances on the Wall met the Boar Rushes
Downhill. The River Undercuts the Bank nearly lost him his head, and he had to throw himself
inelegantly to one side with black flame brushing his hair, rolling to his feet to confront the Stone
Falls From the Mountain. Methodically, deliberately, Be’lal drove him back in a spiral that slowly
tightened on Callandor.
Shouts echoed among the columns, screams, the clash of steel, but Rand barely heard. He and
Be’lal were no longer alone in the Heart of the Stone. Men in breastplates and rimmed helmets fought
with swords against shadowy, veiled shapes that darted among the columns with short spears
stabbing. Some of the soldiers formed a rank; arrows flashing out of the dimness took them in the
throat, the face, and they died in their line. Rand hardly noticed the fighting, even when men fell dead
within paces of him. His own fight was too desperate; it took all of his concentration. Wet warmth

trickled down his side. The old wound was breaking open.
He stumbled suddenly, not seeing the dead man at his feet until he was lying on his back atop his
flute case on the stone floor.
Be’lal raised his blade of black fire, snarling. “Take it! Take Callandor and defend yourself!
Take it, or I will kill you now! If you will not take it, I will slay you!”
“No!”
Even Be’lal gave a start at the command in that woman’s voice. The Forsaken stepped back out
of the arc of Rand’s sword and turned his head to frown at Moiraine as she came striding through the
battle, her eyes fixed on him, ignoring the screaming deaths around her. “I thought you were neatly out
of the way, woman. No matter. You are only an annoyance. A stinging fly. A biteme. I will cage you
with the others, and teach you to serve the Shadow with your puny powers,” he finished with a
contemptuous laugh, and raised his free hand.
Moiraine had not stopped or slowed while he spoke. She was no more than thirty paces from
him when he moved his hand, and she raised both of hers as well.
There was an instant of surprise on the Forsaken’s face, and he had time to scream “No!” Then a
bar of white fire hotter than the sun shot from the Aes Sedai’s hands, a glaring rod that banished all
shadows. Before it, Be’lal became a shape of shimmering motes, specks dancing in the light for less
than a heartbeat, flecks consumed before his cry faded.
There was silence in the chamber as that bar of light vanished, silence except for the moans of
the wounded. The fighting had stopped dead, veiled men and men in breastplates alike standing as if
stunned.
“He was right concerning one thing,” Moiraine said, as coolly serene as if she were standing in
a meadow. “You must take Callandor. He meant to slay you for it, but it is your birthright. Better by
far that you knew more before your hand held that hilt, yet you have come to the point now, and there
is no further time for learning. Take it, Rand.”
Whips of black lightning curled around her; she screamed as they lifted her, hurled her to slide
along the floor like a sack until she came up against one of the columns.
Rand stared up at where the lightning had come from. There was a deeper shadow up there, near
the top of the columns, a blackness that made all other shadows look like noonday, and from it, two
eyes of fire stared back at him.
Slowly the shadow descended, resolving into Ba’alzamon, clothed in dead black, like a
Myrddraal’s black. Yet even that was not so dark as the shadow that clung to him. He hung in the air,
two spans above the floor, glaring at Rand with a rage as fierce as his eyes. “Twice in this life I have
offered you the chance to serve me living.” Flames leaped in his mouth as he spoke, and every word
roared like a furnace. “Twice you have refused, and wounded me. Now you will serve the Lord of the
Grave in death. Die, Lews Therin Kinslayer. Die, Rand al’Thor. It is time for you to die! I take your
soul!”
As Ba’alzamon put forth his hand, Rand pushed himself up, threw himself desperately toward
Callandor, still glittering and flashing in midair. He did not know whether he could reach it, or touch
it if he did, but he was sure it was his only chance.
Ba’alzamon’s blow struck him as he leapt, struck inside him, a ripping and crumpling, tearing
something loose, trying to pull a part of him away. Rand screamed. He felt as if he were collapsing
like an empty sack, as if he were being turned inside out. The pain in his side, the wound taken at
Falme, was almost welcome, something to hang on to, a reminder of life. His hand closed
convulsively. On Callandor’s hilt.

The One Power surged through him, a torrent greater than he could believe, fromsaidin into the
sword. The crystal blade shone brighter than even Moiraine’s fire had. It was impossible to look at,
impossible any longer to see that it was a sword, only that light blazed in his fist. He fought the flow,
wrestled with the implacable tide that threatened to carry him, all that was really him, into the sword
with it. For a heartbeat that took centuries he hung, wavering, balanced on the brink of being scoured
away like sand before a flash flood. With infinite slowness the balance firmed. It was still as though
he stood barefoot on a razor’s edge above a bottomless drop, yet something told him this was the best
that could be expected. To channel this much of the Power, he must dance on that sharpness as he had
danced the forms of the sword.
He turned to face Ba’alzamon. The tearing within him had ceased as soon as his hand touched
Callandor. Only an instant had passed, yet it seemed to have lasted forever. “You will not take my
soul,” he shouted. “This time, I mean to finish it once and for all! I mean to finish it now!”
Ba’alzamon fled, man and shadow vanishing.
For a moment Rand stared, frowning. There had been a sense of—folding—as Ba’alzamon left.
A twisting, as if Ba’alzamon had in some way bent what was. Ignoring the men staring at him,
ignoring Moiraine crumpled at the column base, Rand reached out, through Callandor, and twisted
reality to make a door to somewhere else. He did not know to where, except that it was where
Ba’alzamon had gone.
“I am the hunter now,” he said, and stepped through.
The stone shook under Egwene’s feet. The Stone shook; it rang. She caught her balance and
stopped, listening. There was no more sound, no other tremor. Whatever had happened, it was over.
She hurried on. A door of iron bars stood in her way, with a lock as big as her head. She channeled
Earth before she reached it, and when she pushed against the bars, the lock tore in half.
She walked quickly across the chamber beyond it, trying not to look at the things hanging on the
walls. Whips and iron pincers were the most innocuous. With a small shudder she pushed open a
smaller iron gate and entered a corridor lined with rough wooden doors, rush torches burning at
intervals in iron brackets; she felt almost as much relief at leaving those things behind as she did at
finding what she sought. But which cell?
The wooden doors opened easily. Some were unlocked, and the locks on the others lasted no
longer than that larger lock had earlier. But every cell was empty. Of course. No one would dream
themselves in this place. Any prisoner who managed to reach Tel’aran’rhiod would dream of a
pleasanter place.
For a moment she felt something close to despair. She had wanted to believe that finding the
right cell would make a difference. Even finding it could be impossible, though. This first corridor
stretched on and on, and others joined it.
Suddenly she saw something flicker just ahead of her. A shape even less substantial than Joiya
Byir had been. It had been a woman, though. She was sure of that. A woman seated on a bench beside
one of the cell doors. The image flickered into being again, and was gone. There was no mistaking
that slender neck and the pale, innocent-appearing face with its eyelids fluttering on the edge of sleep.
Amico Nagoyin was drifting toward sleep, dreaming of her guard duties. And apparently toying
drowsily with one of the stolen ter’angreal. Egwene could understand that; it had been a great effort
to stop using the one Verin had given her, even for a few days.
She knew it was possible to cut a woman off from the True Source even if she had already
embraced saidar, but severing a weave already established had to be much harder than damming the

flow before it began. She set the patterns of the weaving, readied them, making the threads of Spirit
much stronger, this time, thicker and heavier, a denser weave with a cutting edge like a knife.
The wavering shape of the Darkfriend appeared again, and Egwene struck out with the flows of
Air and Spirit. For an instant something seemed to resist the weaving of Spirit, and she forced it with
all of her might. It slid into place.
Amico Nagoyin screamed. It was a thin sound, barely heard, as faint as she herself was, and she
seemed almost like a shadow of what Joiya Byir had been. Yet the bonds woven of Air held her; she
did not vanish again. Terror twisted the Darkfriend’s lovely face; she seemed to be babbling, but her
shouts were whispers too soft for Egwene to understand.
Tying and setting the weaves around the Black sister, Egwene turned her attentions to the cell
door. Impatiently, she let Earth flood into the iron lock. It fell away in black dust, in a mist that
dissolved completely before it struck the floor. She swung open the door, and was not surprised to
find the cell empty except for one burning rush torch.
But Amico is bound, and the door is open.
For a moment she thought of what to do next. Then she stepped out of the dream . . .

. . . and woke to all her bruises and aches and thirst, to the wall of the cell against her back,
staring at the tightly shut cell door. Of course. What happens to living things there is real when they
wake. What I did to stone or iron or wood has no effect in the waking world.
Nynaeve and Elayne were still kneeling beside her.
“Whoever is out there,” Nynaeve said, “screamed a few moments ago, but nothing else has
happened. Did you find a way out?”
“We should be able to walk out,” Egwene said. “Help me to my feet, and I will get rid of the
lock. Amico will not trouble us. That scream was her.”
Elayne shook her head. “I have been trying to embrace saidar ever since you left. It is different,
now, but I am still cut off.”
Egwene formed the emptiness inside her, became the rosebud opening to saidar. The invisible
wall was still there. It shimmered now. There were moments when she almost thought she could feel
the True Source beginning to fill her with the Power. Almost. The shield wavered in and out of
existence too fast for her to detect. It might as well have still been solid.
She stared at the other two women. “I bound her. I shielded her. She is a living thing, not lifeless
iron. She must be shielded still.”
“Something has happened to the shield set on us,” Elayne said, “but Amico is still managing to
hold it.”
Egwene let her head sag back against the wall. “I will have to try again.”
“Are you strong enough?” Elayne grimaced. “To be blunt, you sound even weaker than you did
before. This try took something out of you, Egwene.”
“I am strong enough there.” She did feel more weary, less strong, but it was their only chance
that she could see. She said as much, and their faces said they agreed with her, however reluctantly.
“Can you go to sleep again so soon?” Nynaeve asked finally.
“Sing to me.” Egwene managed a smile. “Like when I was a little girl. Please?” Holding
Nynaeve’s hand with one of hers, the stone ring clasped in the other, she closed her eyes and tried to
find sleep in the wordless humming tune.
The wide door of iron bars stood open, and the room beyond seemed empty of life, but Mat

entered cautiously. Sandar was still out in the hall, trying to peer both ways at once, certain that a
High Lord, or maybe a hundred Defenders or so, would appear at any moment.
There were no men in the room now—and by the looks of the half-eaten meals on a long table,
they had left hurriedly; no doubt because of the fighting above—and from the looks of the things on the
walls, he was just as glad he did not have to meet any of them. Whips in different sizes and lengths,
different thicknesses, with different numbers of tails. Pincers, and tongs, and clamps, and irons.
Things that looked like metal boots, and gauntlets, and helmets, with great screws all over them as if
to tighten them down. Things he could not even begin to guess the use of. If he had met the men who
used these things, he thought he would surely have checked that they were dead before he walked
away.
“Sandar!” he hissed. “Are you going to stay out there all bloody night!” He hurried to the inner
door—barred like the outer, but smaller—without waiting for an answer, and went through.
The hall beyond was lined by rough wooden doors, and lit by the same rush torches as the room
he had just left. No more than twenty paces from him, a woman sat on a bench beside one of the
doors, leaning back against the wall in a curiously stiff fashion. She turned her head slowly toward
him at the sound of his boots grating on the stone. A pretty young woman. He wondered why she did
not move more than her head, and why even that moved as if she were half-asleep.
Was she a prisoner? Out in the hall? But nobody with a face like that could be one of the
people who uses the things on those walls. She did look almost asleep, with her eyes only partly
open. And the suffering on that lovely face surely made her one of the tortured, not a torturer.
“Stop!” Sandar shouted behind him. “She is Aes Sedai! She is one of those who took the women
you seek!”
Mat froze in the middle of a step, staring at the woman. He remembered Moiraine hurling balls
of fire. He wondered if he could deflect a ball of fire with his quarterstaff. He wondered if his luck
extended to outrunning Aes Sedai.
“Help me,” she said faintly. Her eyes still looked nearly asleep, but the pleading in her voice
was fully awake. “Help me. Please!”
Mat blinked. She still had not moved a muscle below her neck. Cautiously, he stepped closer,
waving to Sandar to stop his groaning about her being Aes Sedai. She moved her head to follow him.
No more than that.
A large iron key hung at her belt. For a moment he hesitated. Aes Sedai, Sandar said. Why
doesn’t she move? Swallowing, he eased the key free as carefully as if he were trying to take a piece
of meat from a wolf’s jaws. She rolled her eyes toward the door beside her and made a sound like a
cat that had just seen a huge dog come snarling into the room and knew there was no way out.
He did not understand it, but as long as she did not try to stop him opening that door, he did not
care why she just sat there like a stuffed scarecrow. On the other hand, he wondered if there was
something on the other side worth being afraid of. If she is one of those who took Egwene and the
others, it stands to reason she’s guarding them . Tears leaked from the woman’s eyes. Only she
looks like it’s a bloody Halfman in there . But there was only one way to find out. Propping his staff
against the wall, he turned the key in the lock and flung open the door, ready to run if need be.
Nynaeve and Elayne were kneeling on the floor with Egwene apparently asleep between them.
He gasped at the sight of Egwene’s swollen face, and changed his mind about her sleeping. The other
two women turned toward him as he opened the door—they were almost as battered as Egwene; Burn
me! Burn me!—looked at him, and gaped.
“Matrim Cauthon,” Nynaeve said, sounding shocked, “what under the Light are you doing here?”

“I came to bloody rescue you,” he said. “Burn me if I expected to be greeted as if I had come to
steal a pie. You can tell me why you look as if you’d been fighting bears later, if you want. If Egwene
cannot walk, I’ll carry her on my back. There are Aiel all over the Stone, or near enough, and either
they are killing the bloody Defenders or the bloody Defenders are killing them, but whichever way it
is, we had better get out of here while we bloody well can. If we can!”
“Mind your language,” Nynaeve told him, and Elayne gave him one of those disapproving stares
women were so good at. Neither one seemed to have her full attention in it, though. They began
shaking Egwene as if she were not covered with more bruises than he had ever seen in his life.
Egwene’s eyelids fluttered open, and she groaned. “Why did you wake me? I must understand it.
If I loose the bonds on her, she will wake and I’ll never catch her again. But if I do not, she cannot go
all the way to sleep, and—” Her eyes fell on him and widened. “Matrim Cauthon, what under the
Light are you doing here?”
“You tell her,” he told Nynaeve. “I am too busy trying to rescue you to watch my langu—” They
were all staring beyond him, glaring as if they wished they had knives in their hands.
He spun, but all he saw was Juilin Sandar, looking as if he had swallowed a rotten plum whole.
“They have cause,” he told Mat. “I. . . . I betrayed them. But I had to.”That was addressed past
Mat to the women. “The one with many honey-colored braids spoke to me, and I. . . . I had to do it.”
For a long moment the three continued to stare.
“Liandrin has vile tricks, Master Sandar,” Nynaeve said finally. “Perhaps you are not entirely to
blame. We can apportion guilt later.”
“If that is all cleared up,” Mat said, “could we go now?” It was as clear as mud to him, but he
was more interested in leaving right then.
The three women limped after him into the hall, but they stopped around the woman on the
bench. She rolled her eyes at them and whimpered. “Please. I will come back to the Light. I will
swear to obey you. With the Oath Rod in my hands I will swear. Please do not—”
Mat jumped as Nynaeve suddenly reared back and swung a fist, knocking the woman completely
off the bench. She lay there, her eyes closed all the way finally, but even lying on her side she was
still in exactly the same position she had been in on the bench.
“It is gone,” Elayne said excitedly.
Egwene bent to rummage in the unconscious woman’s pouch, transferring something Mat could
not make out to her own. “Yes. It feels wonderful. Something changed about her when you hit her,
Nynaeve. I do not know what, but I felt it.”
Elayne nodded. “I felt it, too.”
“I would like to change every last thing about her,” Nynaeve said grimly. She took Egwene’s
head in her hands; Egwene rose onto her toes, gasping. When Nynaeve took her hands away to put
them on Elayne, Egwene’s bruises were gone. Elayne’s vanished as quickly.
“Blood and bloody ashes!” Mat growled. “What do you mean hitting a woman who was just
sitting there? I don’t think she could even move!” They all three turned to look at him, and he made a
strangled sound as the air seemed to turn to thick jelly around him. He lifted into the air, until his
boots dangled a good pace above the floor. Oh, burn me, the Power! Here I was afraid that Aes
Sedai would use the bloody Power on me, and now the bloody women I’m rescuing do it! Burn me!
“You do not understand anything, Matrim Cauthon,” Egwene said in a tight voice.
“Until you do understand,” Nynaeve said in an even tighter, “I suggest you keep your opinions to
yourself.”
Elayne contented herself with a glare that made him think of his mother going out to cut a switch.

For some reason he found himself giving them the grin that had so often sent his mother after that
switch. Burn me, if they can do this, I don’t see how anybody ever locked them in that cell in the
first place! “What I understand is that I got you out of something you couldn’t get yourselves out of,
and you all have as much gratitude as a bloody Taren Ferry man with a toothache!”
“You are right,” Nynaeve said, and his boots suddenly hit the floor so hard his teeth jarred. But
he could move again. “As much as it pains me to say it, Mat, you are right.”
He was tempted to answer something sarcastic, but there was barely enough apology in her
voice as it was. “Now can we go? With the fighting going on, Sandar thinks he and I can take you out
by a small gate near the river.”
“I am not leaving just yet, Mat,” Nynaeve said. “I mean to find Liandrin and skin her,” Egwene
said, sounding almost as if she meant it literally.
“All I want to do,” Elayne said, “is pound Joiya Byir till she squeals, but I will settle for any of
them.”
“Are you all deaf?” he growled. “There is a battle going on out there! I came here to rescue you,
and I mean to rescue you.” Egwene patted his cheek as she walked by him, and so did Elayne.
Nynaeve merely sniffed. He stared after them with his mouth hanging open. “Why didn’t you say
something?” he growled at the thief-catcher.
“I saw what speaking earned you,” Sandar said simply. “I am no fool.”
“Well, I am not staying in the middle of a battle!” he shouted at the women. They were just
disappearing through the small, barred door. “I am leaving, do you hear?” They did not even look
back. Probably get themselves killed out there! Somebody will stick a sword in them while they’re
looking the other way! With a snarl, he put his quarterstaff across his shoulder and started after. “Are
you going to stand there?” he called to the thief-catcher. “I did not come this far to let them die now!”
Sandar caught up to him in the room with the whips. The three women were already gone, but
Mat had a feeling they would not be too hard to find. Just find the men bloody hanging in midair!
Bloody women! He quickened his pace to a trot.
Perrin strode down the halls of the Stone grimly, searching for some sign of Faile. He had
rescued her twice more, now, breaking her out of an iron cage once, much like the one that had held
the Aiel in Remen, and once breaking open a steel chest with a falcon worked on its side. Both times
she had melted into air after saying his name. Hopper trotted by his side, sniffing the air. As sharp as
Perrin’s nose was, the wolf’s was sharper; it had been Hopper who led them to the chest.
Perrin wondered whether he was ever going to free her in truth. There had not been any sign in a
long time, it seemed. The halls of the Stone were empty, lamps burning, tapestries and weapons
hanging on the walls, but nothing moved except himself and Hopper. Except I think that was Rand. It
had only been a glimpse, a man running as if chasing someone. It could not be him. It couldn’t, but I
think it was.
Hopper quickened his steps suddenly, heading for another set of tall doors, these clad in bronze.
Perrin tried to match the pace, stumbled, and fell to his knees, throwing out a hand to catch himself
short of dropping on his face. Weakness washed through him as if all his muscles had gone to water.
Even after the feeling receded, it took some of his strength with it. It was an effort to struggle to his
feet. Hopper had turned to look at him.
You are here too strongly, Young Bull. The flesh weakens. You do not care to hold on to it
enough. Soon flesh and dream will die together.
“Find her,” Perrin said. “That is all I ask. Find Faile.”

Yellow eyes met yellow eyes. The wolf turned and trotted to the doors. Beyond here, Young
Bull.
Perrin reached the doors and pushed. They did not budge. There seemed to be no way to open
them, no handles, nothing to grip. There was a tiny pattern worked into the metal, so fine his eyes
almost did not see it. Falcons. Thousands of tiny falcons.
She has to be here. I do not think I can last much longer. With a shout, he swung his hammer
against the bronze. It rang like a great gong. Again he struck, and the peal deepened. A third blow, and
the bronze doors shattered like glass.
Within, a hundred paces from the broken doors, a circle of light surrounded a falcon chained to a
perch. Darkness filled all the rest of that vast chamber, darkness and faint rustlings as of hundreds of
wings.
He took a step into the room, and a falcon stooped out of the murk, talons scoring his face as it
passed. He threw an arm across his eyes—talons tore at his forearm—and staggered toward the
perch. Again and again the birds came, falcons diving, striking him, tearing him, but he lumbered on
with blood pouring down his arms and shoulders, that one arm protecting the eyes he had fixed on the
falcon on the perch. He had lost the hammer; he did not know where, but he knew that if he went back
to search, he would die before he found it.
As he reached the perch, the slicing talons drove him to his knees. He peered up under his arm at
the falcon on the perch, and she stared back with dark, unblinking eyes. The chain that held her leg
was fastened to the perch with a tiny lock shaped like a hedgehog. He seized the chain with both
hands, careless of the other falcons that now became a whirlwind of cutting talons around him, and
with his last strength snapped it. Pain and the falcons brought darkness.
He opened his eyes to stinging agony, as if his face and arms and shoulders had been sliced with
a thousand knives. It did not matter. Faile was kneeling over him, those dark, tilted eyes filled with
worry, wiping his face with a cloth already soaked in his blood.
“My poor Perrin,” she said softly. “My poor blacksmith. You are hurt so badly.”
With an effort that cost more pain, he turned his head. This was the private dining room in the
Star, and near one leg of the table lay a wooden carving of a hedgehog, broken in half. “Faile,” he
whispered to her. “My falcon.”
Rand was still in the Heart of the Stone, but it was different. There were no men fighting here, no
dead men, no one at all but himself. Abruptly the sound of a great gong rang through the Stone, then
again, and the very stones beneath his feet resonated. A third time the booming came, but cut off
abruptly, as if the gong had shattered. All was still.
Where is this place? he wondered. More important, where is Ba’alzamon?
As if to answer him, a blazing shaft like the one Moiraine had made shot out of the shadows
among the columns, straight toward his chest. His wrist twisted the sword instinctively; it was instinct
as much as anything else that made him loose flows from saidin into Callandor, a flood of the Power
that made the sword blaze brighter even than that bar streaking at him. His uncertain balance between
existence and destruction wavered. Surely that torrent would consume him.
The shaft of light struck the blade of Callandor—and parted on its edge, forking to stream past
on either side. He felt his coat singe from its near passage, smelled the wool beginning to burn.
Behind him, the two prongs of frozen fire, of liquid light, struck huge redstone columns; where they
struck, stone ceased to exist, and the burning bars bored through to other columns, severing those

instantaneously as well. The Heart of the Stone rumbled as columns fell and shattered in clouds of
dust, sprays of stone fragments. What fell into the light, however, simply—was not, anymore.
A snarl of rage came from the shadows, and the blazing shaft of pure white heat vanished.
Rand swung Callandor as if he were striking at something in front of him. The white light
obscuring the blade extended, blazed ahead, and sheared through the redstone column that hid the
snarl. The polished stone sliced like silk. The severed column trembled; part of it tore loose and
dropped from the ceiling, smashing into huge, jagged chunks on the floor. As the rumbling faded, he
heard beyond it the sound of boots on stone. Running.
Callandor at the ready, Rand hurried after Ba’alzamon.
The tall archway leading out of the Heart collapsed as he reached it, the entire wall falling in
clouds of dust and rock as if to bury him, but he threw the Power at it, and all became dust floating in
the air. He ran on. He was not sure what he had done, or how, but he had no time to think on it. He ran
after Ba’alzamon’s retreating footsteps, echoing down the halls of the Stone.
Myrddraal and Trollocs leaped out of thin air, huge bestial shapes and eyeless faces distorted
with a rage to kill, in hundreds, so they jammed the hall before him and behind, scythe like swords
and blades of deadly black steel seeking his blood. Without knowing how, he turned them to vapor
that parted before him—and vanished. The air around him suddenly became choking soot, clogging
his nostrils, shutting off breath, but he made it fresh air again, a cool mist. Flames leaped from the
floor beneath his feet, spurted from the walls, the ceiling, furious jets that flashed tapestries and rugs,
tables and chests to wisps of ash, flung ornaments and lamps ahead of them as drops of molten,
burning gold; he smashed the fires flat, hardened them into a red glaze on the rock.
The stones around him faded almost to mist; the Stone faded. Reality trembled; he could feel it
unraveling, feel himself unraveling. He was being pushed out of the here, into some other place where
nothing existed at all. Callandor blazed in his hands like the sun till he thought it would melt. He
thought he himself would melt from the surge of the One Power through him, the flood that he
somehow directed into sealing up the hole that had opened around him, into holding himself on the
side of existence. The Stone became solid again.
He could not even begin to imagine what it was that he did. The One Power raged inside him till
he barely knew himself, till he barely was himself, till what was himself almost did not exist. His
precarious stability teetered. To either side lay the endless fall, obliteration by the Power that
coursed through him into the sword. Only in the dance along the razor’s sharp edge was there even an
uncertain safety. Callandor shone in his fist until it seemed he carried the sun. Dimly within him,
fluttering like a candle flame in a storm, was the surety that holding Callandor, he could do anything.
Anything.
Through endless corridors he ran, dancing along the razor, chasing the one who would slay him,
the one he must slay. There could be no other end, this time. This time one of them must die! That
Ba’alzamon knew it as well was clear. Always he fled, always staying ahead of sight so that only the
sounds of his flight drew Rand on, but even fleeing he turned this Stone of Tear that was not the Stone
of Tear against Rand, and Rand fought back with instinct and guesses and chance, fought and ran
down that knife edge in perfect balance with the Power, the tool and weapon that would consume him
utterly if he faltered.
Water filled the halls from top to bottom, thick and black as the bottom of the sea, choking off
breath. He made it air again, unknowingly, and ran on, and suddenly the air gained weight until it
seemed every inch of his skin supported a mountain, squeezing in from all directions. In the instant
before he was crushed to nothingness he chose tides out of the flood of Power raging through him—he

did not know how or which or why; it was too fast for thought or knowing—and the pressure
vanished. He pursued Ba’alzamon, and the very air was abruptly solid rock encasing him, then molten
stone, then nothing at all to fill his lungs. The ground beneath his boots pulled at him as if every pound
suddenly weighed a thousand, then all weight vanished so that a step left him spinning in midair.
Unseen maws gaped to rip his mind from his body, to tear away his soul. He sprang each trap and ran
on; what Ba’alzamon twisted to destroy him, he made right without being aware of how. Vaguely he
knew that in some way he had brought things back into natural balance, forced them into line with his
own dance down that impossibly thin divide between existence and nothingness, but that knowledge
was distant. All his awareness lay in the pursuit, the hunt, the death that must end it.
And then he was in the Heart of the Stone again, stalking through the rubbled gap that had been a
wall. Some of the columns hung like broken teeth, now. And Ba’alzamon backed away from him, eyes
burning, shadow cloaking him. Black lines like steel wires seemed to run off from Ba’alzamon into
the darkness mounding around him, vanishing into unimaginable heights and distances within that
blackness.
“I will not be undone!” Ba’alzamon cried. His mouth was fire; his shriek echoed among the
columns. “I cannot be defeated! Aid me!” Some of the darkness shrouding him drifted into his hands,
formed into a ball so black it seemed to soak up even the light of Callandor. Sudden triumph blazed
in the flames of his eyes.
“You are destroyed!” Rand shouted. Callandor spun in his hands. Its light roiled the darkness,
severed the steel-black lines around Ba’alzamon, and Ba’alzamon convulsed. As if there were two of
him he seemed to dwindle and grow larger at the same time. “You are undone!” Rand plunged the
shining blade into Ba’alzamon’s chest.
Ba’alzamon screamed, and the fires of his face flared wildly. “Fool!” he howled. “The Great
Lord of the Dark can never be defeated!”
Rand pulled Callandor’s blade free as Ba’alzamon’s body sagged and began to fall, the shadow
around him vanishing.
And suddenly Rand was in another Heart of the Stone, surrounded by columns still whole, and
fighting men screaming and dying, veiled men and men in breastplates and helmets. Moiraine still lay
crumpled at the base of a redstone column. And at Rand’s feet lay the body of a man, sprawled on its
back with a hole burned through the chest. He might have been a handsome man in his middle years,
except that where his eyes and mouth should have been were only pits from which rose tendrils of
black smoke.
I have done it, he thought. I have killed Ba’alzamon, killed Shai’tan! I have won the Last
Battle! Light, I AM the Dragon Reborn! The breaker of nations, the Breaker of the World. No! I
will END the breaking, end the killing! I will MAKE it end!
He raised Callandor above his head. Silver lightning crackled from the blade, jagged streaks
arching toward the great dome above. “Stop!” he shouted. The fighting ceased; men stared at him in
wonder, over black veils, from beneath the rims of round helmets. “I am Rand al’Thor!” he called, so
his voice rang through the chamber. “I am the Dragon Reborn!” Callandor shone in his grasp.
One by one, veiled men and helmeted, they knelt to him, crying, “The Dragon is Reborn! The
Dragon is Reborn!”

Throughout the city of Tear people woke with the dawn, speaking of the dreams they had had,
dreams of the Dragon battling Ba’alzamon in the Heart of the Stone, and when their eyes rose to the
great fortress of the Stone, they beheld a banner waving from its greatest height. Across a field of
white flowed a sinuous form like a great serpent scaled in scarlet and gold, but with a golden lion’s
mane and four legs, each tipped with five golden claws. Men came, stunned and frightened, from the
Stone to speak in hushed tones of what had happened in the night, and men and women thronged the
streets, weeping as they shouted the fulfillment of Prophecy.
“The Dragon!” they shouted. “Al’Thor! The Dragon! Al’Thor!”

Peering through an arrowslit high on the side of the Stone, Mat shook his head as he listened to
the chorus rising out of the city in waves. Well, maybe he is. He was still having a hard enough time
coming to grips with Rand really being there.
Everyone in the Stone seemed to agree with the people below, or if they did not, they were not
letting on. He had seen Rand just once since the night before, striding along a hall with Callandor in
his hand, surrounded by a dozen veiled Aiel and trailing a cloud of Tairens, a knot of Defenders of
the Stone and most of the few surviving High Lords. The High Lords, at least, seemed to think Rand
would need them to help him rule the world; the Aiel kept everyone back with sharp looks, though,
and spears if need be. They surely believed Rand was the Dragon, though they called him He Who
Comes With the Dawn. There were nearly two hundred Aiel in the Stone. They had lost a third of
their numbers in the fight, but they had killed or captured ten times as many Defenders.
As he turned from the arrowslit, his eyes brushed across Rhuarc. There was a tall stand at one
end of the room, carved and polished upright wheels of some pale, dark-striped wood with shelves
slung between them so all of the shelves would stay flat as the wheels were revolved. Each shelf held
a large book, bound in gold, covers set with sparkling gems. The Aiel had one of the books open and
was reading. Some sort of essays, Mat thought. Who would have thought an Aiel would read books?
Who’d have thought an Aiel could bloody read?
Rhuarc glanced in his direction, all cold blue eyes and level stare. Mat looked away hastily,
before the Aiel could read his thoughts on his face. At least he is not veiled, thank the Light! Burn
me, that Aviendha nearly took my head off when I asked her if she could do any dances without
spears. Bain and Chiad presented another problem. They were certainly pretty and more than
friendly, but he could not manage to talk to one without the other. The male Aiel seemed to think his
efforts to get one of them alone were funny, and for that matter, so did Bain and Chiad. Women are
odd, but Aiel women make odd seem normal!
The great table in the middle of the room, ornately carved and gilded on edges and thick legs,

had been meant for gatherings of the High Lords. Moiraine sat in one of the throne like chairs, with
the Crescent Banner of Tear worked into its towering back in gilt and polished carnelian and
pearlshell. Egwene, Nynaeve, and Elayne sat close by her.
“I still cannot believe Perrin is here in Tear,” Nynaeve was saying. “Are you sure he is all
right?”
Mat shook his head. He would have expected Perrin to have been up in the Stone last night; the
blacksmith had always been braver than anyone with good sense.
“He was well when I left him.” Moiraine’s voice was serene. “Whether he still is, I do not
know. His . . . companion is in some considerable danger, and he may have put himself into it, also.”
“His companion?” Egwene said sharply. “Wha—Who is Perrin’s companion?”
“What sort of danger?” Nynaeve demanded.
“Nothing that need concern you,” the Aes Sedai said calmly. “I will go and see to her as I may,
shortly. I have delayed only to show you this, which I found among the ter’angreal and other things of
the Power the High Lords collected over the years.” She took something from her pouch and laid it on
the table before her. It was a disc the size of a man’s hand, seemingly made of two teardrops fitted
together, one black as pitch, the other white as snow.
Mat seemed to remember seeing others like it. Ancient, like this one, but broken, where this was
whole. Three of them, he had seen; not all together, but all in pieces. But that could not be; he
remembered that they were made of cuendillar, unbreakable by any power, even the One Power.
“One of the seven seals Lews Therin Kinslayer and the Hundred Companions put on the Dark
One’s prison when they resealed it,” Elayne said, nodding as if confirming her own memory.
“More precisely,” Moiraine told her, “a focus point for one of the seals. But in essence, you are
correct. During the Breaking of the World they were scattered and hidden for safety; since the Trolloc
Wars they have been lost in truth.” She sniffed. “I begin to sound like Verin.”
Egwene shook her head. “I suppose I should have expected to find that here. Twice before Rand
faced Ba’alzamon, and both times at least one of the seals was present.”
“And this time unbroken,” Nynaeve said. “For the first time, the seal is unbroken. As if that
mattered, now.”
“You think it does not?” Moiraine’s voice was dangerous in its quiet, and the other women
frowned at her.
Mat rolled his eyes. They kept talking about unimportant things. He did not much like standing
not twenty feet from that disc now that he knew what it was, no matter the value of cuendillar, but.
. . . “Your pardon?” he said.
They all turned to stare at him as if he were interrupting something important. Burn me! Break
them out of a prison cell, save their lives half a dozen times between them before the night is done,
and they glower as hard as the bloody Aes Sedai! Well, they did not thank me then, either, did
they? You’d have thought I was sticking my nose in where it wasn’t wanted then, too, instead of
keeping some bloody Defender from putting a sword through one of them. Aloud, he said mildly,
“You do not mind if I ask a question, do you? You have all been talking this Aes Sedai . . . uh . . .
business, and no one has bothered to tell me anything.”
“Mat?” Nynaeve said warningly, tugging her braid, but Moiraine said, in a calm only just
touched with impatience, “What is it that you wish to know?”
“I want to know how all of this can be.” He meant to keep his tone soft, but despite himself he
picked up intensity as he went along. “The Stone of Tear has fallen! The Prophecies said that would
never happen till the People of the Dragon came. Does that mean we are the bloody People of the

Dragon? You, me, Lan, and a few hundred bloody Aiel?” He had seen the Warder during the night;
there had not seemed to be much edge between Lan and the Aiel as to who was the more deadly. As
Rhuarc straightened to stare at him, he hastily added, “Uh, sorry, Rhuarc. Slip of the tongue.”
“Perhaps,” Moiraine said slowly. “I came to stop Be’lal from killing Rand. I did not expect to
see the Stone of Tear fall. Perhaps we are. Prophecies are fulfilled as they are meant to be, not as we
think they should be.”
Be’lal. Mat shivered. He had heard that name last night, and he did not like it any more in
daylight. If he had known one of the Forsaken was loose—and inside the Stone—he would never
have gone near the place. He glanced at Egwene, and Nynaeve, and Elayne. Well, I’d have come in
like a bloody mouse, anyway, not thumping people left and right! Sandar had gone scurrying out of
the Stone at daybreak; to take the news to Mother Guenna, he claimed, but Mat thought it was just to
escape those stares from the three women, who looked as if they had not yet quite decided what to do
about him.
Rhuarc cleared his throat. “When a man wishes to become a clan chief, he must go to Rhuidean,
in the lands of the Jenn Aiel, the clan that is not.” He spoke slowly and frowned often at the redfringed silk carpet under his soft boots, a man trying to explain what he did not want to explain at all.
“Women who wish to become Wise Ones also make this journey, but their marking, if they are
marked, is kept secret among themselves. The men who are chosen at Rhuidean, those who survive,
return marked on the left arm. So.”
He pushed back the sleeves of his coat and shirt together to reveal his left forearm, the skin much
paler than that of his hands and face. Etched into the skin as if part of it, wrapped twice around,
marched the same gold-and-scarlet form as rippled on the banner above the Stone.
The Aiel let his sleeve fall with a sigh. “It is a name not spoken except among the clan chiefs and
the Wise Ones. We are. . . .” He cleared his throat again, unable to say it here.
“The Aiel are the People of the Dragon.” Moiraine spoke quietly, but she sounded as close to
startlement as Mat could remember ever hearing her. “That I did not know.”
“Then it really is all done,” Mat said, “just as the Prophecies said. We can all go on our way
with no more worries.” The Amyrlin won’t need me to blow that bloody Horn now!
“How can you say that?” Egwene demanded. “Don’t you understand the Forsaken are loose?”
“Not to mention the Black Ajah,” Nynaeve added grimly. “We took only Amico and Joiya here.
Eleven escaped—and I would like to know how!—and the Light alone knows how many others there
are we do not know.”
“Yes,” Elayne said in a tone just as hard. “I may not be up to facing one of the Forsaken, but I
mean to take pieces out of Liandrin’s hide!”
“Of course,” Mat said smoothly. “Of course.” Are they crazy? They want to chase after the
Black Ajah and the Forsaken? “I only meant the hardest part is done. The Stone has fallen to the
People of the Dragon, Rand has Callandor, and Shai’tan is dead.” Moiraine’s stare was so hard that
he thought the Stone shook for a moment.
“Be quiet, you fool!” the Aes Sedai said in a voice like a knife. “Do you want to call his
attention to you, naming the Dark One?”
“But he’s dead!” Mat protested. “Rand killed him. I saw the body!” And a fine stink that was,
too. I never thought anything could rot that fast.
“You saw ‘the body,’ ” Moiraine said with a twist to her mouth. “A man’s body. Not the Dark
One, Mat.”
He looked at Egwene and the other two women; they appeared as confused as he. Rhuarc looked

to be thinking of a battle he had thought was won and now learned had not even been fought. “Then
who was it?” Mat demanded. “Moiraine, my memory has holes big enough for a wagon and team, but
I remember Ba’alzamon being in my dreams. I remember! Burn me, I do not see how I can ever
forget! And I recognized what was left of that face.”
“You recognized Ba’alzamon,” Moiraine said. “Or rather, the man who called himself
Ba’alzamon. The Dark One yet lives, imprisoned at Shayol Ghul, and the Shadow yet lies across the
Pattern.”
“The Light illumine and protect us,” Elayne murmured in a faint voice. “I thought. . . . I thought
the Forsaken were the worst we had to worry about, now.”
“Are you sure, Moiraine?” Nynaeve said. “Rand was certain—is certain—that he killed the
Dark One. You seem to be saying Ba’alzamon was not the Dark One at all. I don’t understand! How
can you be so sure? And if he was not the Dark One, who was he?”
“I can be sure for the simplest of reasons, Nynaeve. However fast decay took it, that was a
man’s body. Can you believe that if the Dark One were killed he would leave a human body? The
man Rand killed was a man. Perhaps he was the first of the Forsaken freed, or perhaps he was never
entirely bound. We may never know which.”
“I . . . may know who he was.” Egwene paused with an uncertain frown. “At least, I may have a
clue. Verin showed me a page from an old book that mentioned Ba’alzamon and Ishamael together. It
was almost High Chant and very nearly incomprehensible, but I remember something about ‘a name
hidden behind a name.’ Maybe Ba’alzamon was Ishamael.”
“Perhaps,” Moiraine said. “Perhaps it was Ishamael. But if it was, at least nine of the thirteen
still live. Lanfear, and Sammael, and Ravhin, and. . . . Paah! Even knowing that some of those nine at
least are free is not the most important thing.” She laid a hand atop the black-and-white disc on the
table. “Three of the seals are broken. Only four still hold. Only those four seals stand between the
Dark One and the world, and it may be that even with those whole he can touch the world after a
fashion. Whatever battle we won here—battle or skirmish—it is far from the last.”
Mat watched their faces firm—Egwene’s and Nynaeve’s and Elayne’s; slowly, reluctantly, but
determinedly, too—and shook his head. Bloody women! They’re all ready to go on with this, go on
chasing the Black Ajah, trying to fight the Forsaken and the bloody Dark One. Well, they needn’t
think I am going to come pull them out of the soup pot again. They just needn’t think it, that’s all!
One of the tall, paired doors pushed open while he was trying to think of something to say, and a
tall young woman of regal bearing entered the room, wearing a coronet with a golden hawk in flight
above her brows. Her black hair swept to pale shoulders, and her dress of the finest red silk left those
shoulders bare, along with a considerable expanse of what Mat noted as an admirable bosom. For a
moment she studied Rhuarc interestedly with large, dark eyes; then she turned them on the women at
the table, coolly imperious. Mat she appeared to ignore completely.
“I am not used to being given messages to carry,” she announced, flourishing a folded parchment
in one slim hand.
“And who are you, child?” Moiraine asked.
The young woman drew herself up even more, which Mat would have thought was impossible.
“I am Berelain, First of Mayene.” She tossed the parchment down on the table in front of Moiraine
with a haughty gesture and turned back to the door.
“A moment, child,” Moiraine said, unfolding the parchment. “Who gave this to you? And why
did you bring it, if you are so unused to carrying messages?”
“I . . . do not know.” Berelain stood facing the door; she sounded puzzled. “She was . . .

impressive.” She gave herself a shake and seemed to recover her opinion of herself. For a moment
she studied Rhuarc with a small smile. “You are the leader of these Aielmen? Your fighting disturbed
my sleep. Perhaps I will ask you to dine with me. One day quite soon.” She looked over her shoulder
at Moiraine. “I am told the Dragon Reborn has taken the Stone. Inform the Lord Dragon that the First
of Mayene will dine with him tonight.” And she marched out of the room; Mat could think of no other
way to describe that stately, one-woman procession.
“I would like to have her in the Tower as novice.” Egwene and Elayne said it almost like
echoes, then shared a tight smile.
“Listen to this,” Moiraine said. “ ‘Lews Therin was mine, he is mine, and he will be mine,
forever. I give him into your charge, to keep for me until I come.’ It is signed ‘Lanfear.’ ” The Aes
Sedai turned that cool gaze on Mat. “And you thought it was done? You are ta’veren, Mat, a thread
more crucial to the Pattern than most, and the sounder of the Horn of Valere. Nothing is done for you,
yet.”
They were all looking at him. Nynaeve sadly, Egwene as though she had never seen him before,
Elayne as if she expected him to change into someone else. Rhuarc had a certain respect in his eyes,
though Mat would just as soon have done without it, all things considered.
“Well, of course,” he told them. Burn me! “I understand.” I wonder how soon Thom will be fit
to travel? Time to run. Maybe Perrin will come with us. “You can count on me.”
From outside, the cries still rose, unceasing. “The Dragon! Al’Thor! The Dragon! Al’Thor! The
Dragon! Al’Thor! The Dragon!”
And it was written that no hand but his should wield the Sword held in the Stone, but he did
draw it out, like fire in his hand, and his glory did burn the world. Thus did it begin. Thus do we sing
his Rebirth. Thus do we sing the beginning.
