PROLOGUE

Deceptive Appearances

E thenielle had seen mountains lower than these misnamed Black Hills, great lopsided heaps
of half-buried boulders, webbed with steep twisting passes. A number of those passes would
have given a goat pause. You could travel three days through drought-withered forests and
brown-grassed meadows without seeing a single sign of human habitation, then suddenly find
yourself within half a day of seven or eight tiny villages, all ignorant of the world. The Black
Hills were a rugged place for farmers, away from the trade routes, and harsher now than usual.
A gaunt leopard that should have vanished at the sight of men watched from a steep slope, not
forty paces away, as she rode past with her armored escort. Westward, vultures wheeled patient
circles like an omen. Not a cloud marred the blood-red sun, yet there were clouds of a sort.
When the warm wind blew, it raised walls of dust.
With fifty of her best men at her heels, Ethenielle rode unconcernedly, and unhurriedly. Unlike
her near-legendary ancestor Surasa, she had no illusion that the weather would heed her wishes just
because she held the Throne of the Clouds, while as for haste. . . . Their carefully coded, closely
guarded letters had agreed on the order of march, and that had been determined by each person’s need
to travel without attracting notice. Not an easy task. Some had thought it impossible.
Frowning, she considered the luck that had let her come this far without having to kill anyone,
avoiding those flyspeck villages even when it meant days added to the journey. The few Ogier
stedding presented no problem—Ogier paid little heed to what happened among humans, most times,
and less than usual of late, it seemed—but the villages. . . . They were too small to hold eyes-andears for the White Tower, or for this fellow who claimed to be the Dragon Reborn—perhaps he was;
she could not decide which way would be worse—too small, yet peddlers did pass through,
eventually. Peddlers carried as much gossip as trade goods, and they spoke to people who spoke to
other people, rumor flowing like an ever-branching river, through the Black Hills and into the world
outside. With a few words, a single shepherd who had escaped notice could light a signal fire seen
five hundred leagues off. The sort of signal fire that set woods and grasslands aflame. And cities,
maybe. Nations.
“Did I make the right choice, Serailla?” Vexed at herself, Ethenielle grimaced. She might not be
a girl any longer, but her few gray hairs hardly counted her old enough to let her mindless tongue flap
in the breeze. The decision was made. It had been on her mind, though. Light’s truth, she was not so
unconcerned as she wanted to be.

Ethenielle’s First Councilor heeled her dun mare closer to the Queen’s sleek black gelding.
Round face placid, dark eyes considering, Lady Serailla could have been a farmwife suddenly stuck
into a noblewoman’s riding dress, but the mind behind those plain, sweaty features was as sharp as
any Aes Sedai’s. “The other choices only carried different risks, not lesser,” she said smoothly. Stout
yet as graceful in her saddle as she was at dancing, Serailla was always smooth. Not oily, or false;
just completely unflappable. “Whatever the truth, Majesty, the White Tower appears to be paralyzed
as well as shattered. You could have sat watching the Blight while the world crumbled behind you.
You could have if you were someone else.”
The simple need to act. Was that what had brought her here? Well, if the White Tower would not
or could not do what had to be done, then someone must. What good to guard the Blight if the world
did crumble behind her?
Ethenielle looked to the slender man riding at her other side, white streaks at his temples giving
him a supercilious air, the ornately sheathed Sword of Kirukan resting in the crook of one arm. It was
called the Sword of Kirukan, at any rate, and the fabled warrior Queen of Aramaelle might have
carried it. The blade was ancient, some said Power-wrought. The two-handed hilt lay toward her as
tradition demanded, though she herself was not about to try using a sword like some fire-brained
Saldaean. A queen was supposed to think, lead, and command, which no one could manage while
trying to do what any soldier in her army could do better. “And you, Swordbearer?” she said. “Do
you have any qualms at this late hour?”
Lord Baldhere twisted in his gold-worked saddle to glance back at the banners carried by
horsemen behind them, cased in tooled leather and embroidered velvet. “I don’t like hiding who I am,
Majesty,” he said fussily, straightening around. “The world will know us soon enough, and what
we’ve done. Or tried to do. We’ll end dead or in the histories or both, so they might as well know
what names to write.” Baldhere had a biting tongue, and he affected to care more for music and his
clothes than anything else—that well-cut blue coat was the third he had worn already today—but as
with Serailla, appearances deceived. The Swordbearer to the Throne of the Clouds bore
responsibilities much heavier than that sword in its jeweled scabbard. Since the death of her husband
some twenty years ago, Baldhere had commanded the armies of Kandor for her in the field, and most
of her soldiers would have followed him to Shayol Ghul itself. He was not counted among the great
captains, but he knew when to fight and when not, as well as how to win.
“The meeting place must be just ahead,” Serailla said suddenly, just as Ethenielle saw the scout
Baldhere had sent forward, a sly fellow named Lomas who wore a foxhead crest on his helmet, rein
in atop the peak of the pass ahead. With his lance slanted, he made the arm gesture for “assembly
point in sight.”
Baldhere swung his heavy-shouldered gelding and bellowed a command for the escort to halt—
he could bellow, when he had a mind to—then spurred the bay to catch up to her and Serailla. It was
to be a meeting between long-standing allies, but as they rode past Lomas, Baldhere gave the leanfaced man a curt order to “Watch and relay”; should anything go wrong, Lomas would signal the
escort forward to bring their queen out.
Ethenielle sighed faintly when Serailla nodded approval at the command. Allies of long
standing, yet the times bred suspicion like flies on a midden. What they were about stirred the heap
and set the flies swirling. Too many rulers to the south had died or vanished in the last year for her to
feel any comfort in wearing a crown. Too many lands had been smashed as thoroughly as an army of
Trollocs could have achieved. Whoever he was, this al’Thor fellow had much to answer for. Much.
Beyond Lomas the pass opened into a shallow bowl almost too small to be named a valley, with

trees too widely spaced to be called a thicket. Leatherleaf and blue fir and three-needle pine held to
some green along with a few oaks, but the rest were sheathed in brown if not bare-branched. To the
south, however, lay what had made this spot a good choice for meeting. A slender spire like a column
of gleaming golden lace lay slanting and partly buried in the bare hillside, a good seventy paces of it
showing above the treetops. Every child in the Black Hills old enough to run off leading strings knew
of it, but there was not a village inside four days’ travel, nor would anyone come within ten miles
willingly. The stories of this place spoke of mad visions, of the dead walking, and death at touching
the spire.
Ethenielle did not consider herself fanciful, yet she shivered slightly. Nianh said the spire was a
fragment from the Age of Legends, and harmless. With luck, the Aes Sedai had no reason to recall that
conversation of years ago. A pity the dead could not be made to walk, here. Legend said Kirukan had
beheaded a false Dragon with her own hands, and borne two sons by another man who could channel.
Or maybe the same one. She might have known how to go about their purpose and survive.
As expected, the first pair of those Ethenielle had come to meet was waiting, each with two
attendants. Paitar Nachiman had many more creases in his long face than the stunningly handsome
older man she had admired as a girl, not to mention too little hair and most of that gray. Fortunately he
had relinquished the Arafellin fashion for braids and wore his hair cut short. But he sat his saddle
straight-backed, his shoulders needed no padding in that embroidered green silk coat, and she knew
he still could wield the sword at his hip with vigor and skill. Easar Togita, square-faced and his
scalp shaved except for a white topknot, his plain coat the color of old bronze, was a head shorter
than the King of Arafel, and slighter, yet he made Paitar look almost soft. Easar of Shienar did not
scowl—if anything, a touch of sadness seemed permanent in his eyes—but he might have been made
from the same metal as the long sword on his back. She trusted both men—and hoped their familial
connections helped secure that trust. Alliances by marriage had always bound the Borderlands
together as much as their war against the Blight did, and she had a daughter wed to Easar’s third son
and a son to Paitar’s favorite granddaughter, as well as a brother and two sisters married into their
Houses.
Their companions appeared as different as their kings. As always, Ishigari Terasian looked just
risen from a stupor after a drunken feast, as fat a man as she had ever seen in a saddle; his fine red
coat was rumpled, his eyes bleary, his cheeks unshaven. By contrast, Kyril Shianri, tall and lean, and
nearly as elegant as Baldhere despite the dust and sweat on his face, with silver bells on his boot tops
and gloves as well as fastened to his braids; he wore his usual expression of dissatisfaction and had a
way of always peering coolly down his prominent nose at anyone but Paitar. Shianri really was a fool
in many ways—Arafellin kings rarely made much pretense of listening to councilors, relying instead
on their queens—but he was more than he appeared at a glance. Agelmar Jagad could have been a
larger version of Easar, a simple, plainly garbed man of steel and stone with more weapons hung
about him than Baldhere carried, sudden death waiting to be unleashed, while Alesune Chulin was as
slim as Serailla was stout, as pretty as Serailla was plain, and as fiery as Serailla was calm. Alesune
seemed born to her fine, blue silks. It was well to remember that judging Serailla by her surface was
a mistake, too.
“Peace and the Light favor you, Ethenielle of Kandor,” Easar said gruffly as Ethenielle reined in
before them, and at the same time Paitar intoned, “The Light embrace you, Ethenielle of Kandor.”
Paitar still had a voice to make women’s hearts beat faster. And a wife who knew he was hers to his
bootsoles; Ethenielle doubted that Menuki had ever had a jealous moment in her life, or cause for one.
She made her own greetings just as short, ending with a direct “I hope you’ve come this far

without detection.”
Easar snorted and leaned on his cantle, eyeing her grimly. A hard man, but eleven years
widowed and still mourning. He had written poetry for his wife. There was always more than the
surface. “If we’ve been seen, Ethenielle,” he grumbled, “then we might as well turn back now.”
“You speak of turning back already?” Between his tone and a flip of his tasseled reins, Shianri
managed to combine disdain with barely enough civility to forestall a challenge. Even so, Agelmar
studied him coldly, shifting in his saddle slightly, a man recalling where each of his weapons was
placed. Old allies in many battles along the Blight, but those new suspicions swirled.
Alesune made her mount dance, a gray mare as tall as a warhorse. The thin white streaks in her
long black hair suddenly seemed crests on a helmet, and her eyes made it easy to forget that Shienaran
women neither trained with weapons nor fought duels. Her title was simply shatayan of the royal
household, yet whoever believed any shatayan’s influence stopped at ordering the cooks and maids
and victualers made a grave error. “Foolhardiness is not courage, Lord Shianri. We leave the Blight
all but unguarded, and if we fail, maybe even if we succeed, some of us could find our heads on
spikes. Perhaps all of us will. The White Tower may well see to it if this al’Thor does not.”
“The Blight seems almost asleep,” Terasian muttered, whiskers rasping as he rubbed his fleshy
chin. “I’ve never seen it so quiet.”
“The Shadow never sleeps,” Jagad put in quietly, and Terasian nodded as if that, too, was
something to consider. Agelmar was the best general of them all, one of the best to be found
anywhere, but Terasian’s place at Paitar’s right hand had not come because he was a good drinking
companion.
“What I’ve left behind can guard the Blight short of the Trolloc Wars coming again,” Ethenielle
said in a firm voice. “I trust you’ve all done as well. It hardly matters, though. Does anyone believe
we truly can turn back now?” She made that last question dry, expecting no answer, but she received
one.
“Turn back?” a young woman’s high voice demanded behind her. Tenobia of Saldaea galloped
into the gathering, drawing her white gelding up so that he reared flamboyantly. Thick lines of pearls
marched down the dark gray sleeves of her narrow-skirted riding habit, while red-and-gold
embroidery swirled thickly to emphasize the narrowness of her waist and the roundness of her bosom.
Tall for a woman, she managed to be pretty if not beautiful despite a nose that was overbold at best.
Large tilted eyes of a dark deep blue certainly helped, but so did a confidence in herself so strong that
she seemed to glow with it. As expected, the Queen of Saldaea was accompanied only by Kalyan
Ramsin, one of her numerous uncles, a scarred and grizzled man with the face of an eagle and thick
mustaches that curved down around his mouth. Tenobia Kazadi tolerated the counsel of soldiers, but
no one else. “I will not turn back,” she went on fiercely, “whatever the rest of you do. I sent my dear
Uncle Davram to bring me the head of the false Dragon Mazrim Taim, and now he and Taim both
follow this al’Thor, if I can believe half what I hear. I have close to fifty thousand men behind me,
and whatever you decide, I will not turn back until my uncle and al’Thor learn exactly who rules
Saldaea.”
Ethenielle exchanged glances with Serailla and Baldhere while Paitar and Easar began telling
Tenobia that they also meant to keep on. Serailla gave her head the smallest shake, made the slightest
shrug. Baldhere rolled his eyes openly. Ethenielle had not exactly hoped Tenobia might decide at the
last to stay away, but the girl would surely make difficulties.
Saldaeans were a strange lot—Ethenielle had often wondered how her sister Einone managed so
well married to yet another of Tenobia’s uncles—yet Tenobia carried that strangeness to extremes.

You expected showiness from any Saldaean, but Tenobia took delight in shocking Domani and making
Altarans seem drab. Saldaean tempers were legendary; hers was wildfire in a high wind, and you
could never tell what would provide the spark. Ethenielle did not even want to think of the difficulty
in getting the woman to listen to reason when she did not want to; only Davram Bashere had ever
been able to do that. And then there was the question of marriage.
Tenobia was still young, though years past the age she should have wed—marriage was a duty
for any member of a ruling House, the more so for a ruler; alliances had to be made, an heir provided
—yet Ethenielle had never considered the girl for any of her own sons. Tenobia’s requirements for a
husband were on a level with everything else about her. He must be able to face and slay a dozen
Myrddraal at once. While playing the harp and composing poetry. He must be able to confound
scholars while riding a horse down a sheer cliff. Or perhaps up it. Of course he would have to defer
to her—she was a queen, after all—except that sometimes Tenobia would expect him to ignore
whatever she said and toss her over his shoulder. The girl wanted exactly that! And the Light help
him if he chose to toss when she wanted deference, or to defer when she wanted the other. She never
said any of this right out, but any woman with wits who had heard her talk about men could piece it
together in short order. Tenobia would die a maiden. Which meant her uncle Davram would succeed,
if she left him alive after this, or else Davram’s heir.
A word caught Ethenielle’s ear and jerked her upright in her saddle. She should have been
paying attention; too much was at stake. “Aes Sedai?” she said sharply. “What about Aes Sedai?”
Save for Paitar’s, their White Tower advisors had all left at news of the troubles in the Tower, her
own Nianh and Easar’s Aisling vanishing without a trace. If Aes Sedai had gained a hint of their
plans. . . . Well, Aes Sedai always had plans of their own. Always. She would dislike discovering
that she was putting her hands into two hornet’s nests, not just one.
Paitar shrugged, looking a trifle embarrassed. That was no small trick for him; he, like Serailla,
let nothing upset him. “You hardly expected me to leave Coladara behind, Ethenielle,” he said in
soothing tones, “even if I could have kept the preparations from her.” She had not; his favorite sister
was Aes Sedai, and Kiruna had given him a deep fondness for the Tower. Ethenielle had not expected
it, but she had hoped. “Coladara had visitors,” he continued. “Seven of them. Bringing them along
seemed prudent, under the circumstances. Fortunately, they require little convincing. None, in truth.”
“The Light illumine and preserve our souls,” Ethenielle breathed, and heard near echos from
Serailla and Baldhere. “Eight sisters, Paitar? Eight?” The White Tower surely knew every move they
intended, now.
“And I have five more,” Tenobia put in as if announcing she had a new pair of slippers. “They
found me just before I left Saldaea. By chance, I’m sure; they appeared as surprised as I was. Once
they learned what I was doing—I still don’t know how they did, but they did—once they learned, I
was sure they’d go scurrying to find Memara.” Her brows furrowed in a momentary glare. Elaida had
miscalculated badly in sending a sister to try bullying Tenobia. “Instead,” she finished, “Illeisien and
the rest were more intent on secrecy than I.”
“Even so,” Ethenielle insisted. “Thirteen sisters. All that is needed is for one of them to find
some way to send a message. A few lines. A soldier or a maid intimidated. Does any of you think you
can stop them?”
“The dice are out of the cup,” Paitar said simply. What was done, was done. Arafellin were
almost as odd as Saldaeans, in Ethenielle’s book.
“Farther south,” Easar added, “it may be well to have thirteen Aes Sedai with us.” That brought
a silence while the implications hung in the air. No one wanted to voice them. This was far different

from facing the Blight.
Tenobia gave a sudden, shocking laugh. Her gelding tried to dance, but she settled him. “I mean
to press south as fast as I can, but I invite you all to dine with me in my camp tonight. You can speak
with Illeisien and her friends, and see whether your judgment matches mine. Perhaps tomorrow night
we can all gather in Paitar’s camp and question his Coladara’s friends.” The suggestion was so
sensible, so obviously necessary, that it brought instant agreement. And then Tenobia added, as if an
afterthought, “My uncle Kalyan would be honored if you allowed him to sit beside you tonight,
Ethenielle. He admires you greatly.”
Ethenielle glanced toward Kalyan Ramsin—the fellow had sat his horse silently behind
Tenobia, never speaking, hardly seeming to breathe—she merely glanced at him, and for an instant
that grizzled eagle unhooded his eyes. For an instant, she saw something she had not seen since her
Brys died, a man looking not at a queen, but at a woman. The shock of it was a blow taking her
breath. Tenobia’s eyes darted from her uncle to Ethenielle, her tiny smile quite satisfied.
Outrage flared in Ethenielle. That smile made it all clear as spring water, if Kalyan’s eyes had
not. This chit of a girl thought to marry off this fellow to her? This child presumed to . . . ? Suddenly,
ruefulness replaced fury. She herself had been younger when she arranged her widowed sister
Nazelle’s wedding. A matter of state, yet Nazelle had come to love Lord Ismic despite all her
protests in the beginning. Ethenielle had been arranging others’ marriages for so long that she had
never considered that her own would make a very strong tie. She looked at Kalyan again, a longer
look. His leathery face was all proper respect once more, yet she saw his eyes as they had been. Any
consort she chose would have to be a hard man, but she had always demanded a chance of love for
her children’s marriages, if not her siblings’, and she would do no less for herself.
“Instead of wasting daylight on chatter,” she said, more breathless than she could have wished,
“let us do what we came for.” The Light sear her soul, she was a woman grown, not a girl meeting a
prospective suitor for the first time. “Well?” she demanded. This time, her tone was suitably firm.
All of their agreements had been made in those careful letters, and all of their plans would have
to be modified as they moved south and circumstances changed. This meeting had only one real
purpose, a simple and ancient ceremony of the Borderlands that had been recorded only seven times
in all the years since the Breaking. A simple ceremony that would commit them beyond anything
words could do, however strong. The rulers moved their horses closer while the others drew back.
Ethenielle hissed as her belt knife slashed across her left palm. Tenobia laughed at cutting hers.
Paitar and Easar might as well have been plucking splinters. Four hands reached out and met,
gripped, heart’s blood mingling, dripping to the ground, soaking into the stony dirt. “We are one, to
the death,” Easar said, and they all spoke with him. “We are one, to the death.” By blood and soil,
they were committed. Now they had to find Rand al’Thor. And do what needed to be done. Whatever
the price.
Once she was sure that Turanna could sit up on the cushion unaided, Verin rose and left the
slumped White sister sipping water. Trying to sip, anyway. Turanna’s teeth chattered on the silver
cup, which was no surprise. The tent’s entryway stood low enough that Verin had to duck in order to
put her head out. Weariness augered into her back when she bent. She had no fear of the woman
shivering behind her in a coarse black woolen robe. Verin held the shield on her tight, and she
doubted Turanna possessed enough strength in her legs at the moment to contemplate leaping on her
from behind, even if such an incredible thought occurred to her. Whites just did not think that way.
For that matter, in Turanna’s condition, it was doubtful she would be able to channel a hair for
several hours yet, even if she were not shielded.

The Aiel camp covered the hills that hid Cairhien, low earth-colored tents filling the space
between the few trees left standing this close to the city. Faint clouds of dust hung in the air, but
neither dust nor heat nor the glare of an angry sun bothered the Aiel at all. Bustle and purpose filled
the camp to equal any city. Within her sight were men butchering game and patching tents, sharpening
knives and making the soft boots they all wore, women cooking over open fires, baking, working
small looms, looking after some of the few children in the camp. Everywhere white-robed gai’shain
darted about carrying burdens, or stood beating rugs, or tended packhorses and mules. No hawkers or
shopkeepers. Or carts and carriages, of course. A city? It was more like a thousand villages gathered
in one spot, though men greatly outnumbered women and, except for the blacksmiths making their
anvils ring, nearly every man not in white carried weapons. Most of the women did, as well.
The numbers certainly equaled one of the great cities’, more than enough to envelope a few Aes
Sedai prisoners completely, yet Verin saw a black-robed woman plodding away not fifty paces off,
struggling to pull a waist-high pile of rocks behind her on a cowhide. The deep cowl hid her face, but
no one in the camp except the captive sisters wore those black robes. A Wise One strolled along
close to the hide, glowing with the Power as she shielded the prisoner, while a pair of Maidens
flanked the sister, using switches to urge her on whenever she faltered. Verin wondered whether she
had been meant to see. That very morning she had passed a wild-eyed Coiren Saeldain, sweat
streaming down her face, with a Wise One and two tall Aielmen for escort and a large basket heaped
with sand bending her back as she staggered up a slope. Yesterday it had been Sarene Nemdahl. They
had set her moving handfuls of water from one hide bucket to another beside it, switched her to move
faster, then switched her for every drop spilled when the water spilled because they were switching
her to move faster. Sarene had stolen a moment to ask Verin why, though not as if she expected any
answer. Verin certainly had not been able to supply one before the Maidens drove Sarene back to her
useless labor.
She suppressed a sigh. For one thing, she could not truly like seeing sisters treated so, whatever
the reasons or need, and for another, it was obvious that a fair number of the Wise Ones wanted. . . .
What? For her to know that being Aes Sedai counted for nothing here? Ridiculous. That had been
made abundantly clear days ago. Perhaps that she could be put into a black robe, too? For the time she
thought she was safe from that, at least, but the Wise Ones hid a number of secrets she had yet to
puzzle out, the smallest of them how their hierarchy worked. Very much the smallest, yet life and a
whole skin lay wrapped inside that one. Women who gave commands sometimes took them from the
very women they had been commanding earlier, and then later it was turned about again, all without
rhyme or reason that she could see. No one ever ordered Sorilea, though, and in that might lie safety.
Of a sort.
She could not help a surge of satisfaction. Early this morning in the Sun Palace, Sorilea had
demanded to know what shamed wetlanders most. Kiruna and the other sisters did not understand;
they made no real efforts to see what was happening out here, perhaps fearing what they might learn,
fearing the strains knowledge might put on their oaths. They still struggled to justify taking the path
fate had pushed them down, but Verin already had reasons for the path she followed, and purpose.
She also had a list in her pouch, ready to hand to Sorilea when they were alone. No need to let the
others know. Some of the captives she had never met, but she thought that for most women, that list
summed up the weaknesses Sorilea was seeking. Life was going to grow much more difficult for the
women in black. And her own efforts would be aided no end, with luck.
Two great hulking Aielmen, each an axe handle wide across the shoulders, sat right outside the
tent, seemingly absorbed in a game of cat’s cradle, but they had looked around immediately when her

head appeared through the tentflaps. Coram had risen like a serpent uncoiling for all of his size, and
Mendan waited only to tuck the string away. Had she been standing straight, her head barely would
have reached the chest of either. She could have turned them both upside down and paddled them, of
course. Had she dared. She had been tempted from time to time. They were her assigned guides, her
protection against misunderstandings in the camp. And doubtless they reported everything she said or
did. In some ways she would have preferred to have Tomas with her, but only some. Keeping secrets
from your Warder was far more difficult than keeping them from strangers.
“Please tell Colinda that I’m done with Turanna Norill,” she told Coram, “and ask her to send
Katerine Alruddin to me.” She wanted to deal first with the sisters who had no Warders. He nodded
once before trotting off without speaking. These Aielmen were not much for civility.
Mendan settled into a crouch, watching her with startlingly blue eyes. One of them stayed with
her no matter what she said. A strip of red cloth was tied around Mendan’s temples and marked with
the ancient symbol of Aes Sedai. Like the other men who wore that, like the Maidens, he seemed to be
waiting for her to make a mistake. Well, they were not the first, and a great way from the most
dangerous. Seventy-one years had passed since she had last made a serious mistake.
She gave Mendan a deliberately vague smile and started to pull back into the tent, when
suddenly something caught her eye and held her like a vise. If the Aielman had tried to cut her throat
right then, she might not have noticed.
Not far from where she stood stooped over in the mouth of the tent, nine or ten women knelt in a
row, rolling the grindstones on flat stone handmills much like those on any isolated farms. Other
women brought grain in baskets and took away the coarse flour. The nine or ten women knelt in dark
skirts and pale blouses, folded scarves holding their hair back. One, noticeably shorter than the rest,
the only one with hair that did not hang to her waist or below, wore not even a single necklace or
bracelet. She glanced up, the resentment on her sun-pinkened face sharpening as she met Verin’s gaze.
Only for an instant, though, before she cringed hurriedly to her task.
Verin jerked back into the tent, her stomach roiling queasily. Irgain was Green Ajah. Or rather,
had been Green, before Rand al’Thor stilled her. Being shielded dulled and fuzzed the bond to your
Warder, but being stilled snapped it as surely as death. One of Irgain’s two apparently had fallen over
dead from the shock, and the other had died trying to kill thousands of Aiel without making any effort
to escape. Very likely Irgain wished she also were dead. Stilled. Verin pressed both hands to her
middle. She would not sick up. She had seen worse than a stilled woman. Much worse.
“There’s no hope, is there?” Turanna muttered in a thick voice. She wept silently, staring into the
silver cup in her trembling hands at something distant and horrifying. “No hope.”
“There is always a way if you only look for it,” Verin said, absently patting the woman’s
shoulder. “You must always look.”
Her thoughts raced, and none touched Turanna. Irgain’s stilling made her belly feel full of rancid
grease, the Light knew. But what was the woman doing grinding grain? And dressed like the Aiel
women! Had she been put to work just there so Verin could see? Foolish question; even with a
ta’veren as strong as Rand al’Thor only a few miles away, there was some limit to the number of
coincidences she would accept. Had she miscalculated? At worst, it could not be a large error. Only,
small mistakes sometimes proved as fatal as large. How long could she hold out if Sorilea decided to
break her? A distressingly short time, she suspected. In some ways, Sorilea was as hard as anyone
she had ever met. And not a thing she could say that would stop it. A worry for another day. There
was no point getting ahead of herself.
Kneeling, she put a little effort into comforting Turanna, but not too much. Soothing words that

sounded as hollow to her as they did to Turanna, judging by the bleakness in her eyes. Nothing could
change Turanna’s circumstances except Turanna, and that had to come from within herself. The White
sister just wept harder, making no sound as her shoulders shook, tears streaming down her face. The
entry of two Wise Ones and a pair of young Aielmen who could not straighten up inside the tent was
something of a relief. For Verin, anyway. She rose and curtsied smoothly, but none of them had any
interest in her.
Daviena was a green-eyed woman with yellow-red hair, Losaine gray-eyed with dark hair that
only showed glints of red in the sun, both head-and-shoulders taller than she, both wearing the
expressions of women given a grimy task they wished on someone else. Neither could channel
strongly enough to have any certainty of holding Turanna by herself, but they linked as though they had
been forming circles all their lives, the light of saidar around one seeming to blend with that around
the other despite the fact that they stood apart. Verin forced her face into a smile to keep from
frowning. Where had they learned that? She would have wagered all she possessed that they had not
known how only a few days ago.
Everything went quickly then, and smoothly. As the crouching men lifted Turanna to her feet by
the arms, she let the silver cup fall. Empty, luckily for her. She did not struggle, which was just as
well, considering that either could have carried her off under one arm like a sack of grain, but her
mouth hung open, emitting a wordless keening. The Aiel paid no heed. Daviena, focusing the circle,
assumed the shield, and Verin let go of the Source completely. None of them trusted her enough to let
her hold saidar without a known reason, no matter what oaths she had sworn. Neither appeared to
notice, but they surely would have had she held on. The men hauled Turanna away, her bare feet
dragging across the layered carpets that floored the tent, and the Wise Ones followed them out. And
that was that. What could be done with Turanna had been done.
Letting out a long breath, Verin sagged onto one of the bright, tasseled cushions. A fine golden
ropework tray sat on the carpets next to her. Filling one of the mismatched silver cups from a pewter
pitcher, she drank deeply. This was thirsty work, and tiring. Hours of daylight remained, yet she felt
as if she had carried a heavy chest twenty miles. Over hills. The cup went back onto the tray, and she
pulled the small, leather-bound notebook from behind her belt. It always took a little time for them to
fetch those she asked for. A few moments to peruse her notes—and make some—would not be amiss.
There was no need for notes about the captives, but the sudden appearance of Cadsuane
Melaidhrin, three days ago now, gave cause for concern. What was Cadsuane after? The woman’s
companions could be dismissed, but Cadsuane herself was a legend, and even the believable parts of
the legend made her very dangerous indeed. Dangerous and unpredictable. She took a pen from the
small wooden writing case she always carried, reached toward the stoppered ink bottle in its
scabbard. And another Wise One entered the tent.
Verin scrambled to her feet so quickly that she dropped her notebook. Aeron could not channel
at all, yet Verin made a much deeper curtsy for the graying woman than she had for Daviena and
Losaine. At the bottom of her dip, she let go of her skirts to reach for her book, but Aeron’s fingers
reached it first. Verin straightened, calmly watching the taller woman thumb through the pages.
Sky blue eyes met hers. A winter sky. “Some pretty drawings and a great deal about plants and
flowers,” Aeron said coldly. “I see nothing concerning the questions you were sent to ask.” She thrust
the book at Verin more than handed it to her.
“Thank you, Wise One,” Verin said meekly, tucking the book back safely behind her belt. She
even added another curtsy for good measure, just as deep as the first. “I have the habit of noting down
what I see.” One day she would have to write out the cipher she used in her notebooks—a lifetime’s

worth of them filled cupboards and chests in her rooms above the White Tower library—one day, but
she hoped not soon. “As for the . . . um . . . prisoners, so far they all say variations of the same thing.
The Car’a’carn was to be housed in the Tower until the Last Battle. His . . . um . . . mistreatment . . .
began because of an escape attempt. But you know that already, of course. Never fear, though; I’m
sure I will learn more.” All true, if not all of the truth; she had seen too many sisters die to risk
sending others to the grave without a very good reason. The trouble was deciding what might cause
that risk. The manner of young al’Thor’s kidnapping, by an embassy supposedly treating with him,
enraged the Aiel to the point of murder, yet what she called his “mistreatment” barely angered them at
all as far as she could tell.
Gold and ivory bracelets clattered softly as Aeron adjusted her dark shawl. She peered down as
though trying to read Verin’s thoughts. Aeron seemed to stand high among the Wise Ones, and while
Verin occasionally had seen a smile crease those dark-tanned cheeks, a warm and easy smile, it was
never directed at an Aes Sedai. We never suspected that you would be the ones to fail, she had told
Verin somewhat murkily. There had been nothing unclear in the rest of it, however. Aes Sedai have no
honor. Give me one hair of suspicion, and I will strap you till you cannot stand, with my own
hands. Give me two hairs, and I will stake you out for the vultures and the ants. Verin blinked up at
her, trying to appear open. And meek; she must not forget meek. Docile, and compliant. She did not
feel fear. In her time she had faced harder stares, from women—and men—without so much as
Aeron’s slim compunction about ending her life. But a good deal of effort had gone into being sent to
ask those questions. She could not afford to waste it now. If only these Aiel let more show on their
faces.
Abruptly she became aware that they were no longer alone in the tent. Two flaxen-haired
Maidens had entered with a black-robed woman a hand shorter than either. They were half-holding
her upright. At one side stood Tialin, a lanky redhead wearing a grim expression behind the light of
saidar, shielding the black-robed prisoner. The sister’s hair hung in sweat-soaked ringlets to her
shoulders and strands that clung to her face, which bore so much dirt that Verin did not recognize her
at first. High cheekbones, but not very high, a nose with just the hint of a hook to it, and the slightest
tilt to the brown eyes. . . . Beldeine. Beldeine Nyram. She had instructed the girl in a few novice
classes.
“If I may ask,” she said carefully, “why was she brought? I asked for another.” Beldeine had no
Warder despite being Green—she had been raised to the shawl barely three years ago, and Greens
were often especially choosy about their first—but if they started bringing whoever they selected, the
next might have two or three Warders. She thought she could deal with two more today, but not if
either had even one Warder. And she doubted they would give her a second chance at any of them.
“Katerine Alruddin escaped last night,” Tialin nearly spat, and Verin gasped.
“You let her escape?” she burst out without thinking. Tiredness gave no excuse, but the words
spilled from her tongue before she could stop them. “How could you be so foolish? She’s Red! And
neither a coward nor weak in the Power! The Car’a’carn could be in danger! Why were we not told
of this when it happened?”
“It was not discovered until this morning,” one of the Maidens growled. Her eyes could have
been polished sapphires. “A Wise One and two Cor Darei were poisoned, and the gai’shain who
brought them drink was found with his throat cut.”
Aeron arched an eyebrow at the Maiden coldly. “Did she speak to you, Carahuin?” Both
Maidens suddenly became engrossed in the task of keeping Beldeine on her feet. Aeron merely
glanced at Tialin, but the red-haired Wise One lowered her gaze. Verin was the next recipient of

those attentions. “Your concern for Rand al’Thor does you . . . honor,” Aeron said grudgingly. “He
will be guarded. You have no need to know more. Or so much.” Abruptly her tone hardened. “But
apprentices do not use that tone with Wise Ones, Verin Mathwin Aes Sedai.” The last words were a
sneer.
Smothering a sigh, Verin all but fell into another deep curtsy, a part of her wishing she were
even as slim as she had been on arriving in the White Tower. She was not really constructed for all
this bending and bobbing. “Forgive me, Wise One,” she said humbly. Escaped! The circumstances
made everything plain, to her if not to the Aiel. “Apprehension must have loosened my wits.” A pity
she had no way to make sure Katerine met with a fatal accident. “I will do my best to remember in the
future.” Not so much as the flicker of an eyelash told whether Aeron accepted that. “May I assume her
shield, Wise One?”
Aeron nodded without looking at Tialin, and Verin quickly embraced the Source, taking up the
shield Tialin released. It never ceased to amaze her that women who could not channel gave orders
so freely to women who could. Tialin was not much weaker in the Power than Verin, yet she watched
Aeron nearly as warily as the Maidens did, and when the Maidens hurried out of the tent at a gesture
of Aeron’s hand, leaving Beldeine wavering where she stood, Tialin was only a step behind.
Aeron did not go, however, not immediately. “You will not speak of Katerine Alruddin to the
Car’a’carn,” she said. “He has enough to occupy his thoughts without giving him trifles to worry
over.”
“I will say nothing to him about her,” Verin agreed quickly. Trifles? A Red with Katerine’s
strength was no trifle. Perhaps a note. It needed thought.
“Be certain to hold your tongue, Verin Mathwin, or you will use it to howl.”
There seemed nothing to say to that, so Verin concentrated on meekness and docility, making yet
another curtsy. Her knees wanted to groan.
Once Aeron departed, Verin allowed herself a sigh of relief. She had been afraid Aeron
intended to remain. Gaining permission to be alone with the prisoners had required nearly as much
effort as getting Sorilea and Amys to decide they needed to be questioned, and by someone intimate
with the White Tower. If they ever learned they had been guided to that decision. . . . It was a worry
for another day. She seemed to be piling up a great many of those.
“There’s enough water to wash your face and hands, at least,” she told Beldeine mildly. “And if
you wish, I will Heal you.” Every sister she had interviewed had carried at least a few welts. The
Aiel did not beat the prisoners except for spilling water or balking at a task—the haughtiest words of
defiance earned only scornful laughter, if that—but the black-robed women were herded like animals,
a tap of the switch for go or turn or stop, and a harder tap if they did not obey quickly enough. Healing
made other things easier, too.
Filthy, sweaty, wavering like a reed in the wind, Beldeine curled her lip. “I would rather bleed
to death than be Healed by you!” she spat. “Maybe I should have expected to see you groveling to
these wilders, these savages, but I never thought you would stoop to revealing Tower secrets! That
ranks with treason, Verin! With rebellion!” She grunted contemptuously. “I suppose if you didn’t shy
at that, you’ll stop at nothing! What else have you and the others taught them besides linking?”
Verin clicked her tongue irritably, not bothering to set the young woman straight. Her neck ached
from looking up at Aiel—for that matter, even Beldeine stood a hand or more taller than she—her
knees ached from curtsying, and entirely too many women who should know better had flung blind
contempt and foolish pride at her today. Who should know better than an Aes Sedai that a sister had
to wear many faces in the world? You could not always overawe people, or bludgeon them, either.

Besides, far better to behave as a novice than be punished like one, especially when it earned you
only pain and humiliation. Even Kiruna had to see the sense of that eventually.
“Sit down before you fall down,” she said, suiting her own words. “Let me guess what you’ve
been doing today. By all that dirt, I’d say digging a hole. With your bare hands, or did they let you use
a spoon? When they decide it’s finished, they will just make you fill it again, you know. Now, let me
see. Every part I can see of you is grubby, but that robe is clean, so I expect they had you digging in
your skin. Are you sure you don’t want Healing? Sunburn can be painful.” She filled another cup with
water and wafted it across the tent on a flow of Air to hover in front of Beldeine. “Your throat must
be parched.”
The young Green stared unsteadily at the cup for a moment; then suddenly her legs gave way and
she collapsed onto a cushion with a bitter laugh. “They . . . water me frequently.” She laughed again,
though Verin could not see the joke. “As much as I want, so long as I swallow it all.” Studying Verin
angrily, she paused, then went on in a tight voice. “That dress looks very nice on you. They burned
mine; I saw them. They stole everything except this.” She touched the golden Great Serpent around
her left forefinger, a bright golden gleam among the dirt. “I suppose they couldn’t find quite enough
nerve for that. I know what they’re trying to do, Verin, and it won’t work. Not with me, not with any
of us!”
She was still on her guard. Verin set the cup down on the flowered carpet beside Beldeine, then
took up her own and sipped before speaking. “Oh? What are they trying to do?”
This time, the other woman’s laugh was brittle as well as harsh. “Break us, and you know it!
Make us swear oaths to al’Thor, the way you did. Oh, Verin, how could you? Swearing fealty! And
worse, to a man, to him! Even if you could bring yourself to rebel against the Amyrlin Seat, against
the White Tower . . .” She made the two sound much the same. “. . . how could you do that!”
For a moment Verin wondered whether things would be better if the women now held in the Aiel
camp had been caught up as she had been, a woodchip in the millrace of Rand al’Thor’s ta’veren
swirl, words pouring from her mouth before they had time to form in her brain. Not words she could
never have said on her own—that was not how ta’veren affected you—but words she might possibly
have said one time in a thousand under those circumstances, one time in ten thousand. No, the
arguments had been long and hot over whether oaths given in that way had to be kept; and the
arguments over how to keep them still continued. Much better as it was. Absently she fingered a hard
shape inside her belt pouch, a small brooch, a translucent stone carved into what appeared to be a lily
with too many petals. She never wore it, but it had not been out of her reach in nearly fifty years.
“You are da’tsang, Beldeine. You must have heard that.” She did not need Beldeine’s curt nod;
telling the despised one was part of Aiel law, like pronouncing sentence. That much she knew, if very
little more. “Your clothes, and anything else that would burn, were put to the fire because no Aiel
would own anything that once belonged to a da’tsang. The rest was hacked to pieces or hammered
into scrap, even the jewelry you had with you, and buried under a pit dug for a jakes.”
“My . . . ? My horse?” Beldeine asked anxiously.
“They didn’t kill the horses, but I don’t know where yours is.” Being ridden by someone in the
city, probably, or perhaps given to an Asha’man. Telling her that might do more harm than good.
Verin seemed to recall that Beldeine was one of those young women who had very deep feelings for
horses. “They let you keep the ring to remind you of who you were, and increase your shame. I don’t
know whether they would let you swear to Master al’Thor if you begged. It would take something
incredible on your part, I think.”
“I won’t! Never!” The words rang hollow, though, and Beldeine’s shoulders slumped. She was

shaken, but not sufficiently.
Verin put on a warm smile. A fellow had once told her that her smile made him think of his dear
mother. She hoped he had not been lying about that, at least. He had tried to slide a dagger between
her ribs a little later, and her smile had been the last thing he ever saw. “I can’t think of the reason
you would. No, I fear what you have to look forward to is useless labor. That’s shaming, to them.
Bone shaming. Of course, if they realize you don’t see it that way. . . . Oh, my. I’ll wager you didn’t
like digging without any clothes on, even with Maidens for guards, but think of, say, standing in a tent
full of men that way?” Beldeine flinched. Verin prattled on; she had developed prattling to something
of a Talent. “They’d only make you stand there, of course. Da’tsang aren’t allowed to do anything
useful unless there’s great need, and an Aielman would as soon put his arm around a rotting carcass
as. . . . Well, that’s not a pleasant thought, is it? In any case, that’s what you have to look forward to. I
know you’ll resist as long as you can, though I’m not sure what there is to resist. They won’t try to get
information out of you, or anything that people usually do with prisoners. But they won’t let you go,
not ever, until they’re sure the shame is so deep in you there’s nothing else left. Not if it takes the rest
of your life.”
Beldeine’s lips moved soundlessly, but she might as well have spoken the words. The rest of my
life. Shifting uncomfortably on her cushion, she grimaced. Sunburn or welts or simply the ache of
unaccustomed work. “We will be rescued,” she said finally. “The Amyrlin won’t leave us. . . . We’ll
be rescued, or we’ll—We will be rescued!” Snatching up the silver cup from beside her, she tilted
her head back to gulp until it was empty, then thrust it out for more. Verin floated the pewter pitcher
over and set it down so the young woman could pour for herself.
“Or you’ll escape?” Verin said, and Beldeine’s dirty hands jerked, splashing water down the
sides of the cup. “Really, now. You have as much chance of that as you do of rescue. You’re
surrounded by an army of Aiel. And apparently al’Thor can call up a few hundred of those Asha’man
whenever he wants, to hunt you down.” The other woman shivered at that, and Verin nearly did. That
little mess should have been stopped as soon as it started. “No, I fear you must make your own way,
somehow. Deal with things as they are. You are quite alone in this. I know they don’t let you speak to
the others. Quite alone,” she sighed. Wide eyes stared at her as they might have at a red adder.
“There’s no need to make it worse than it must be. Let me Heal you.”
She barely waited for the other woman’s pitiful nod before moving to kneel beside her and place
hands on Beldeine’s head. The young woman was almost as ready as she could be. Opening herself to
more of saidar, Verin wove the flows of Healing, and the Green gasped and quivered. The half-filled
cup dropped from her hands, and a flailing arm knocked the pitcher onto its side. Now she was as
ready as she could be.
In the moments of confusion that gripped anyone after being Healed, while Beldeine still blinked
and tried to come back to herself, Verin opened herself further, opened herself through the carvedflower angreal in her pouch. Not a very powerful angreal, but enough, and she needed every bit of
the extra Power it gave her for this. The flows she began weaving bore no resemblance to Healing.
Spirit predominated by far, but there was Wind and Water, Fire and Earth, the last of some difficulty
for her, and even the skeins of Spirit had to be divided again and again, placed with an intricacy to
boggle a weaver of fine carpets. Even if a Wise One poked her head into the tent, with the smallest of
luck she would not possess the rare Talent needed to realize what Verin was doing. There would still
be difficulties, perhaps painful difficulties one way and another, but she could live with anything
short of true discovery.
“What . . . ?” Beldeine said drowsily. Her head would have lolled except for Verin’s grip, and

her eyelids were half-closed. “What are you . . . ? What is happening?”
“Nothing that will harm you,” Verin told her reassuringly. The woman might die inside the year,
or in ten, as a result of this, but the weave itself would not harm her. “I promise you, this is safe
enough to use on an infant.” Of course, that depended on what you did with it.
She needed to lay the flows in place thread by thread, but talking seemed to help rather than
hinder. And too long a silence might rouse suspicion, if her twin guardians were listening. Her eyes
darted frequently to the dangling doorflaps. She wanted some answers she had no intention of sharing,
answers none of the women she questioned were likely to give freely even if they knew them. One of
the smaller effects of this weave was to loosen the tongue and open the mind as well as any herb ever
could, an effect that came on quickly.
Dropping her voice almost to a whisper, she continued. “The al’Thor boy seems to think he has
supporters of some kind inside the White Tower, Beldeine. In secret, of course; they must be.” Even a
man with his ear pressed to the fabric of the tent should be able to hear only that they were talking.
“Tell me anything you know about them.”
“Supporters?” Beldeine murmured, attempting a frown that seemed beyond her ability. She
stirred, though it hardly deserved the word agitation, feeble and uncoordinated. “For him? Among the
sisters? It can’t be. Except for those of you who. . . . How could you, Verin? Why didn’t you fight it?”
Verin tsked vexedly. Not for the foolish suggestion that she should have fought a ta’veren. The
boy seemed so certain. Why? She kept her voice low. “Do you have no suspicions, Beldeine? Did
you hear no rumors before you left Tar Valon? No whispers? No one who hinted at approaching him
differently? Tell me.”
“No one. Who could . . . ? No one would. . . . I admired Kiruna so.” There was a hint of loss in
Beldeine’s sleepy voice, and tears leaking from her eyes made tracks through the dirt. Only Verin’s
hands kept her sitting upright.
Verin continued to lay down the threads of her weaving, eyes flashing from her work to the
doorflaps and back. She felt a little like sweating herself. Sorilea might decide she needed help with
the questioning. She might bring out one of the sisters from the Sun Palace. Should any sister learn of
this, stilling was a very real possibility. “So you were going to deliver him to Elaida neatly washed
and well-behaved,” she said in a slightly louder tone. The quiet had gone on too long. She did not
want that pair outside reporting that she was whispering with the prisoners.
“I couldn’t . . . speak out . . . against Galina’s decision. She led . . . by the Amyrlin’s command.”
Beldeine shifted again, weakly. Her voice was still dreamy, but it picked up an agitated edge. Her
eyelids fluttered. “He had to . . . be made . . . to obey! He had to be! Shouldn’t have been . . . treated
so harshly. Like putting . . . him to . . . question. Wrong.”
Verin snorted. Wrong? Disastrous was more like it. A disaster from the first. Now the man
looked at any Aes Sedai almost the way Aeron did. And if they had succeeded in carrying him to Tar
Valon? A ta’veren like Rand al’Thor actually inside the White Tower? A thought to make a stone
tremble. However it had turned out, disaster would surely have been too mild a word. The price paid
at Dumai’s Wells was small enough, for avoiding that.
She went on asking questions in a tone that could be heard clearly by anyone listening outside.
Asking questions she already had answers for, and avoiding those too dangerous to be answered. She
paid little heed to the words coming out of her mouth or to Beldeine’s replies. Mainly she
concentrated on her weaving.
A great many things had captured her interest over the years, not all strictly approved of by the
Tower. Almost every wilder who came to the White Tower for training—both true wilders, who

really had begun teaching themselves, and girls who merely had started touching the Source because
the spark born in them had quickened on its own; for some sisters, there was no real difference—
nearly every one of those wilders had created at least one trick for herself, and those tricks almost
invariably fell under one of two headings. A way to listen in on other people’s conversations, or a
way of making people do as they wanted.
The first, the Tower did not care much about. Even a wilder who had gained considerable
control on her own quickly learned that as long as she wore novice white, she was not to so much as
touch saidar without a sister or one of the Accepted standing over her. Which did tend to limit
eavesdropping rather sharply. The other trick, however, smelled too akin to forbidden Compulsion.
Oh, it was just a way to make Father give her dresses or trinkets he did not want to buy, or make
Mother approve of young men she ordinarily ran off, things of that nature, but the Tower rooted the
trick out most effectively. Many of the girls and women Verin had spoken to over the years could not
make themselves form the weaves, much less use them, and a fair number could not even make
themselves remember how. From bits and pieces and scraps of half-remembered weaves created by
untrained girls for very limited purposes, Verin had reconstructed a thing forbidden by the Tower
since its founding. In the beginning it had been simple curiosity on her part. Curiosity, she thought
wryly, working at the weave on Beldeine, has made me climb into more than one pickling kettle.
Usefulness came later.
“I suppose Elaida meant to keep him down in the open cells,” she said conversationally. The
grill-walled cells were intended for men who could channel, as well as initiates of the Tower under
close arrest, wilders who had claimed to be Aes Sedai, and anyone else who must be both confined
and blocked off from the Source. “Not a comfortable place for the Dragon Reborn. No privacy. Do
you believe he is the Dragon Reborn, Beldeine?” This time she paused to listen.
“Yes.” The word was a long hiss, and Beldeine rolled frightened eyes toward Verin’s face.
“Yes . . . but he must . . . be kept . . . safe. The world . . . must be . . . safe . . . from him.”
Interesting. They had all said the world had to be kept safe from him; what was interesting was
those who thought he needed protection, too. Some who had said that, surprised her.
To Verin’s eyes, the weave she had made resembled nothing so much as a haphazard tangle of
faintly glowing transparent threads all bundled around Beldeine’s head, with four threads of Spirit
trailing out of the mess. Two of those, opposite one another, she pulled, and the tangle collapsed
slightly, falling inward, into something on the edge of order. Beldeine’s eyes shot open wide, staring
into the far distance.
In a firm, low voice, Verin gave her instructions. More like suggestions, though she phrased them
as commands. Beldeine would have to find reasons within herself to obey; if she did not, then all this
had been so much wasted effort.
With the final words, Verin pulled the other two threads of Spirit, and the tangle collapsed
further. This time, though, it fell into what seemed perfect order, a pattern more precise, more
complicated than the most intricate lace, and complete, tied off by the same action that began its
shrinking. This time, it continued to fall inward on itself, inward around Beldeine’s head. Those
faintly glowing threads sank into her, vanished. Her eyes rolled back in her head, and she began to
thrash, limbs quivering. Verin held her as gently as she could, but Beldeine’s head still whipped from
side to side, and her bare heels drummed on the carpets. Soon, only the most careful Delving would
tell that anything had been done, and not even that would identify the weave. Verin had tested that
carefully, and if she did say so herself, none surpassed her at Delving.
Of course the thing was not truly Compulsion as ancient texts described it. The weaving went

with painful slowness, cobbled together as it was, and there was that need for a reason. It helped a
great deal if the object of the weave was emotionally vulnerable, but trust was absolutely essential.
Even catching someone by surprise did no good if they were suspicious. That fact cut down its
usefulness with men considerably; very few men lacked suspicion around Aes Sedai.
Distrust aside, men were very bad subjects, unfortunately. She could not understand why. Most
of those girls’ weaves had been intended for their fathers or other men. Any strong personality might
begin to question his own actions—or even forget doing them, which led to another set of problems—
but all things being equal, men were much more likely to. Much more likely. Perhaps it was the
suspicion again. Why, once a man had even remembered the weaves being woven on him, if not the
instructions she had given him. Such a lot of bother that caused! Not something she would risk again.
At last Beldeine’s convulsions lessened, stopped. She raised a filthy hand to her head. “What—?
What happened?” she said, almost inaudibly. “Did I faint?” Forgetfulness was another good point
about the weave, not unexpectedly. After all, Father must not remember that you somehow made him
buy that expensive dress.
“The heat is very bad,” Verin said, helping her to sit up again. “I have felt light-headed myself
once or twice today.” From weariness, not heat. Handling that much of saidar took it out of you,
especially when you had already done it four times today. The angreal did nothing to buffer the
effects once you stopped using it. She could have used a steadying hand herself. “I think that’s about
enough. If you’re fainting, perhaps they’ll find something for you to do out of the sun.” The prospect
did not seem to cheer Beldeine at all.
Rubbing the small of her back, Verin stuck her head out of the tent. Coram and Mendan stopped
their game of cat’s cradle once more; there was no sign that either had listened, but she would not
wager her life on it. She told them that she was finished with Beldeine and, after a moment’s thought,
added that she needed another pitcher of water since Beldeine had overturned hers. Both men’s faces
darkened beneath their tans. That would be passed along to the Wise One who came for Beldeine. It
would serve as something more to help her reach her decision.
The sun still had a long way to fall to the horizon, but the ache in her back told her it was time to
stop for the day. She could still do one more sister, but if she did, by morning she would feel it in
every muscle. Her eyes fell on Irgain, now with the women carrying baskets to the handmills. How
would her life have gone if she had not been so curious, Verin wondered. For one thing, she would
have married Eadwin and remained in Far Madding instead of going to the White Tower. She would
be long dead, for another, and the children she had never had, and her grandchildren, too.
With a sigh, she turned back to Coram. “When Mendan returns, would you go tell Colinda that I
would like to see Irgain Fatamed?” The pain in her muscles tomorrow would be a small penance for
Beldeine’s suffering over that spilled water, but that was not why she did it, or even her curiosity,
really. She still had a task. Somehow, she had to keep young Rand alive until it was time for him to
die.
The room might have been in a grand palace, except that it had neither windows nor doors. The
fire on a golden marble hearth gave no heat, and the flames did not consume the logs. The man seated
at a table with gilded legs, centered on a silk carpet woven with glittering threads of gold and silver,
cared little for the trappings of this Age. They were necessary to impress; no more. Not that he really
needed more than himself to overawe the stiffest pride. He called himself Moridin, and surely no one
had ever had more right to name himself Death.
From time to time he idly stroked one of the two mindtraps that hung on plain silken cords
around his neck. At his touch, the blood-red crystal of the cour’souvra pulsed, swirls moving in

endless depths like the beating of a heart. His real attention was on the game laid out before him on
the table, thirty-three red pieces and thirty-three green arrayed across a playing surface of thirteen
squares by thirteen. A re-creation of the early stages of a famous game. The most important piece, the
Fisher, black-and-white like the playing surface, still waited in its starting place on the central
square. A complex game, sha’rah, ancient long before the War of Power. Sha’rah, tcheran, and
no’ri, the game now called simply “stones,” each had adherents who claimed it encompassed all the
subtleties of life, but Moridin had always favored sha’rah. Only nine people living even remembered
the game. He had been a master of it. Much more complex than tcheran or no’ri. The first object was
capture of the Fisher. Only then did the game truly begin.
A servant approached, a slim graceful young man clad all in white, impossibly handsome,
bowing as he presented a crystal goblet on a silver tray. He smiled, but it did not touch his black
eyes, eyes more lifeless than simply dead. Most men would have felt uncomfortable having that gaze
on them. Moridin merely took the goblet and motioned the servant away. The vintners of this time
produced some excellent wines. He did not drink, though.
The Fisher held his attention, baiting him. Several pieces had varying moves, but only the
Fisher’s attributes altered according to where it stood; on a white square, weak in attack yet agile and
far-ranging in escape; on black, strong in attack but slow and vulnerable. When masters played, the
Fisher changed sides many times before the end. The green-and-red goal-row that surrounded the
playing surface could be threatened by any piece, but only the Fisher could move onto it. Not that he
was safe, even there; the Fisher was never safe. When the Fisher was yours, you tried to move him to
a square of your color behind your opponent’s end of the board. That was victory, the easiest way,
but not the only one. When your opponent held the Fisher, you attempted to leave him no choice for
the Fisher but to move onto your color. Anywhere at all along the goal-row would do; holding the
Fisher could be more dangerous than not. Of course, there was a third path to victory in sha’rah, if
you took it before letting yourself be trapped. The game always degenerated in a bloody melee, then,
victory coming only with complete annihilation of your enemy. He had tried that, once, in desperation,
but the attempt had failed. Painfully.
Fury boiled suddenly in Moridin’s head, and black flecks swam across his eyes as he seized the
True Power. Ecstasy that amounted to pain thundered through him. His hand closed around the two
mindtraps, and the True Power closed around the Fisher, snatching it into the air, a hair from crushing
it to powder, crushing the powder out of existence. The goblet shattered in his hand. His grip
bordered on crushing the cour’souvra. The saa were a blizzard of black, but they did not hinder his
sight. The Fisher was always worked as a man, a bandage blinding his eyes and one hand pressed to
his side, a few drops of blood dripping through his fingers. The reasons, like the source of the name,
were lost in the mist of time. That troubled him sometimes, enraged him, what knowledge might be
lost in the turnings of the Wheel, knowledge he needed, knowledge he had a right to. A right!
Slowly he set the Fisher back on the board. Slowly his fingers uncurled from around the
cour’souvra. There was no need for destruction. Yet. Icy calm replaced rage in the blink of an eye.
Blood and wine dripped from his gashed hand, unnoticed. Perhaps the Fisher did come from some
dim remnant of a memory of Rand al’Thor, the shadow of a shadow. It did not matter. He realized he
was laughing, and made no effort to stop. On the board, the Fisher stood waiting, but in the greater
game, al’Thor moved already to his wishes. And soon, now. . . . It was very hard to lose a game when
you played both sides of the board. Moridin laughed so hard that tears rolled down his face, but he
was not aware of them.

CHAPTER
1

To Keep the Bargain

T he Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend.
Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes
again. In one Age, called the Third Age by some, an Age yet to come, an Age long past, a wind
rose above the great mountainous island of Tremalking. The wind was not the beginning. There
are neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of the Wheel of Time. But it was a beginning.
East the wind blew across Tremalking, where the fair-skinned Amayar farmed their fields, and
made fine glass and porcelain, and followed the peace of the Water Way. The Amayar ignored the
world beyond their scattered islands, for the Water Way taught that this world was only illusion, a
mirrored reflection of belief, yet some watched the wind carry dust and deep summer heat where cold
winter rains should be falling, and they remembered tales heard from the Atha’an Miere. Tales of the
world beyond, and what prophecy said was to come. Some looked to a hill where a massive stone
hand rose from the earth, holding a clear crystal sphere larger than many houses. The Amayar had
their own prophecies, and some of those spoke of the hand and the sphere. And the end of illusions.
Onward the wind blew into the Sea of Storms, eastward beneath a searing sun in a sky
abandoned by clouds, whipping the tops of green sea swells, battling winds from the south and
westward winds, shearing and swirling as the waters below heaved. Not yet the storms of winter’s
heart, though winter should have been half gone, much less the greater storms of a dying summer, but
winds and currents that could be used by ocean-faring folk to coast around the continent from World’s
End to Mayene and beyond, then back again. Eastward the wind howled, over rolling ocean where the
great whales rose and sounded, and flying fish soared on outstretched fins two paces and more
across, eastward, now whirling north, east and north, over small fleets of fishing ships dragging their
nets in the shallower seas. Some of those fishermen stood gaping, hands idle on the lines, staring at a
huge array of tall vessels and smaller that purposefully rode the wind’s hard breath, shattering swells
with bluff bows, slicing swells with narrow, their banner a golden hawk with talons clutching
lightning, a multitude of streaming banners like portents of storm. East and north and on, and the wind
reached the broad, ship-filled harbor of Ebou Dar, where hundreds of Sea Folk vessels rode as they
did in many ports, awaiting word of the Coramoor, the Chosen One.
Across the harbor the wind roared, tossing small ships and large, across the city itself, gleaming

white beneath the unfettered sun, spires and walls and color-ringed domes, streets and canals bustling
with the storied southern industry. Around the shining domes and slender towers of the Tarasin Palace
the wind swirled, carrying the tang of salt, lifting the flag of Altara, two golden leopards on a field of
red and blue, and the banners of ruling House Mitsobar, the Sword and Anchor, green on white. Not
yet the storm, but a harbinger of storms.
Skin prickled between Aviendha’s shoulder blades as she strode ahead of her companions
through palace hallways tiled in dozens of pleasing bright hues. A sense of being watched that she had
last felt while still wed to the spear. Imagination, she told herself. Imagination and knowing there
are enemies about I cannot face! Not so long ago that crawling sensation had meant someone might
be intending to kill her. Death was nothing to fear—everyone died, today or on another—but she did
not want to die like a rabbit kicking in a snare. She had toh to meet.
Servants scurried by close along the walls, bobbing bows and curtsies, dropping their eyes
almost as if they understood the shame of the lives they lived, yet surely it could not be them that
made her want to twist her shoulders. She had tried schooling herself to see servants, but even now,
with the skin creeping on her back, her gaze slid around them. It had to be imagination, and nerves.
This was a day for imagination and nerves.
Unlike the servants, rich silk tapestries snagged at her eye, and the gilded stand-lamps and
ceiling lamps lining the corridors. Paper-thin porcelain in reds and yellows and greens and blues
stood in wall niches and tall open-work cabinets alongside ornaments of gold and silver, ivory and
crystal, scores upon scores of bowls and vases and caskets and statuettes. Only the most beautiful
truly caught her gaze; whatever wetlanders thought, beauty held more worth than gold. There was
much beauty here. She would not have minded taking her share of the fifth from this place.
Vexed with herself, she frowned. That was not an honorable thought beneath a roof that had
offered her shade and water freely. Without ceremony, true, but also without debt or blood, steel or
need. Yet better that than thinking about a small boy alone somewhere out in this corrupt city. Any city
was corrupt—of that much she was certain, now, having seen some part of four—but Ebou Dar was
the last where she would have let a child run loose. What she could not understand was why thoughts
of Olver came unless she worked to avoid them. He was no part of the toh she had to Elayne, and to
Rand al’Thor. A Shaido spear had taken his father, starvation and hardship his mother, yet had it been
her own spear that took both, the boy was still a treekiller, Cairhienin. Why should she fret over a
child from that blood? Why? She attempted to concentrate on the weave she was to make, but although
she had practiced under Elayne’s eye until she could have formed it sleeping, Olver’s wide-mouthed
face intruded. Birgitte worried about him even more than she, but Birgitte’s breast held a strangely
soft heart for small boys, especially ugly ones.
Sighing, Aviendha gave up trying to ignore her companions’ conversation behind her, though
irritation crackled through it like heat lightning. Even that was better than upsetting herself over a son
of treekillers. Oathbreakers. A despised blood the world would be better off without. No concern or
worry of hers. None. Mat Cauthon would find the boy in any case. He could find anything, it seemed.
And listening settled her, somehow. The prickling faded away.
“I don’t like it one bit!” Nynaeve was muttering, continuing an argument begun back in their
rooms. “Not a bit, Lan, do you hear me?” She had announced her dislike at least twenty times already,
but Nynaeve never surrendered just because she had lost. Short and dark-eyed, she strode fiercely,
kicking her divided blue skirts, one hand rising to hover near her thick, waist-long braid, then thrust
down firmly before rising again. Nynaeve kept a tight hold on anger and irritation when Lan was
around. Or tried to. An inordinate pride filled her about marrying him. The close-fitting embroidered

blue coat over her yellow-slashed silk riding dress hung open, showing far too much bosom in the
wetlander way, just so she could display his heavy gold finger ring on a fine chain around her neck.
“You have no right to promise to take care of me like that, Lan Mandragoran,” she went on firmly. “I
am not a porcelain figurine!”
He paced at her side, a man of proper size, towering head and shoulders and more above her, the
eye-wrenching cloak of a Warder hanging down his back. His face seemed hacked from stone, and his
gaze weighed the threat in every servant who passed, examined every crossing corridor and wall
niche for hidden attackers. Readiness radiated from him, a lion on the brink of his charge. Aviendha
had grown up around dangerous men, but never one to match Aan’allein. Had death been a man, she
would have been him.
“You are Aes Sedai, and I am a Warder,” he said in a deep, level voice. “Taking care of you is
my duty.” His tone softened, conflicting sharply with his angular face and bleak, never-changing eyes.
“Besides, caring for you is my heart’s desire, Nynaeve. You can ask or demand anything of me, but
never to let you die without trying to save you. The day you die, I die.”
That last he had not said before, not in Aviendha’s hearing, and it hit Nynaeve like a blow to the
stomach; her eyes started half out of her head, and her mouth worked soundlessly. She appeared to
recover quickly, though, as always. Pretending to resettle her blue-plumed hat, a ridiculous thing like
a strange bird roosting atop her head, she shot a glance at him from beneath the wide brim.
Aviendha had begun to suspect that the other woman often used silence and supposedly
significant looks to cover ignorance. She suspected. Nynaeve knew little more about men, about
dealing with one man, than she did herself. Facing them with knives and spears was much easier than
loving one. Much easier. How did women manage being married to them? Aviendha had a desperate
need to learn, and no idea how. Married to Aan’allein only a day, Nynaeve had changed much more
than simply in trying to control her temper. She seemed to flit from startlement to shock, however
much she attempted to hide it. She fell into dreaminess at odd moments, blushed at innocuous
questions, and—she denied this fiercely, even when Aviendha had seen her—she giggled over
nothing at all. There was no point in trying to learn anything from Nynaeve.
“I suppose you’re going to tell me about Warders and Aes Sedai again, as well,” Elayne said
coolly to Birgitte. “Well, you and I aren’t married. I expect you to guard my back, but I will not have
you making promises about me behind it.” Elayne wore garments as inappropriate as Nynaeve’s, a
gold-embroidered Ebou Dari riding dress of green silk, suitably high-necked but with an oval opening
that bared the inner slopes of her breasts. Wetlanders spluttered at the mention of a sweat tent or
being unclothed in front of gai’shain, then walked about half-exposed where any stranger could see.
Aviendha did not really mind for Nynaeve, but Elayne was her near-sister. And would be more, she
hoped.
The raised heels of Birgitte’s boots made her almost a hand taller than Nynaeve, if still shorter
than Elayne or Aviendha. In dark blue coat and wide green trousers, she carried herself with much of
the same warily confident readiness as Lan, though it seemed more casual in her. A leopard lying on a
rock, and not nearly so lazy as she appeared. There was no arrow nocked in the bow Birgitte carried,
but for all her stroll and smiles, she could have a shaft out of the quiver at her waist before anyone
could blink, and be loosing her third before anybody else could have fitted a second to bowstring.
She gave Elayne a wry grin and a shake of her head that swung a golden braid as long and thick
as Nynaeve’s dark one. “I promised to your face, not behind your back,” she said dryly. “When
you’ve learned a little more, I won’t have to tell you about Warders and Aes Sedai.” Elayne sniffed
and lifted her chin haughtily, busying herself with the ribbons of her hat, which was covered with long

green plumes and worse than Nynaeve’s. “Perhaps a great deal more,” Birgitte added. “You’re tying
another knot in that bow.”
Had Elayne not been her near-sister, Aviendha would have laughed at the crimson that flooded
her cheeks. Tripping someone who tried to walk too high was always fun, or watching it done, and
even a short fall was worth a laugh. As it was, she leveled a firm stare at Birgitte, a promise that
more might bring retribution. She liked the woman despite all her secrets, but the difference between
a friend and a near-sister was a thing these wetlanders seemed unable to comprehend. Birgitte only
smiled, glancing from her to Elayne, and murmured under her breath. Aviendha caught the word
“kittens.” Worse, it sounded fond. Everyone must have heard. Everyone!
“What’s gotten into you, Aviendha?” Nynaeve demanded, prodding her shoulder with a stiff
finger. “Do you intend to stand there blushing all day? We are in a hurry.”
Only then did Aviendha realize by the heat in her face that she must be as red as Elayne. And
standing still as stone besides, when they had need for haste. Cut by a word, like a girl newly wedded
to the spear and unused to the banter among Maidens. She had almost twenty years, and she was
behaving like a child playing with her first bow. That added flames to her cheeks. Which was why
she all but leaped around the next turning and very nearly ran headlong into Teslyn Baradon.
Skidding awkwardly on red-and-green floor tiles, Aviendha half-fell backward, catching herself
against Elayne and Nynaeve. This time she managed not to blush herself to fire, but she wanted to.
She was shaming her near-sister as much as herself. Elayne always held her composure, no matter
what. Luckily, Teslyn Baradon took the encounter little better.
The sharp-faced woman recoiled in surprise, gaping before she could stop herself, then shifting
her narrow shoulders irritably. Gaunt cheeks and a narrow nose hid the ageless quality of the Red
sister’s features, and her red dress, brocaded in a blue that was nearly black, only made her appear
bonier, yet she quickly gathered a clan roofmistress’s self-possession, dark brown eyes as cool as
deep shadows. They slid past Aviendha dismissively, ignoring Lan like a tool she had no use for,
burned a brief moment at Birgitte. Most Aes Sedai disapproved of Birgitte being a Warder, though
none could give a reason beyond sour mutters about tradition. Elayne and Nynaeve, however, the
woman fixed by turns. Aviendha could have tracked yesterday’s wind before reading anything on
Teslyn Baradon’s face now.
“I did already tell Merilille,” she said in a thick Illianer accent, “but I may as well put your
minds at rest, also. Whatever . . . mischief . . . you do be about, Joline and I will no interfere. I did
see to that. Elaida may never learn of it, if you do have some care. Stop gaping at me like carp,
children,” she added with a grimace of distaste. “I be neither blind nor deaf. I do know of Sea Folk
Windfinders in the palace, and secret meetings with Queen Tylin. And other things.” That thin mouth
tightened, and though her tone remained serene, her dark gaze flared with anger. “You will pay dearly
yet for those other things, you and those who do allow you to play at being Aes Sedai, but I will look
aside for now. Atonement can wait.”
Nynaeve took a tight grip on her braid, back straight, head high, and her own eyes blazed. Under
different circumstances Aviendha might have found some sympathy for the target of the tongue-lashing
plainly about to erupt. Nynaeve’s tongue carried more spines than a hair-needle segade, and sharper
ones. Coldly, Aviendha considered this woman who thought she could look right through her. A Wise
One did not stoop to thrashing someone with her fists, but she was still only an apprentice; perhaps it
would not cost her ji if she just bruised this Teslyn Baradon a little. She opened her mouth to give the
Red sister a chance to defend herself at the same instant Nynaeve opened hers, yet Elayne spoke first.
“What we are about, Teslyn,” she said in a chill voice, “is none of your business.” She, too,

stood straight, her eyes blue ice; a chance ray of light from a high window caught her golden-red
curls, seeming to set them afire. Right then, Elayne could have made a roof-mistress seem a goatherd
with too much oosquai in her belly. It was a skill she honed well. She delivered each word with cold
crystal dignity. “You have no right to interfere in anything we do, in anything that any sister does. No
right whatsoever. So pull your nose out of our coats, you summer ham, and be glad we do not choose
to take issue with you supporting a usurper on the Amyrlin Seat.”
Perplexed, Aviendha glanced sideways at her near-sister. Pull her nose out of their coats? She
and Elayne, at least, were not wearing coats. A summer ham? What did that mean? Wetlanders often
said peculiar things, but the other women all looked as puzzled as she. Only Lan, staring at Elayne
askance, appeared to understand, and he seemed . . . startled. And perhaps amused. It was difficult to
tell; Aan’allein controlled his features well.
Teslyn Baradon sniffed, pinching her face even tighter. Aviendha was trying hard to call these
people by only part of their names the way they themselves did—when she used a whole name, they
thought she was upset!—but she could not begin to imagine being so intimate with Teslyn Baradon. “I
will leave you foolish children to your business,” the woman growled. “Be sure you do no get your
noses caught in a worse crack than they already do be.”
As she turned to go, gathering her skirts grandly, Nynaeve caught her arm. Wetlanders usually let
emotion gild their faces, and Nynaeve’s was the image of conflict, anger struggling to break through
fixed determination. “Wait, Teslyn,” she said reluctantly. “You and Joline may be in danger. I told
Tylin, but I think she may be afraid to tell anyone else. Unwilling, anyway. It’s nothing anybody really
wants to talk about.” She drew a long, deep breath, and if she was thinking of her own fears in the
matter, she had cause. There was no shame in feeling fear, only in giving way to it, or letting it show.
Aviendha felt a flutter in her own belly as Nynaeve went on. “Moghedien has been here in Ebou Dar.
She might still be. And maybe another of the Forsaken, too. With a gholam, a kind of Shadowspawn
the Power won’t touch. It looks like a man, but it was made, and made to kill Aes Sedai. Steel doesn’t
seem to hurt it either, and it can squeeze through a mousehole. The Black Ajah is here, as well. And
there’s a storm coming, a bad storm. Only it isn’t a storm, not weather. I can feel it; that’s a skill I
have, a Talent, maybe. There’s danger headed for Ebou Dar, and trouble worse than any wind or rain
or lightning.”
“The Forsaken, a storm that is no a storm, and some Shadowspawn I did never hear of before,”
Teslyn Baradon said wryly. “Not to mention the Black Ajah. Light! The Black Ajah! And the Dark
One himself, perhaps?” Her twisted smile was razor thin. She plucked Nynaeve’s hand from her
sleeve contemptuously. “When you do be back in the White Tower where you belong, in white as you
all truly belong, you will learn no to waste your hours with wild fancies. Or to carry your tales to
sisters.” Running her eyes over them, and once more skipping past Aviendha, she gave a loud sniff
and marched off down the hallway so quickly that servants had to leap from her path.
“That woman has the nerve to . . . !” Nynaeve spluttered, glaring after the retreating woman and
strangling her braid with both hands. “After I made myself . . . !” She almost choked on her spleen.
“Well, I tried.” And now regretted the attempt, by the sound.
“You did,” Elayne agreed with a sharp nod, “and more than she deserves. Denying that we’re
Aes Sedai! I won’t put up with that anymore! I won’t!” Her voice had only seemed cold before; now
it was cold, and grim.
“Can one like that be trusted?” Aviendha muttered. “Maybe we should be sure she cannot
interfere.” She examined her fist; Teslyn Baradon would see that. The woman deserved to be caught
by the Shadowsouled, by Moghedien or another. Fools deserved whatever their foolishness brought.

Nynaeve appeared to consider the suggestion, but what she said was “If I didn’t know better, I’d
think she was ready to turn on Elaida.” She clicked her tongue in exasperation.
“You can dizzy yourself trying to read the currents in Aes Sedai politics.” Elayne did not say
Nynaeve should know that by now, but her tone did. “Even a Red might be turning against Elaida, for
some reason we can’t begin to imagine. Or she could be trying to make us lower our guard, so she can
somehow trick us into putting ourselves into Elaida’s hands. Or—”
Lan coughed. “If any of the Forsaken are coming,” he said in a voice like polished stone, “they
could be here any moment. Or that gholam could. In either case, it would be best to be elsewhere.”
“With Aes Sedai, always a little patience,” Birgitte murmured as though quoting. “But the
Windfinders don’t seem to have any,” she continued, “so you might do well to forget Teslyn and
remember Renaile.”
Elayne and Nynaeve turned stares on the Warders cold enough to give ten Stone Dogs pause.
Neither liked running from the Shadowsouled and this gholam, for all they were the ones who had
decided there was no choice. Certainly neither liked being reminded that they needed to run to meet
the Windfinders almost as much as to escape the Forsaken. Aviendha would have studied those looks
—Wise Ones did with a glance or a few words what she had always needed the threat of spear or fist
for, only they usually did it faster and with more success—she would have studied Elayne and
Nynaeve, except that their glares had no visible effect on the pair at all. Birgitte grinned and cut her
eyes toward Lan, who shrugged back at her with obvious forbearance.
Elayne and Nynaeve gave over. Unhurriedly, and unnecessarily, straightening their skirts, they
each took one of Aviendha’s arms before setting off again without so much as a glance to see that the
Warders followed. Not that Elayne needed to, with the Warder bond. Or Nynaeve, if not for the same
reason; Aan’allein’s bond might belong to another, but his heart hung alongside his ring on that chain
around her neck. They made a great show of strolling casually, unwilling to let Birgitte and Lan think
they had been brought to hurry, yet the truth was, they did walk faster than before.
As if to make up for that, they chatted with deliberate idleness, choosing the most frivolous
subjects. Elayne regretted not having a chance to truly see the Festival of Birds, just yesterday, and
never gave a blush for the scant garments many people had worn. Nynaeve did not blush either, but
she quickly began talking about the Feast of Embers, to be held that night. Some of the servants
claimed there would be fireworks, supposedly made by a refugee Illuminator. Several traveling
shows had come to the city with their strange animals and acrobats, which interested both Elayne and
Nynaeve, since they had spent some time with such a show. They talked of seamstresses, and the
varieties of lace available in Ebou Dar, and the different qualities of silk and linen that could be
bought, and Aviendha found herself responding with pleasure to comments on how well her gray silk
riding dress looked on her, and the other garments given to her by Tylin Quintara, fine woolens and
silks, and the stockings and shifts to go with them, and jewelry. Elayne and Nynaeve also had
received extravagant gifts. All together their presents filled a number of chests and bundles that had
been carried down to the stables by servants, along with their saddlebags.
“Why are you scowling, Aviendha?” Elayne asked, giving her a pat on the arm and a smile.
“Don’t worry. You know the weave; you will do just fine.”
Nynaeve leaned her head close and whispered, “I’ll fix you a tea when I have a chance. I know
several that will soothe your stomach. Or any woman’s troubles.” She patted Aviendha’s arm, too.
They did not understand. No comforting words or teas would cure what ailed her. She was
enjoying talk of lace and embroidery! She did not know whether to growl in disgust or wail in
despair. She was growing soft. Never before in her life had she looked at a woman’s dress except to

think where it might be hiding a weapon, never to notice the color and cut, or think how it would look
on her. It was past time to be away from this city, away from wetlander palaces. Soon she would start
simpering. She had not seen Elayne or Nynaeve do that, but everyone knew wetlander women
simpered, and it was obvious she had become as weak as any milk-water wetlander. Strolling armin-arm, chatting about lace! How was she to reach her belt knife if someone attacked them? A knife
might be useless against the likeliest assailants, but she had had faith in steel long before she knew
she could channel. Should anyone try to harm Elayne or Nynaeve—especially Elayne, but she had
promised Mat Cauthon to protect them both as surely as Birgitte and Aan’allein had—should anyone
try, she would plant steel in their hearts. Lace! As they walked, she wept inside at how soft she had
become.
Huge, paired stable doors fronted three sides of the palace’s largest stableyard, the doorways
crowded by servants in green-and-white livery. Behind them in the white stone stables waited horses,
saddled or loaded with wicker panniers. Seabirds wheeled and cried overhead, an unpleasant
reminder of how much water lay nearby. Heat shimmered up from pale paving stones, but it was
tension that thickened the air. Aviendha had seen blood spilled where there was less strain.
Renaile din Calon, in red and yellow silks, arms crossed arrogantly beneath her breasts, stood
before nineteen more barefoot women with tattooed hands and brightly colored blouses, most in
trousers and long sashes just as brilliant. Sweat glistening on dark faces did not lessen their grave
dignity. Some sniffed at lacy gold boxes, filled with heavy scent, that hung about their necks. Five fat
gold rings pierced each of Renaile din Calon’s ears, a chain from one dripping medallions as it ran
across her left cheek to a ring in her nose. The three women close behind her each wore eight earrings
and slightly fewer bits of dangling gold. That was how the Sea Folk marked rank among themselves,
with the women at least. All deferred to Renaile din Calon, Windfinder to the Mistress of the Ships to
the Atha’an Miere, but even the two apprentices at the rear, in dark trousers and linen blouses instead
of silk, added their own golden shimmers to the air. When Aviendha and the others appeared, Renaile
din Calon ostentatiously looked to the sun, past its noon peak. Her eyebrows climbed as she directed
her gaze back to them, eyes black as her white-winged hair, a demanding stare of impatience so loud
she might as well have shouted.
Elayne and Nynaeve stopped short, dragging Aviendha to an abrupt halt. They exchanged
worried glances past her, and deep sighs. She did not see how they were to escape. Obligation bound
her near-sister and Nynaeve hand and foot, and they themselves had tied the knots tight.
“I’ll see to the Knitting Circle,” Nynaeve muttered under her breath, and Elayne said, a little
more stoutly, “I’ll make sure the sisters are ready.”
Releasing her arms, they went in opposite directions, holding their skirts up to step quickly and
followed by Birgitte and Lan. That left her facing Renaile din Calon’s gaze alone, the eagle stare of a
woman who knew she held the high ground and could not be dislodged. Fortunately, the Windfinder to
the Mistress of the Ships quickly turned to her companions, so quickly that the ends of her long yellow
sash swung wide. The other Windfinders gathered around her, intent on her quiet words. Hitting her
even once would surely ruin everything. Aviendha tried not to glare at them, but as much she
attempted to look elsewhere, her eyes returned. No one had the right to catch her near-sister in a cleft
stick. Nose rings! A good grip on that chain, and Renaile din Calon Blue Star would wear a very
different expression.
Clustered together at one end of the stableyard, tiny Merilille Ceandevin and four more Aes
Sedai also regarded the Windfinders, most with annoyance ill-concealed behind cool serenity. Even
slender white-haired Vandene Namelle and her mirror-image first-sister Adeleas, who usually looked

the most imperturbable of them all. Now and then one or another adjusted a thin linen dust-cloak or
brushed at divided silk skirts. Sudden gusts did raise a little dust and stir the color-shifting cloaks of
the five Warders just at their backs, yet clearly annoyance moved their hands. Only Sareitha, standing
guard over a large white disc-shaped bundle, did not twitch, but she frowned. Merilille’s . . . maid . .
. Pol, scowled from behind them. The Aes Sedai heatedly disapproved of the bargain that had brought
the Atha’an Miere from their ships and given them a right to stare at Aes Sedai with demanding
impatience, but that bargain tied the sisters’ tongues and choked them on their own irritation. Which
they tried to hide; they might have succeeded with the wetlanders. The third group of women, in a
tight knot at the opposite end of the yard, earned almost as much of their study.
Reanne Corly and the other ten survivors of the Kin’s Knitting Circle stirred uneasily under that
disapproving scrutiny, dabbing their sweaty faces with embroidered handkerchiefs, adjusting their
broad, colorful straw hats, smoothing sober woolen skirts sewn up on one side to expose layers of
petticoats as bright as the Sea Folk’s garb. In part it was the stares of the Aes Sedai that had them
shifting from foot to foot; fear of the Forsaken and the gholam added to it, and so did other things. The
narrow, plunging necklines of those dresses should have been enough. Most of these women showed
at least a few lines on their cheeks, yet they looked like girls caught with their hands full of stolen
nutbread. All but stout Sumeko, fists planted on broad hips, who met the Aes Sedai stare for stare. A
bright glow of saidar surrounded one of their number, Kirstian, who kept glancing over her shoulder.
With a pale face perhaps ten years older than Nynaeve’s, she appeared out of place among the others.
That face grew whiter every time her black eyes met those of an Aes Sedai.
Nynaeve hurried to the women who led the Kin, her face beaming encouragement, and Reanne
and the others smiled with visible relief. Marred a little, true, by the sidelong glances they directed at
Lan; him they regarded as the wolf he resembled. Nynaeve, however, was the reason Sumeko did not
wilt like the rest whenever an Aes Sedai glanced in her direction. She had vowed to teach those
women that they possessed backbones, though Aviendha did not completely understand why. Nynaeve
was Aes Sedai herself; no Wise One would ever tell anyone to stand up to Wise Ones.
However well that might be working with respect to the other Aes Sedai, even Sumeko wore a
slightly fawning air for Nynaeve. The Knitting Circle found it strange, to say the least, that women as
young as Elayne and Nynaeve gave orders to the other Aes Sedai and were obeyed. Aviendha herself
found it peculiar; how could strength in the Power, something you were born with as surely as your
eyes, weigh more heavily than the honor that years could bring? Yet the older Aes Sedai did obey,
and for the Kinswomen, that was enough. Ieine, nearly as tall as Aviendha herself and almost as dark
as the Sea Folk, returned Nynaeve’s every glance with an obsequious smile, while Dimana, white
streaking her bright red hair, ducked her head constantly under Nynaeve’s eyes, and yellow-haired
Sibella hid nervous giggles behind a hand. Despite their Ebou Dari garments, only Tamarla, lean and
olive-skinned, was Altaran, and not even from the city.
They parted as soon as Nynaeve came close, revealing a woman on her knees, wrists bound
behind her, a leather sack covering her head, and her fine clothes torn and dusty. She was as much the
reason for their uneasiness as Merilille’s frowns or the Forsaken. Perhaps more.
Tamarla dragged the hood off, leaving the woman’s thin, bead-studded braids tangled; Ispan
Shefar tried to rise, and managed to reach an awkward crouch before she staggered and sank back
down, blinking and giggling foolishly. Sweat ran down her cheeks, and a few bruises from her
capture marred her ageless features. She had been treated too gently for her crimes, to Aviendha’s
mind.
The herbs Nynaeve had forced down the woman’s throat still fogged her wits as well as

weakening her knees, but Kirstian held a shield on her with every shred of the Power she could
summon. There was no chance the Shadowrunner might escape—even had she not been dosed,
Kirstian was as strong in the Power as Reanne, stronger than most Aes Sedai Aviendha had met—yet
even Sumeko plucked her skirts nervously and avoided looking at the kneeling woman.
“Surely the sisters should have her, now.” Reanne’s high-pitched voice carried, unsteady enough
to belong to the Black sister Kirstian shielded. “Nynaeve Sedai, we . . . we should not be guar—uh—
in charge of . . . an Aes Sedai.”
“That’s right,” Sumeko put in quickly. And anxiously. “The Aes Sedai should have her, now.”
Sibella echoed her, and nods and murmurs of agreement rippled through the Kinswomen. They
believed in their bones that they stood far below Aes Sedai; very likely they would have chosen
guarding Trollocs over holding an Aes Sedai.
The disapproving stares from Merilille and the other sisters changed once Ispan Shefar’s face
was revealed. Sareitha Tomares, who had worn her brown-fringed shawl only a few years and still
did not have the ageless appearance, glared with a disgust that should have flayed the Shadowrunner
at fifty paces. Adeleas and Vandene, hands tightening on their skirts, appeared to struggle with hatred
for the woman who had been their sister and betrayed them. Yet the stares they gave the Knitting
Circle were not that much better. They, too, knew in their hearts that the Kin stood a very long way
below them. There was much more to it than that, but the betrayer had been one of their own, and no
one but they had the right to her. Aviendha agreed. A Maiden who betrayed her spear-sisters did not
die quickly or un-shamed.
Nynaeve pulled the sack back down over Ispan Shefar’s head with some force. “You’ve done
well so far, and you’ll continue to do well,” she told the Kinswomen firmly. “If she shows signs of
coming round, pour some more of that mixture down her. It’ll keep her giddy as a goat full of ale.
Hold her nose, if she tries not to swallow. Even an Aes Sedai will swallow if you hold her nose and
threaten to box her ears.”
Reanne’s jaw dropped and her eyes sprang wide, like most of her companions’. Sumeko nodded,
but slowly, and goggled nearly as much as the others. When Kinswomen said Aes Sedai, they might
have been naming the Creator. The thought of holding an Aes Sedai’s nose, even a Shadowrunner’s,
painted their faces with horror.
By the popping eyes among the Aes Sedai, they liked the notion even less. Merilille opened her
mouth, staring at Nynaeve, but just then Elayne reached her, and the Gray sister rounded on her
instead, sparing barely a single disapproving frown for Birgitte. It was a measure of her agitation that
her voice rose rather than dropping; normally Merilille was very discreet. “Elayne, you must speak to
Nynaeve. Those women are confused and frightened out of their wits already. It won’t help if she
upsets them even more. If the Amyrlin Seat really does intend to allow them to go to the Tower,” she
shook her head slowly, trying to deny that, and perhaps a great deal else, “if she does mean to, they
must have a clear picture of their places, and—”
“The Amyrlin does,” Elayne cut her off. From Nynaeve, a firm tone was a fist shaken under your
nose; from Elayne, it was calm certainty. “They will have their chance to try again, and if they fail,
they still will not be sent away. No woman who can channel will be cut off from the Tower again.
They will all be a part of the White Tower.”
Fingering her belt knife idly, Aviendha wondered about that. Egwene, Elayne’s Amyrlin Seat,
said much the same. She was a friend, too, but she had wrapped her heart around being Aes Sedai.
Aviendha herself did not want to be part of the White Tower. She very much doubted that Sorilea or
any other Wise One did, either.

Merilille sighed and folded her hands, yet for all her outward acceptance, she still forgot to
lower her voice. “As you say, Elayne. But about Ispan. We simply cannot allow—”
Elayne raised a hand sharply. Command replaced mere certainty. “Cease, Merilille. You have
the Bowl of the Winds to watch. That is enough for anyone. It will be enough for you.”
Merilille opened her mouth, then closed it again and bowed her head slightly in acquiescence.
Under Elayne’s steady gaze, the other Aes Sedai bent theirs, too. If some displayed reluctance,
however small, not all did. Sareitha hurriedly picked up the disc-shaped bundle, wrapped in layers of
white silk, that had been lying by her feet. Her arms barely went all the way around as she held the
Bowl of the Winds to her bosom, smiling anxiously at Elayne as if to show that she really was
keeping a close eye on it.
The Sea Folk women stared hungrily at the bundle, almost leaning forward. Aviendha would not
have been surprised to see them leap across the stones to seize the Bowl. The Aes Sedai saw the
same, plainly. Sareitha clutched the white parcel more tightly, and Merilille actually stepped between
her and the Atha’an Miere. Smooth Aes Sedai faces tightened with the effort of remaining
expressionless. They believed the Bowl should belong to them; all things that used or manipulated the
One Power belonged to the White Tower in their eyes, no matter who happened to possess them at the
moment. But there was the bargain.
“The sun moves, Aes Sedai,” Renaile din Calon announced loudly, “and danger threatens. So
you maintain. If you think to worm free in some fashion by delaying, think twice and again. Try to
break the bargain, and by my father’s heart, I will return to the ships at once. And claim the Bowl for
redress. It was ours from the Breaking.”
“You watch your tongue with Aes Sedai,” Reanne barked, scandalized indignation from her blue
straw hat to the stout shoes peeking from beneath her green-and-white petticoats.
Renaile din Calon’s mouth curled into a sneer. “The jellyfish have tongues, it seems. A surprise
they can use them, though, when no Aes Sedai gave permission.”
In an instant the stableyard was full of shouted insults flying between Kin and Atha’an Miere,
“wilder” and “spineless” and growing worse, strident cries that buried Merilille’s attempts to hush
Reanne and her companions on one hand and soothe the Sea Folk on the other. Several Windfinders
stopped fingering the daggers thrust behind their sashes and gripped hilts instead. The glow of saidar
sprang up around first one then another of the brightly clad women. The Kinswomen looked startled,
though it did not slow their tirade, but Sumeko embraced the Source, then Tamarla, then willowy,
doe-eyed Chilares, and soon every one of them and every one of the Windfinders shone while words
flew and tempers boiled.
Aviendha wanted to groan. Any moment blood would begin to flow. She would follow Elayne’s
lead, but her near-sister was glaring cold fury at Windfinders and Knitting Circle alike. Elayne had
small patience with stupidity, in herself or others, and shouting insults when an enemy might be
coming was the worst sort. Aviendha took a firm grip on her belt knife, then after a moment embraced
saidar; life and joy filled her to near weeping. Wise Ones only used the Power when words had
failed, but neither words nor steel would do here. She wished she had some idea of who to kill first.
“Enough!” Nynaeve’s piercing shriek sliced the words short on every tongue. Astonished faces
swiveled toward her. Her head swung dangerously, and she stabbed a finger at the Knitting Circle.
“Stop behaving like children!” Although she had moderated her tone, it was by hairs. “Or do you
mean to squabble until the Forsaken come to scoop up the Bowl and us? And you,” that finger thrust
at the Windfinders, “stop trying to wriggle out of your agreement! You won’t get the Bowl until
you’ve met every last word! Don’t think you will!” Nynaeve swung round on the Aes Sedai. “And you

. . . !” Met by cool surprise, her flow of words tapered off into a sour grunt. The Aes Sedai had not
joined in the shouting except to try quieting it. None shone with the light of saidar.
That was not enough to calm Nynaeve completely, of course. She tugged fiercely at her hat,
plainly still full of anger she wanted to loose. But the Kinswomen were staring at the paving stones in
red-faced chagrin, and even the Windfinders appeared a little abashed—a little—muttering to
themselves yet refusing quite to meet Nynaeve’s glare. The glow winked out around one woman after
another, until only Aviendha still held to the Source.
She gave a start as Elayne touched her arm. She was getting soft. Letting people sneak up on her,
jumping at a touch.
“This crisis seems to be weathered,” Elayne murmured. “Perhaps it’s time to go before the next
breaks out.” A touch of color in her cheeks was the only sign that she had ever been angry. And a bit
in Birgitte’s; the two reflected one another in some ways since the bonding.
“Past time,” Aviendha agreed. Much longer, and she would be a milk-hearted wetlander.
Every eye followed as she walked out into the open space in the center of the stableyard, to the
spot she had studied and felt until she knew it with her eyelids closed. There was a joy in holding the
Power, a joy in working saidar, that she could not have put into words. To contain saidar, to be
contained by it, was to seem alive beyond any other time. A delusion, the Wise Ones said, as false
and dangerous as a mirage of water in the Termool, yet it seemed more real than the paving stones
beneath her feet. She fought the urge to draw more; already she held nearly as much as she could.
Everyone crowded close as she began to weave the flows.
That there were things many Aes Sedai could not do still startled Aviendha, after all she had
seen. Several of the Knitting Circle were strong enough, but only Sumeko and, surprisingly, Reanne
openly studied what she was doing. Sumeko went so far as to shrug off the encouraging pats Nynaeve
tried to give her—which earned a look of startled indignation from Nynaeve that Sumeko, her gaze
fixed on Aviendha, never saw. All of the Windfinders had sufficient strength. They watched as
hungrily as they had stared at the Bowl. The bargain gave them every right.
Aviendha focused, and the flows wove together, creating identity between this place and the
place she and Elayne and Nynaeve had chosen on a map. She gestured as though opening tentflaps.
That was no part of the weave Elayne had taught her, but it was almost all she could recall of what
she herself had done, long before Egwene made her first gateway. The flows coalesced into a silvery,
vertical slash that rotated and became an opening in the air, taller than a man and just as wide.
Beyond lay a large clearing surrounded by trees twenty or thirty feet high, miles north of the city, on
the far side of the river. Knee-high brown grass came right up to the gateway, swaying through in a
small breeze; it had not truly turned, only seemed to. Some of those blades were sliced cleanly,
though, some lengthwise. The edges of an opening gateway made a razor seem dull.
The gateway filled her with dissatisfaction. Elayne could make this weave with only a part of
her strength, yet for some reason it required all but a fraction of Aviendha’s. She was sure she could
have woven a larger, as large as Elayne could, using the weaves she had made without thought while
trying to escape Rand al’Thor what seemed a very long time ago, but no matter how often she tried,
only scraps came back to her. She felt no envy—rather, she took pride in her near-sister’s
accomplishments—but her own failure made shame surge in her heart. Sorilea or Amys would be
hard on her, if they knew that. About the shame. Too much pride, they would call it. Amys should
understand; she had been a Maiden. There was shame in failing at what you should be able to do. If
she had not had to hold the weave, she would have run away so no one could see her.
The departure had been carefully planned, and the whole stableyard sprang into motion as soon

as the gateway opened fully. Two of the Knitting Circle pulled the hooded Shadowrunner to her feet,
and the Windfinders hurriedly formed a line behind Renaile din Calon. The servants began bringing
horses out of the stables. Lan, Birgitte, and one of Careane’s Warders, a lanky man called Cieryl
Arjuna, immediately darted through the gateway, one behind the other. Like Far Dareis Mai, Warders
always claimed the right to scout ahead. Aviendha’s feet itched to run after them, but there was no
point. Unlike Elayne, she could not move more than five or six steps without this weave beginning to
weaken, and the same if she tried to tie it off. It was very frustrating.
This time there was no real expectation of danger, so the Aes Sedai followed immediately,
Elayne and Nynaeve as well. Farms dotted that treed area thickly, and a wandering shepherd or a
young couple seeking privacy might need guidance away from seeing too much, but no Shadowsouled
or Shadowrunner could know that clearing; only she, Elayne, and Nynaeve did, and they had not
spoken in the choosing, for fear of eavesdroppers. Standing in the opening, Elayne gave Aviendha a
questioning look, but Aviendha motioned her to go on. Plans were meant to be followed unless there
was reason to change them.
The Windfinders began filing slowly through to the clearing, each suddenly irresolute as she
approached this thing she had never dreamed of, taking a breath before she entered. And abruptly, the
prickling returned.
Aviendha’s eyes rose to the windows overlooking the stableyard. Anyone might be hidden
behind the white screens of intricate wrought iron and piercework carving. Tylin had ordered the
servants to stay away from those windows, but who would stop Teslyn, or Joline, or. . . . Something
made her look higher, to the domes and towers. Narrow walks ringed some of those slim spires, and
on one, very high, was a black shape haloed by a sharp nimbus from the sun behind. A man.
Her breath caught. Nothing in his stance, hands on the stone railing, spoke of danger, yet she
knew he was the one who put that crawling between her shoulder blades. One of the Shadowsouled
would not stand there simply watching, but that creature, that gholam. . . . Ice formed in her belly. He
could be just a palace servant. He could be, but she did not believe it. No shame in knowing fear.
Anxiously she glanced at the women still edging through the gateway with agonizing slowness.
Half the Sea Folk were gone, and the Knitting Circle waited behind the rest with the Shadowrunner
firmly in hand, their own unease at the passage warring with resentment that the Sea Folk women
were allowed to go first. If she voiced her suspicions, the Kinswomen surely would run—mere
mention of the Shadowsouled dried their mouths and turned their bowels to water—while the
Windfinders might well try to claim the Bowl straightaway. With them, the Bowl stood above
anything else. But only a blind fool stood scratching herself while a lion crept up on the herd she had
been set to guard. She caught one of the Atha’an Miere by a red silk sleeve.
“Tell Elayne—” A face like smooth black stone turned to her; the woman somehow made full
lips seem thin; her eyes were black pebbles, flat and hard. What message could she send that would
not bring down all the troubles she feared from them? “Tell Elayne and Nynaeve to be wary. Tell
them enemies always come when you least want them. You must say this to her, without fail.” The
Windfinder nodded with barely concealed impatience, but surprisingly, she waited for Aviendha to
release her before making her hesitant way through the gateway.
The walk up on the tower stood empty. Aviendha felt no relief. He could be anywhere. Making
his way down to the stableyard. Whoever he was, whatever he was, he was dangerous; this was not a
dust-funnel dancing in her imagination. The last four Warders had formed a square around the
gateway, a guard who would be last to leave, and much as she despised their swords, she was
grateful that someone there besides herself knew the use of sharp metal. Not that they would have any

more chance against a gholam, or worse, one of the Shadowsouled, than the servants waiting with the
horses. Or than she herself.
Grimly she drew the Power, until the sweetness of saidar grew near to pain. A hair beyond, and
pain would almost become blinding agony for the moments needed to die or lose the ability
completely. Would those shuffling women quicken their feet! No shame in feeling fear, but she was
very much afraid that hers was painted on her face.

CHAPTER
2

Unweaving

E layne stepped to one side as soon as she was through the gateway, but Nynaeve trampled
across the clearing, kicking up brown grasshoppers from the dead grass and peering this way
and that for evidence of the Warders. Of one Warder, anyway. A bright red bird flashed across
the clearing and was gone. Nothing else moved except the sisters; a squirrel barked somewhere
in the mostly leafless trees, and then there was silence. To Elayne it seemed impossible those
three could have passed this way without leaving paths as wide as that behind Nynaeve, yet she
could not make out any sign that they had been there at all.
She sensed Birgitte somewhere off to her left, roughly southwest she thought, and feeling quite
content, clearly in no immediate danger. Careane, part of a protective circle gathered around Sareitha
and the Bowl, cocked her head almost as if listening. Apparently her Cieryl was to the southeast.
Which meant Lan was north. Oddly enough, north was the direction Nynaeve had settled down to
watch, all the while muttering under her breath. Perhaps being married had created some sense of him
in her. More likely, she had noticed a track that escaped Elayne. Nynaeve was as skilled at
woodscraft as she was with herbs.
From where Elayne stood at first, Aviendha was clearly visible through the gateway, studying
the palace rooftops as if she expected an ambush. By her stance, she could have been carrying spears,
ready to leap into battle in her riding dress. She made Elayne smile, hiding how distressed she was
about her problems with the gateway, so much braver than she herself. But at the same time she could
not help worrying. Aviendha was brave, and no one Elayne knew was better able to keep her head.
She also might decide that ji’e’toh required her to fight when there was no chance except in running.
The light around her shone so brightly it was obvious she could not draw much more of saidar. If one
of the Forsaken did appear. . . .
I should have stayed with her. Elayne rejected the thought immediately. Whatever excuse she
gave, Aviendha would know the truth, and she was touchy as a man, sometimes. Most of the time.
Especially when it bore upon her honor. With a sigh, Elayne let the Atha’an Miere crowd her farther
from the gateway as they filed through. She stayed close enough to hear any shout on the other side,
though. Close enough to leap to Aviendha’s aid in a heartbeat. And for another reason.

The Windfinders came through in order of rank, striving to keep their faces smooth, but even
Renaile relaxed tight shoulders once her bare feet were beating down the tall brown grass. Some
gave a little shiver, quickly suppressed, or glanced back with round eyes at the opening hanging in
midair. One and all, they stared at Elayne suspiciously as they stepped by her, and two or three
opened their mouths, perhaps to ask what she was doing, perhaps to ask—or tell—her to move. She
was just as glad that they hurried on in obedience to Renaile’s curt urgings. They would have their
chance to tell Aes Sedai what to do soon enough; it did not have to start with her.
That thought made her stomach sink, and the number of them made her shake her head. They had
the knowledge of weather to use the Bowl properly, yet even Renaile agreed—if reluctantly—that the
more Power directed through the Bowl, the better the chances of being able to heal the weather. It
must be directed with a precision impossible except for one woman alone or a circle, though. A full
circle of thirteen it had to be. That thirteen certainly would include Nynaeve and Aviendha and
Elayne herself, and probably a few of the Kin, but Renaile plainly intended to jump on the part of the
bargain that said they would be allowed to learn any abilities the Aes Sedai could teach. The gateway
had been the first, and forming a circle would be the second. A wonder she had not brought every
Windfinder in the harbor. Imagine trying to deal with three or four hundred of these women! Elayne
offered a small prayer of thanks that there were only twenty.
She was not standing there to count them, though. As each Windfinder passed, barely more than a
pace away, she let herself feel the woman’s strength in the Power. Earlier there had been time to get
close enough to only a handful, what with all the trouble of convincing Renaile to come at all.
Apparently achieving rank among the Windfinders had nothing to do with either age or strength;
Renaile was far from the strongest even in the first three or four, while one woman toward the rear,
Senine, had weathered cheeks and thickly grayed hair. Strangely, by the marks in her ears it seemed
that Senine might once have worn more than six earrings, and thicker ones than she did now.
Elayne sorted and stored away faces and the names she knew with a growing sense of
complacency. The Windfinders might have secured an upper hand of sorts, and she and Nynaeve
might be in deep trouble, very deep, with both Egwene and the Hall of the Tower once the terms of
their bargain became known, but none of these women would stand particularly high among Aes
Sedai. Certainly not low, but not high. She told herself not to feel smug—it changed nothing in what
they had agreed—yet it was very hard not to. These were the best the Atha’an could produce, after
all. Here in Ebou Dar, anyway. And if they had been Aes Sedai, every one of them, from Kurin, with
her stony black stare, to Renaile herself, would have listened when she spoke and stood when she
entered a room. If they were Aes Sedai and behaving as they should.
And then the end of the line appeared, and she gave a start as a young Windfinder off one of the
smaller ships passed her, a round-cheeked woman called Rainyn, in plain blue silks, with barely a
half-dozen ornaments hanging from her nose chain. The two apprentices, boyishly slim Talaan and
big-eyed Metarra, scurried at the very tail with harried expressions. They had not earned the nose
ring yet, much less the chain, and only a single thin gold earring in the left ear balanced the three in
the right. Her eyes followed the three of them just short of staring. Perhaps not short of it, at that.
The Atha’an Miere clustered with Renaile again, most, like her, glaring hungrily at the Aes
Sedai and the Bowl. The last three women stood at the rear, the apprentices with the air of those
uncertain whether they had a right to be there at all, Rainyn folding her arms in imitation of Renaile,
yet doing little better than the other two. The Windfinder on a darter, the least of the Sea Folk vessels,
likely seldom found herself in company with the Windfinder to her clan Wavemistress, not to mention
the Windfinder to the Mistress of the Ships. Rainyn was easily as strong as Lelaine or Romanda, and

Metarra on a level with Elayne herself, while Talaan. . . . Talaan, so meek in her red linen blouse,
with eyes that seemed permanently downcast, came very close to Nynaeve. Very close. More, Elayne
knew she herself had not yet reached her full potential, and neither had Nynaeve. How close were
Metarra and Talaan? She had grown accustomed to knowing that only Nynaeve and the Forsaken
were stronger than she. Well, Egwene, but she had been forced, and her own potential, and
Aviendha’s, matched Egwene’s. So much for complacency, she told herself ruefully. Lini would have
said it was what she deserved for taking things for granted.
Laughing softly at herself, Elayne turned back to check on Aviendha, but the Knitting Circle
stood rooted to one spot in front of the gateway, twitching at cold stares from Careane and Sareitha.
All but Sumeko, and she did not move away either for all that she had met the sisters’ gazes. Kirstian
appeared ready to burst into tears.
Suppressing a sigh, Elayne herded the Kinswomen out of the way of the stable folk waiting to
bring the horses through. The Knitting Circle went along like sheep—she was the shepherd, Merilille
and the rest the wolves—and they would have moved faster if not for Ispan.
Famelle, one of only four among the Knitting Circle without a touch of gray or white in her hair,
and Eldase, a fierce-eyed woman when she was not looking at an Aes Sedai, held Ispan by the arms.
They could not seem to decide between holding her firmly enough to keep her upright and not
clutching her too tightly, with the result that the Black sister moved in a bobbing fashion, sagging
halfway to her knees when they loosened their grips, then pulled back up just before she fell
completely.
“Forgive me, Aes Sedai,” Famelle kept murmuring to Ispan with a faint Taraboner accent. “Oh, I
am sorry, Aes Sedai.” Eldase winced and gave a little moan every time Ispan stumbled. Just as if
Ispan had not helped murder two of their number and the Light alone knew how many others. They
were fussing over a woman who was going to die. The killings in the White Tower that Ispan had
conspired at were enough to condemn her by themselves.
“Take her over there somewhere,” Elayne told them, waving away from the gateway into the
clearing. They obeyed, bobbing curtsies and nearly dropping Ispan, murmuring apologies to Elayne
and to the hooded prisoner. Reanne and the rest scurried along, anxiously eyeing the sisters around
Merilille.
Almost immediately the war of glares started up again, the Aes Sedai at the Kinswomen, the
Knitting Circle at the Windfinders, and the Atha’an Miere at anybody their eyes fell on. Elayne
clamped her teeth shut. She was not going to shout at them. Nynaeve always got better results with
yells, anyway. But she did want to shake some sense into every one of them, shake them until their
teeth rattled. Including Nynaeve, who was supposed to be getting everyone organized instead of
staring into the trees. But what if it had been Rand who was going to die unless she could find a way
to save him?
Suddenly tears trembled on the edge of falling, stinging her eyes. Rand was going to die, and
there was nothing she could do to stop it. Peel the apple in your hand, girl, not the one on the tree,
Lini’s thin voice seemed to whisper in her ear. Tears are for after; they just waste time before.
“Thank you, Lini,” Elayne murmured. Her old nurse was an irritating woman sometimes, never
admitting that any of her charges had really grown up, but her advice was always good. Just because
Nynaeve was slacking her duties was no reason for Elayne to slack hers.
Servants had started trotting horses through right on the heels of the Knitting Circle, beginning
with the packhorses. None of those first animals carried anything so frivolous as clothes. They could
walk if the riding horses needed to be abandoned on the other side of the gateway, and wear what

they stood up in if the rest of the pack animals had to be left behind, but what was on those first horses
could not be left for the Forsaken. Elayne motioned the leather-cheeked woman leading the very first
to follow her aside, out of the way of the others.
Untying and tossing back the stiff canvas cover on one of the wide wicker panniers revealed a
great heap of what appeared to be rubbish stuffed in every which way, right up to the top, some of it
wrapped in cloth that was falling to pieces. The greater part of it probably was rubbish. Embracing
saidar, Elayne began sorting. A rusted breastplate quickly went onto the ground, along with a broken
table leg, a cracked platter, a badly dented pewter pitcher, and a bolt of rotted, unidentifiable cloth
that almost broke apart in her hands.
The storeroom where they found the Bowl of the Winds had been stuffed full, things that should
have been on a refuse heap jumbled in with more objects of the Power than just the Bowl, some in
beetle-riddled casks or chests, some carelessly stacked. For hundreds and hundreds of years the Kin
had hidden away all things they found that were connected to the Power, fearful of using them and
fearful of delivering them to Aes Sedai. Until that very morning. This was the first chance Elayne had
had to see what was worth keeping. The Light send that the Darkfriends had not gotten away with
anything important; they had taken some, but certainly less than a quarter of what the room had held,
rubbish included. The Light send she found something they could use. People had died to bring these
things out of the Rahad.
She did not channel, just held the Power as she lifted each item. A chipped clay cup, three
broken plates, a child’s moth-eaten dress, and an old boot with a hole worn through the side all fell to
the ground. A stone carving a little larger than her hand—it felt like stone; it might have been a
carving, though it did not exactly look carved, for some reason—all deep blue curves vaguely like
roots. It seemed to warm faintly at her touch; it held a . . . resonance . . . to saidar. That was the
closest word she could think of. What it was meant to do, she had no idea, but it was a ter’angreal
without any doubt. It went on the other side of her, away from the pile of rubbish.
The heap of refuse continued to grow, but so did the other, if more slowly, things that had
nothing in common except the faint warmth and the sense of echoing the Power. A small box that felt
like ivory, covered in wavering red and green stripes; she set it down carefully without opening the
hinged lid. You could never tell what might trigger a ter’angreal. A black rod no thicker than her
little finger, a pace in length, stiff yet so flexible she thought she could have doubled it into a circle. A
tiny stoppered vial that might have been crystal, with a dark red liquid inside. The figure of a stout,
bearded man with a jolly smile, holding a book; two feet tall, it appeared to be age-darkened bronze
and took both of her hands to move. Other things. Most was trash, though. And none was what she
truly wanted. Not yet.
“Is this the time to be doing that?” Nynaeve asked. She straightened hastily from the small cluster
o f ter’angreal, grimacing and rubbing her hand on her skirt. “That rod feels like . . . pain,” she
muttered. The hard-faced woman holding the packhorse’s head blinked at the rod and edged away.
Elayne eyed the rod—Nynaeve’s occasional impressions about objects she touched could be
useful—but she did not stop sorting. There had been too much pain lately to need any more, surely.
Not that what Nynaeve sensed was always that straightforward. The rod might have been present
when a great deal of pain was caused without being the cause in itself. The pannier was almost
empty; some of what was on the other side of the horse would have to be shifted to balance the
weight. “If there’s an angreal in this somewhere, Nynaeve, I would like to find it before Moghedien
taps one of us on the shoulder.”
Nynaeve grunted sourly, but she peered into the wicker basket.

Dropping another table leg—that made three, none of which matched—Elayne spared a glance
for the clearing. All of the packhorses were out, and the mounts were coming through the gateway,
now, filling the open space between the trees with bustle and confusion. Merilille and the other Aes
Sedai already sat their saddles, barely concealing their impatience to be off, while Pol fussed
hurriedly with her mistress’s saddlebags, but the Windfinders.
Graceful afoot, graceful on their ships, they were unused to horses. Renaile was trying to mount
from the wrong side, and the gentle bay mare chosen for her danced slow circles around the liveried
man who was gripping the bridle with one hand while tugging his hair in frustration with the other and
vainly trying to correct the Windfinder. Two of the stablewomen were attempting to hoist Dorile, who
served the Wavemistress of Clan Somarin, into her saddle, while a third, holding the gray’s head,
wore the tight face of someone trying not to laugh. Rainyn was on the back of a leggy brown gelding,
but somehow without either foot in the stirrups or the reins in her hands and having considerable
trouble finding any of them. And those three seemed to be having the easiest time of it. Horses
whinnied and danced and rolled their eyes, and Windfinders shouted curses in voices that could have
been heard over a gale. One of them knocked a serving man flat with her fist, and three more stable
folk were trying to catch mounts that had gotten free.
There was also what she had expected to see, if Nynaeve was no longer keeping her private
watch. Lan stood by his black warhorse, Mandarb, dividing his gaze between the treeline, the
gateway, and Nynaeve. Birgitte came striding out of the woods shaking her head, and a moment later,
Cieryl, trotted from the trees, but with no sense of urgency. There was nothing out there to threaten or
inconvenience them.
Nynaeve was watching her, eyebrows raised high.
“I didn’t say anything,” Elayne said. Her hand closed on something small, wrapped in rotting
cloth that might have been white once. Or brown. She knew immediately what was inside.
“A good thing for you,” Nynaeve grumbled, not quite far enough under her breath. “I can’t abide
women who poke their noses into other people’s business.” Elayne let it pass without so much as a
start; she was proud that she did not have to bite her tongue.
Stripping away the decayed cloth revealed a small amber brooch in the shape of a turtle. It
looked like amber, anyway, and it might have been amber once, but when she opened herself to the
Source through it, saidar rushed into her, a torrent compared to what she could draw safely on her
own. Not a strong angreal, but far better than nothing. With it, she could handle twice as much of the
Power as Nynaeve, and Nynaeve herself would do better still. Releasing the extra flow ofsaidar, she
slipped the brooch into her belt pouch with a smile of delight and went back to searching. Where
there was one, there might be more. And now that she had one to study, she might be able to reason
out how to make an angreal. That was something she had wished for. It was all she could do not to
take the brooch out again and begin probing it right there.
Vandene had been eyeing Nynaeve and her for some time, and now she heeled her slab-sided
gelding over to them and dismounted. The groom at the packhorse’s head managed a decent if
awkward curtsy, more than she had for Elayne or Nynaeve. “You’re being careful,” Vandene said to
Elayne, “and that’s very good. But it might be better to leave these things alone until they’re in the
Tower.”
Elayne’s mouth tightened. In the Tower? Until they could be examined by someone else, was
what she meant. Someone older and supposedly more experienced. “I do know what I’m doing,
Vandene. I have made ter’angreal, after all. Nobody else living has done that.” She had taught the
basics to some sisters, but no one had managed the trick of it by the time she left for Ebou Dar.

The older Green nodded, flipping her reins idly against the palm of her riding glove. “Martine
Janata also knew what she was doing, so I understand,” she said casually. “She was the last sister to
really make a business of studying ter’angreal. She did it for over forty years, almost from the time
she reached the shawl. She was careful, too, so I was told. Then one day, Martine’s maid found her
unconscious on the floor of her sitting room. Burned out.” Even in a conversational tone, those words
were a sharp slap. Vandene’s voice did not alter a hair, though. “Her Warder was dead from the
shock. Not unusual in cases like that. When Martine came to, three days later, she couldn’t recall what
she had been working with. She couldn’t remember the preceding week at all. That was more than
twenty-five years ago, and no one since has had the nerve to touch any of the ter’angreal that were in
her rooms. Her notes mentioned every last one, and everything she had discovered was innocuous,
innocent, even frivolous, but. . . .” Vandene shrugged. “She found something she wasn’t expecting.”
Elayne peeked at Birgitte, and found Birgitte looking back at her. She did not need to see the
worried frown on the other woman’s face; it was mirrored in her mind, in the small patch of her mind
that was Birgitte and in the rest. Birgitte felt her worry, and she felt Birgitte’s, until sometimes it was
hard to say which was which. She risked more than herself. But she did know what she was doing.
More than anyone else there, at least. And even if none of the Forsaken appeared, they needed all the
angreal she could find.
“What happened to Martine?” Nynaeve asked quietly. “Afterward, I mean.” She could seldom
hear of anyone being hurt without wanting to Heal them; she wanted to Heal everything.
Vandene grimaced. She might have been the one to bring up Martine, but Aes Sedai did not like
talking about women who had been burned out or stilled. They did not like remembering them. “She
vanished once she was well enough to slip out of the Tower,” she said hurriedly. “The important
thing to remember is that she was cautious. I never met her, but I’ve been told she treated every
ter’angreal as if she had no idea what it might do next, even the one that makes the cloth for Warders’
cloaks, and nobody has ever been able to make that do anything else. She was careful, and it did her
no good.”
Nynaeve laid an arm across the nearly empty pannier. “Maybe you really should,” she began.
“No-o-o-o!” Merilille shrieked.
Elayne spun, instinctively opening herself through the angreal again, only half conscious of
saidar flooding into Nynaeve and Vandene. The glow of the Power sprang up around every woman in
the clearing who could embrace the Source. Merilille was straining forward in her saddle, eyes
bulging, one hand reaching toward the gateway. Elayne frowned. There was nothing there except
Aviendha, and the last four Warders, startled in the middle of walking away, searching for the threat
with swords half-drawn. Then she realized what Aviendha was doing and nearly lost saidar in her
shock.
The gateway trembled as Aviendha carefully picked apart the weave that had made it. It
shivered and flexed, the edges wavering. The last flows came loose, and instead of winking out, the
opening shimmered, the view through it of the courtyard fading away until it evaporated like mist in
the sun.
“That is impossible!” Renaile said incredulously. An astonished murmur of agreement broke out
among the Windfinders. The Kinswomen gaped at Aviendha, mouths working soundlessly.
Elayne nodded slowly in spite of herself. Clearly it was possible, but one of the first things she
had been told as a novice was that never, ever, under any circumstances was she to try what
Aviendha had just done. Picking apart a weave, any weave, rather than simply letting it dissipate,
could not be done, she had been told, not without inevitable disaster. Inevitable.

“You fool girl!” Vandene snapped, her face a thunderhead. She strode toward Aviendha
dragging her gelding behind. “Do you realize what you almost did? One slip—one!—and there’s no
saying what the weave will snap into, or what it will do! You could have completely destroyed
everything for a hundred paces! Five hundred! Everything! You could have burned yourself out and
—”
“It was necessary,” Aviendha cut in. A babble erupted from the mounted Aes Sedai crowding
around her and Vandene, but she glared at them and raised her voice over theirs. “I know the dangers,
Vandene Namelle, but it was necessary. Is this another thing you Aes Sedai cannot do? The Wise
Ones say any woman can learn, if she is taught, some women more and some less, but any woman, if
she can pick out embroidery.” She did not quite sneer. Not quite.
“This is not embroidery, girl!” Merilille’s voice was deep winter ice. “Whatever so-called
training you received among your people, you cannot possibly know what you are playing with! You
will promise me—swear to me!—that you will never do this again!”
“Her name should be in the novice book,” Sareitha said firmly, glaring across the Bowl still
held firmly to her bosom. “I’ve always said it. She should be entered in the book.” Careane nodded,
her stern gaze measuring Aviendha for a novice dress.
“That might not be necessary for the moment,” Adeleas told Aviendha, leaning forward in her
saddle, “but you must let yourself be guided by us.” The Brown sister’s tone was much milder than
the others’, yet she was not making a suggestion.
A month or so earlier, Aviendha might have begun to wilt under all that Aes Sedai disapproval,
but not now. Elayne hurriedly pushed in among the horses before her friend decided to draw the knife
she was fondling. Or to do something worse. “Maybe somebody should ask why she thought it was
necessary,” she said, slipping an arm around Aviendha’s shoulders as much to keep her arms at her
sides as for comfort.
Aviendha did not quite include her in the exasperated look she gave the other sisters. “This
leaves no residue,” she said patiently. Too patiently. “The residues of a weave this large might be
read two days from now.”
Merilille snorted, a very strong sound to come from that slight body. “That is a rare Talent, girl.
Neither Teslyn nor Joline has it. Or do you Aiel wilders all learn that as well?”
“Few can do it,” Aviendha admitted calmly. “But I can.” That produced a different sort of stare,
from Elayne as well; it was a very rare Talent. She did not seem to notice. “Do you claim that none of
the Shadowsouled can?” she went on. The tightness of her shoulder under Elayne’s hand said she was
not so cool as she pretended. “Are you such fools that you leave tracks for your enemies to follow?
Any who could read the residues could make a gateway to this spot.”
That would have taken great dexterity, very great dexterity, but the suggestion was enough to
leave Merilille blinking. Adeleas opened her mouth, then closed it without speaking, and Vandene
frowned thoughtfully. Sareitha simply looked worried. Who could say what Talents the Forsaken had,
what skill?
Strangely, all the fierceness drained out of Aviendha. Her eyes fell, her shoulders loosened.
“Perhaps I should not have taken the risk,” she muttered. “With that man watching me, I could not
think clearly, and when he disappeared. . . .” A little of her spirit returned, but not a great deal. “I do
not think a man could read my weaves,” she said to Elayne, “but if he was one of the Shadowsouled,
or even the gholam. . . . The Shadowsouled know more than any of us. If I was wrong, I have great
toh. But I do not think I was. I do not think it.”
“What man?” Nynaeve demanded. Her hat had been knocked askew in pushing among the horses,

and that, with the tight frown she directed at everyone impartially, made her look ready for a fight.
Perhaps she was. Careane’s gelding accidentally nudged her with a shoulder, and she swatted the
blue dun’s nose.
“A servant,” Merilille said dismissively. “Whatever orders Tylin gave, Altaran servants are an
independent lot. Or perhaps her son; that boy is too curious by half.”
The sisters around her nodded, and Careane said, “One of the Forsaken would hardly have stood
and watched. You said so yourself.” She was patting her gelding’s neck and frowning accusingly at
Nynaeve—Careane was one of those who gave her horse the sort of affection most people reserved
for infants—she was frowning at Nynaeve, and Nynaeve took the words for her, too.
“Maybe it was a servant, and maybe it was Beslan. Maybe.” Nynaeve’s sniff said she did not
believe it. Or that she wanted them to believe she did not; she could tell you to your face that you
were a blind idiot, yet let anyone else say it, and she would defend you until she went hoarse. Of
course, she did not seem ready to decide whether she liked Aviendha, but she definitely did not like
the older Aes Sedai. She tugged her hat almost straight, and her frown swept across them, then started
over. “Whether it was Beslan or the Dark One, there’s no call to stand here all day. We need to get
ready and move on to the farm. Well? Move!” She clapped her hands sharply, and even Vandene gave
a little start.
There was little preparation left to do when the sisters moved their horses away. Lan and the
other Warders had not sat on their heels once they realized there was no danger. Some of the servants
had gone back through the gateway before Aviendha disposed of it, but the rest stood with the three
dozen or so packhorses, occasionally glancing at the Aes Sedai, clearly wondering what marvel they
might produce next. The Windfinders were all mounted, if awkwardly, and holding their reins as
though expecting their horses to bolt any moment, or perhaps sprout wings and take flight. So were the
Knitting Circle, with a good deal more grace, unconcerned that their skirts and petticoats were pushed
up past their knees, and with Ispan still hooded and tied across a saddle like a sack. She could not
possibly have sat upright on a horse, yet even Sumeko’s eyes popped whenever they touched her.
Glaring about her, Nynaeve looked ready to tongue-lash everybody into doing what they had
already done, but only until Lan handed her the reins of her plump brown mare. She had adamantly
refused the gift of a better horse from Tylin. Her hand trembled a little when it touched Lan’s, and her
face changed color as she swallowed the anger she had been about to unleash. When he offered a
hand for her foot, she stared at him for a moment as if wondering what he was about, then colored
again when he boosted her to her saddle. Elayne could only shake her head. She hoped she did not
turn into an idiot when she married. If she married.
Birgitte brought her silvery-gray mare and the yellow dun Aviendha rode, but she seemed to
understand that Elayne wanted a private word with Aviendha. She nodded almost as if Elayne had
spoken, swung up onto her mouse-colored gelding, and rode to where the other Warders were
waiting. They greeted her with nods and began discussing something in low voices. By the glances
directed at the sisters, the “something” had to do with taking care of Aes Sedai whether Aes Sedai
wanted care taken or not. Including herself, Elayne noted grimly. There was no time now for that,
though. Aviendha stood fiddling with her horse’s reins, staring at the animal like a novice staring at a
kitchen full of greasy pots. Very likely, Aviendha saw small difference between having to scrub pots
and having to ride.
Snugging her green riding gloves, Elayne casually shifted Lioness to block them from the others’
view, then touched Aviendha’s arm. “Talking to Adeleas or Vandene might help,” she said gently.
She had to be very careful here, as careful as with any ter’angreal. “They’re old enough to know

more than you might suspect. There has to be a reason you’ve been . . . having trouble . . . with
Traveling.” That was a mild way of putting it. Aviendha almost had failed to make the weave work at
all, in the beginning. Careful. Aviendha was far more important than any ter’angreal ever could be.
“They might be able to help.”
“How can they?” Aviendha stared stiffly at the saddle on her gelding. “They cannot Travel. How
could any of them know how to help?” Abruptly her shoulders slumped, and she turned her head to
Elayne. Shockingly, unshed tears glistened in her green eyes. “That isn’t the truth, Elayne. Not the
whole truth. They cannot help, but. . . . You are my near-sister; you have the right to know. They think
I panicked at a servant. If I ask for help, it must all come out. That I Traveled once to run from a man,
a man I hoped in my soul would catch me. To run like a rabbit. To run, wanting to be caught. How
could I let them know such shame? Even if they really could help, how could I?”
Elayne wished she did not know. About the catching part, at least. About the fact that Rand had
caught her. Snatching the flecks of jealousy that suddenly were floating through her, she pushed them
into a sack and stuffed it into the back of her head. Then she jumped up and down on it for good
measure. When a woman plays the fool, look for the man. That was one of Lini’s favorites. Another
was, Kittens tangle your yarn, men tangle your wits, and it’s simple as breathing for both . She
drew a deep breath. “No one will know from me, Aviendha. I’ll help you as much as I can. If I can
figure out how.” Not that there was much she could think to do. Aviendha was remarkably quick at
seeing how weaves were formed, much quicker than she herself.
Aviendha merely nodded and scrambled clumsily into her saddle, showing a bit more grace than
the Sea Folk. “There was a man watching, Elayne, and he was no servant.” Looking Elayne right in
the eye, she added, “He frightened me.” An admission she likely would have made to no one else in
the world.
“We’re safe from him now, whoever he was,” Elayne said, turning Lioness to follow Nynaeve
and Lan from the clearing. In truth, it very likely had been a servant, but she would never tell that to
anyone, Aviendha least of all. “We’re safe, and in a few more hours, we will reach the Kin’s farm,
we’ll use the Bowl, and the world will be right again.” Well, somewhat. The sun seemed lower than
it had in the stableyard, but she knew that was only imagination. For once, they had gained a clear
jump on the Shadow.
From behind a screen of white wrought iron, Moridin watched the last of the horses vanish
through the gateway, and then the tall young woman and the four Warders. It was possible they were
carrying away some item he could use—an angreal attuned to men, perhaps—but the chances were
small. For the rest, the ter’angreal, the greatest likelihood was that they would kill themselves trying
to puzzle out how to use them. Sammael was a fool to have risked so much to seize a collection of no
one knew what. But then, Sammael had never been half as clever as he thought. He himself would not
disrupt his own plans merely on the off chance, to see what scraps of civilization he could find. Only
idle curiosity had brought him here. He liked to know what others thought important. But it was dross.
He was about to turn away when the outlines of the gateway suddenly began to flex and tremble.
Transfixed, he watched until the opening simply—melted. He had never been a man to give way to
obscenities, but several rose in his mind. What had the woman done? These barbarous rustics offered
too many surprises. A way to Heal being severed, however imperfectly. That was impossible! Except
that they had done it. Involuntary rings. Those Warders and the bond they shared with their Aes Sedai.
He had known of that for a long, long time, but whenever he thought he had the measure of them, these
primitives revealed some new skill, did something that no one in his own Age had dreamed of.
Something the pinnacle of civilization had not known! What had the girl done?

“Great Master?”
Moridin barely turned his head from the window. “Yes, Madic?” Her soul be damned, what had
the girl done?
The balding man in green-and-white who had slipped into the small room bowed deeply before
falling to his knees. One of the upper servants in the palace, Madic, with his long face, possessed a
pompous dignity that he tried to maintain even now. Moridin had seen men who stood far higher do
far worse. “Great Master, I have learned what the Aes Sedai brought to the palace this morning. It is
said they found a great treasure hidden in ancient days, gold and jewels and heartstone, artifacts from
Shiota and Eharon and even the Age of Legends. There are said to be things among them that use the
One Power. It is said that one can control the weather. No one knows where they are going, Great
Master. The palace is aquiver with talk, but ten tongues name ten different destinations.”
Moridin went back to studying the stableyard below as soon as Madic spoke. Ridiculous tales of
gold and cuendillar held no interest. Nothing would make a gateway behave that way. Unless. . . .
Could she actually have unraveled the web? Death held no fear for him. Coldly he considered the
possibility that he had been within sight of an unraveling web. One that had been unmade
successfully. Another impossibility casually offered up by these . . .
Something Madic had said caught his ear. “The weather, Madic?” The shadows of the palace
spires had barely lengthened from their bases, but there was not a cloud to shield the baking city.
“Yes, Great Master. It is called the Bowl of the Winds.”
The name meant nothing to him. But . . . a ter’angreal to control the weather. . . . In his own Age,
weather had been carefully regulated with the use of ter’angreal. One of the surprises of this Age—
one of the smaller, it had seemed—was that there were those who could manipulate weather to a
degree that should have required one of those ter’angreal. One such device should not be enough to
affect even a large part of a single continent. But what could these women do with it? What? If they
used a ring?
He seized the True. Power without thought, the saa billowing black across his sight. His fingers
tightened in the wrought-iron grille across the window; the metal groaned, twisting, not from his grip
but from the tendrils of the True Power, drawn from the Great Lord himself, that wreathed around the
grillework, flexing as he flexed his hand in anger. The Great Lord would not be pleased. He had
strained from his prison to touch the world enough to fix the seasons in place. He was impatient to
touch the world more, to shatter the void that contained him, and he would not be pleased. Rage
enveloped Moridin, blood pounding in his ears. A moment past, he had not cared where those women
went, but now. . . . Somewhere far from here. People fleeing ran as far and as fast as they could.
Somewhere they felt safe. No use sending Madic to ask questions, no use squeezing anyone here; they
would not have been fool enough to leave anyone behind alive who knew their destination. Not to Tar
Valon. To al’Thor? To that band of rebel Aes Sedai? In all three places he had eyes, some that did
not know they served him. All would serve him, before the end. He would not allow chance slips to
spoil his plans now.
Abruptly he heard something other than the thundering drumbeat of his own fury. A bubbling
sound. He looked at Madic curiously, and stepped back from the spreading puddle on the floor. It
seemed that in his anger he had seized at more than the wrought-iron screen with the True Power.
Remarkable how much blood could be squeezed from a human body.
He let what remained of the man fall without regret; indeed, thinking only that when Madic was
found, the Aes Sedai would surely be blamed. A small addition to the chaos growing in the world.
Ripping a hole in the fabric of the Pattern, he Traveled with the True Power. He had to find those

women before they used this Bowl of the Winds. And failing that. . . . He disliked people meddling
with his carefully laid plans. Those who did so and lived, lived to pay.

The gholam stepped into the room cautiously, nostrils already twitching with the scent of still
hot blood. The livid burn on its cheek seemed like a live coal. The gholam appeared to be
merely a slender man, a little taller than average in this time, yet it had never encountered
anything that could harm it. Until that man with the medallion. What might have been smile or
snarl bared its teeth. Curious, it peered around the room, but there was nothing beyond the
crushed corpse on the floor tiles. And a . . . feel . . . of something. Not the One Power, but
something that made it . . . itch, if not quite in the same way. Curiosity had brought it here. Parts
of the grille over the window were crushed, pulling the whole thing loose at the sides. The
gholam seemed to remember something that made it itch in that manner, yet so much of what it
recalled was fogged and dim. The world had changed, as it seemed, in the blink of an eye. There
had been a world of war and killing on a huge scale, with weapons that reached across miles,
across thousands of miles, and then there was . . . this. But the gholam had not changed. It was
still the most dangerous weapon of all.
Its nostrils flared again, though it was not by scent that it tracked those who could channel. The
One Power had been used below, and miles to the north. To follow, or not? The man who had
wounded it was not with them; it had made sure of that before leaving the high vantage place. The one
who commanded it wanted the man who had wounded it dead perhaps as much as he did the women,
but the women were an easier target. The women had been named, too, and for the time being, it was
constrained. For its entire existence it had been compelled to obey one or another human, but its mind
held the concept of not being constrained. It must follow the women. It wanted to follow. The moment
of death, when it felt the ability to channel vanish along with life, produced ecstasy. Rapture. But it
was hungry, too, and there was time. Where they could run, it could follow. Settling fluidly beside the
mangled body, it began to feed. Fresh blood, hot blood, was a necessity, but human blood always
held the sweetest savor.

CHAPTER
3

A Pleasant Ride

F arms and pastures and olive groves covered most of the land around Ebou Dar, but many
small forests stretched a few miles across as well, and while the ground was much flatter than
the Rhannon Hills to the south, it rolled and sometimes rose in a prominence of a hundred feet or
higher, sufficient to cast deep shadows in the afternoon sun. All in all, the country provided more
than enough cover to keep unwanted eyes from what might have passed as some odd merchant’s
pack train, nearly fifty people mounted and almost as many afoot, especially when it had
Warders to find unfrequented paths through the undergrowth. Elayne did not sight a mark of
human habitation beyond a few goats cropping on some of the hills.
Even plants and trees used to heat were beginning to wither and die, yet at any other time she
might have enjoyed merely seeing the countryside. It could have been a thousand leagues from the
land she had seen riding down the other bank of the Eldar. The hills were strange, knobby shapes, as
though squeezed together by huge, careless hands. Flocks of brilliantly hued birds soared up at their
passing, and a dozen sorts of hummingbirds flitted away from the horses, hovering jewels on blurred
wings. Thick vines hung like ropes in some places, and there were trees with bundles of narrow
fronds at the top for foliage, and things that looked like green feather dusters as tall as a man. A
handful of plants, fooled by the heat, struggled to put out blossoms, bright reds and vivid yellows,
some twice as wide as her two hands. Their perfume was lush and—“sultry” came to mind. She saw
some boulders she would have wagered had once been toes on a statue, though why anyone would
make a statue that large with bare feet she could not imagine, and another time the way led through a
forest of thick fluted stones among the trees, the weathered stumps of columns, many toppled and all
long since mined almost to the ground for their stone by local farmers. A pleasant ride despite the
dust the horses’ hooves raised from parched soil. The heat did not touch her, of course, and there
were not very many flies. All the dangers lay behind them; they had outrun the Forsaken, and no
chance any of them or their servants could catch up now. It could have been a pleasant ride, except. . .
.
For one thing, Aviendha learned that the message she had sent about enemies coming when least
expected had not been delivered. At first Elayne felt relief at anything to change the topic from Rand.
It was not the jealousy come back; rather, more and more she found herself wanting what Aviendha

had shared with him. Not jealousy. Envy. She would almost have preferred the other. Then she began
really hearing what her friend was saying in a low monotone, and the hair on the back of her neck
tried to stand.
“You can’t do that,” she protested, reining her horse closer to Aviendha’s. Actually, she
supposed Aviendha would not have much trouble drubbing Kurin, or tying her up, or any of the rest. If
the other Sea Folk women stood still for it, anyway. “We can’t start a war with them, certainly not
before we use the Bowl. And not over this,” she added hastily. “Not at all.” They certainly were not
going to start a war before or after the Bowl was used. Not just because the Windfinders were
behaving more high-handedly by the hour. Not just because. . . . Drawing breath, she hurried on. “If
she had told me, I would not have known what you meant. I understand why you couldn’t speak more
clearly, but you do see, don’t you?”
Aviendha glared ahead at nothing, absently brushing flies away from her face. “Without fail, I
told her,” she grumbled. “Without fail! What if he had been one of the Shadowsouled? What if he had
managed to get by me through the gateway, and you with no warning? What if . . . ?” She turned a
suddenly forlorn gaze on Elayne. “I will bite my knife,” she said sadly, “but my liver may burst for
it.”
Elayne was about to say that swallowing her anger was the right thing to do and she could pitch
as large a fit as she wanted so long as she did not hurl it at the Atha’an Miere—that was what all that
about knives and livers meant—but before she could open her mouth, Adeleas brought her rangy gray
up on her other side. The white-haired sister had acquired a new saddle in Ebou Dar, a gaudy thing
worked with silver on pommel and cantle. The flies seemed to avoid her, for some reason, though she
wore a scent as strong as any of the flowers.
“Pardon me. I could not help overhearing that last.” Adeleas did not sound at all apologetic, and
Elayne wondered just how much she had overheard. She felt her cheeks coloring. Some of what
Aviendha had said about Rand had been remarkably frank and straightforward. Some of what she had
said had been, too. It was one thing to talk that way with your nearest friend, quite another to suspect
someone else had been listening. Aviendha seemed to feel the same way; she did not blush, but the
sour look she shot at the Brown would have done Nynaeve proud.
Adeleas merely smiled, a vague smile as bland as water soup. “It might be best if you gave your
friend there free rein with the Atha’an Miere.” She peered past Elayne at Aviendha, blinking. “Well,
a loose rein. Putting the fear of the Light into them ought to be sufficient. They’re almost there already,
in case you haven’t noticed. They’re much more wary of the ‘savage’ Aiel—forgive me, Aviendha—
than they are of Aes Sedai. Merilille would have suggested it, but her ears are still burning.”
Aviendha’s face rarely gave much away, but right then she looked as puzzled as Elayne felt.
Elayne twisted in her saddle to frown behind her. Merilille rode abreast with Vandene, Careane, and
Sareitha not far back, all very studiously looking at anything except Elayne. Beyond the sisters were
the Sea Folk, still in single file, and then would come the Knitting Circle, keeping themselves out of
sight for the moment just ahead of the packhorses. They were threading their way through the glades
of truncated columns. Fifty or a hundred long-tailed red-and-green birds winged over their heads,
filling the air with chattering cries.
“Why?” Elayne asked curtly. It seemed foolish to add to the turmoil already bubbling just below
the surface—and sometimes on the surface—but she had seen no hint of the fool in Adeleas. The
Brown sister’s eyebrows rose in apparent surprise. Maybe she was surprised; Adeleas usually
thought anyone should see what she saw. Maybe.
“Why? To restore a little balance, that is why. If the Atha’an Miere feel they need us to protect

them from an Aiel, it might be a useful balance against. . . .” Adeleas paused slightly, suddenly
absorbed in adjusting her pale gray skirts. “. . . other things.”
Elayne’s face tightened. Other things. The bargain with the Sea Folk was what Adeleas meant.
“You may ride with the others,” she said coolly.
Adeleas made no protest, no attempts to press her argument. She just inclined her head and let
her horse fall back. Her small smile never altered a whit. The older Aes Sedai accepted that Nynaeve
and Elayne stood above them and spoke with Egwene’s authority at their backs, but the truth was, that
changed little beyond the surface. Perhaps nothing. They were outwardly respectful, they obeyed, and
yet. . . .
After all was said and done, Elayne, at least, was Aes Sedai at an age when most initiates of the
Tower still wore novice white and very few had reached the Accepted. And she and Nynaeve had
agreed to that bargain, hardly a display of wisdom and acumen. Not just the Sea Folk getting the
Bowl, but twenty sisters going to the Atha’an Miere, subject to their laws, required to teach anything
the Windfinders wanted to learn and unable to leave until others came to replace them. Windfinders
allowed to enter the Tower as guests, allowed to learn whatever they wished, leave whenever they
wished. Those alone would make the Hall scream, and probably Egwene as well, yet the rest. . . .
Every last one of the older sisters thought she would have found a way around making that bargain.
Perhaps they really could have. Elayne did not believe it, but she was not sure.
She did not say anything to Aviendha, but after a few moments, the other woman spoke. “If I can
serve honor and help you at the same time, I do not care whether it serves some Aes Sedai end.” She
never seemed to take it in that Elayne was also Aes Sedai, not completely.
Elayne hesitated, then nodded. Something had to be done to temper the Sea Folk. Merilille and
the others had displayed a remarkable forbearance so far, but how long would that last? Nynaeve
might explode, once she actually turned her attentions to the Windfinders. Matters had to be kept as
smooth as possible for as long as possible, but if the Atha’an Miere went on believing they could
stare down any Aes Sedai, there would be trouble. Life was more complex than she had imagined
back in Caemlyn, no matter how many lessons she had received as Daughter-Heir. So much more
complicated since she entered the Tower.
“Just don’t be too . . . emphatic,” she said softly. “And please have a care. There are twenty of
them, after all, and only one of you. I wouldn’t want anything to happen before I could help you.”
Aviendha gave her a grin with a good bit of wolf in it and drew her dun mare off at the edge of the
stones to wait for the Atha’an Miere.
From time to time Elayne glanced back, but all she saw through the trees was Aviendha riding
next to Kurin, speaking quite calmly and not even looking at the Sea Folk woman. Certainly not
glaring, though Kurin seemed to stare at her with considerable astonishment. When Aviendha thumped
her horse back up to join Elayne, flapping her reins—she would never be a horsewoman—Kurin rode
forward to speak with Renaile, and a short time later Renaile angrily sent Rainyn to the head of the
column.
The most junior of the Windfinders sat her horse even more awkwardly than Aviendha, whom
she pretended to ignore on Elayne’s other side just as she ignored the small green flies buzzing around
her dark face. “Renaile din Calon Blue Star,” she said stiffly, “demands that you snub in the Aiel
woman, Elayne Aes Sedai.” Aviendha grinned toothily at her, and Rainyn must have been watching at
least a little, because her cheeks reddened beneath the sheen of sweat.
“Tell Renaile that Aviendha is not Aes Sedai,” Elayne replied. “I will ask her to be careful,” no
lie there; she had, and would again, “but I can’t make her do anything.” On impulse, she added, “You

know how Aiel are.” The Sea Folk had some very odd ideas of how the Aiel were. Rainyn stared
wide-eyed at a still-grinning Aviendha, her face going gray, then jerked her horse around and
galloped back to Renaile, bouncing in her saddle.
Aviendha gave a pleased chuckle, but Elayne wondered whether the whole notion had been a
mistake. Even with a good thirty paces between them, she could see Renaile’s face swell up at
Rainyn’s report, and the others began to buzz like bees. They did not look frightened, they looked
angry, and the glares they directed at the Aes Sedai ahead of them grew baleful. Not at Aviendha, at
the sisters. Adeleas nodded thoughtfully when she saw that, and Merilille just barely failed to hide a
smile. At least they were pleased.
If that had been the only incident during the ride it would have taken the edge off any enjoyment
of flowers and birds, but it was not even the first. Beginning shortly after leaving the clearing, the
Knitting Circle had made their way forward to Elayne one by one, all but Kirstian, and no doubt she
would have come too had she not been ordered to keep Ispan shielded. One by one they came, each
hesitant, smiling timorously until Elayne wanted to tell them to act their ages. They certainly made no
demands, and they were too smart to ask straight out for what already had been denied, but they found
other paths.
“It occurred to me,” Reanne said brightly, “that you must want to question Ispan Sedai quite
urgently. Who can say what else she was up to in the city besides trying to find the storeroom?” She
pretended to just be making conversation, but from time to time she darted quick looks at Elayne to
see how she was taking it. “I’m sure we’ll take over an hour to reach the farm, the way we’re going,
perhaps two, and you certainly don’t want to waste two hours. The herbs Nynaeve Sedai gave her
make her quite talkative, and I’m sure she would sit up for sisters.”
The bright smile faded when Elayne said that questioning Ispan could wait and would. Light, did
they really expect anyone to ask questions riding through forests on paths that barely deserved the
name? Reanne rode back to the other Kinswomen muttering to herself.
“Forgiveness, Elayne Sedai,” Chilares murmured a short time later, the traces of Murandy
clinging to her accent. Her green straw hat matched some of her layered petticoats exactly. “Your
forgiveness, if I intrude.” She did not wear the red belt of a Wise Woman; most of the Knitting Circle
did not. Ivara was a goldsmith, and Eldase supplied lacquerware to the merchants for export;
Chilares was a rug seller, while Reanne herself arranged shipping for small traders. Some worked at
simple tasks—Kirstian ran a tiny weaver’s shop, and Dimana was a seamstress, though a prosperous
one—but then, in the course of their lives, they had all followed many crafts. And used many names.
“Ispan Sedai appears to be unwell,” Chilares said, shifting uneasily in her saddle. “Perhaps the herbs
are affecting her more than Nynaeve Sedai thought. It would be terrible if anything happened to her.
Before she can be questioned, I mean. Perhaps the sisters would look at her? Healing, you know. . . .”
She trailed off, blinking those big brown eyes nervously. As well she might, with Sumeko among her
companions.
A glance back showed the stout woman standing in her stirrups to peer past the Windfinders,
until she saw Elayne looking and sat back down hurriedly. Sumeko, who knew more of Healing than
any sister except Nynaeve. Perhaps more than Nynaeve. Elayne simply pointed to the rear until
Chilares colored and reined her mount around.
Merilille joined Elayne only moments after Reanne left, and the Gray sister made a much better
pretense at simple chat than the Kinswoman had. In her manner of speaking, at least, she was poise
itself. What she had to say was another matter. “I wonder how trustworthy those women are, Elayne.”
Her lips pursed in distaste as she brushed dust from her divided blue skirts with a gloved hand. “They

say they do not take in wilders, but Reanne herself may well be a wilder, whatever she claims about
failing her test for Accepted. Sumeko, as well, and certainly Kirstian.” A slight frown for Kirstian, a
dismissive shake of her head. “You must have noticed how she leaps at any mention of the Tower.
She knows no more than she might have picked up in conversation with someone who really was put
out.” Merilille sighed, regretting what she had to say; she really was very good. “Have you
considered that they may be lying about other things? They could be Darkfriends, for all we know, or
dupes of Darkfriends. Perhaps not, but they are hardly to be trusted very far. I believe there is a farm,
whether they really use it for a retreat or not, or I would not have agreed to this, but I will not be
surprised to find a few ramshackle buildings and a dozen or so wilders. Well, not ramshackle—they
do seem to have coin—but the principle is the same. No, they are simply not trustworthy.”
Elayne began a slow burn as soon as she realized the direction Merilille was taking, and it grew
hotter. As this slipping around, all this “may” and “could” so the woman could insinuate things she
herself did not believe. Darkfriends? The Knitting Circle had fought Darkfriends. Two had died. And
without Sumeko and Ieine, Nynaeve might be dead instead of Ispan a prisoner. No, the reason they
were not to be trusted was not because Merilille feared they were sworn to the Shadow, or she would
have said so. They were not to be trusted because if they were not trusted, then they could not be
allowed to hold Ispan.
She swatted a big green fly that had settled on Lioness’s neck, punctuating Merilille’s last word
with a loud crack, and the Gray sister jerked in surprise. “How dare you?” Elayne breathed. “They
faced Ispan and Falion in the Rahad, and the gholam, not to mention two dozen or more toughs with
swords. You weren’t there.” That was hardly fair. Merilille and the rest had been left behind because
Aes Sedai in the Rahad, obvious Aes Sedai, might as well be trumpets and drums for the attention
they attracted. She did not care. Her anger grew by the moment, and her voice rose by the word. “You
will never suggest such a thing to me again. Never! Not without hard evidence! Not without proof! If
you do, I’ll set you a penance that will make your eyes pop!” No matter how high she stood above the
other woman, she had no authority to set her any penance at all, but she did not care about that, either.
“I’ll make you walk the rest of the way to Tar Valon! Eating nothing but bread and water the entire
way! I’ll put you in their charge, and tell them to slap you down if you say boo to a goose!”
It dawned on her that she was shouting. Some sort of gray-and-white birds went flittering past
overhead in a broad band, and she was drowning out their cries. Drawing a deep breath, she tried to
calm herself. She did not have a voice for shouting; it always came out as a shriek. Everyone was
looking at her, most in astonishment. Aviendha nodded approvingly. Of course, she would have done
the same had Elayne plunged a knife into Merilille’s heart. Aviendha stood beside her friends no
matter what. Merilille’s Cairhienin paleness had become dead white.
“I mean what I say,” Elayne told her, in a much cooler tone. It seemed to make even more blood
leave Merilille’s face. She did mean every word; they could not afford that sort of rumor floating
among them. One way or another she would see it done, though the Knitting Circle very likely would
faint.
She hoped that was the end of it. It should have been. But when Chilares left, Sareitha replaced
her, and she too had a reason the Kinswomen were not to be trusted. Their ages. Even Kirstian
claimed to be older than any living Aes Sedai, while Reanne was over a hundred years more than that
and not even the oldest of the Kin. Her title of Eldest went to the oldest of them in Ebou Dar, and the
rigid schedule they followed to avoid notice had a number of still older women off in other places. It
was obviously impossible, Sareitha maintained.
Elayne did not shout; she very carefully did not shout. “We will learn the truth eventually,” she

told Sareitha. She did not doubt the Kinswomen’s word, but there had to be a reason why the
Kinswomen looked neither ageless nor anything near the ages they claimed. If she could only puzzle it
out. Something told her it was obvious, but nothing leaped up that said what. “Eventually,” she added
firmly when the Brown opened her mouth again. “That will be enough, Sareitha.” Sareitha nodded
uncertainly and fell back. Not ten minutes later, Sibella replaced her.
Every time one of the Kinswomen came to make her roundabout plea to be relieved of Ispan, one
of the sisters came soon after to offer the same plea. All save Merilille, who still blinked whenever
Elayne looked at her. Perhaps shouting did have its uses. Certainly no one else tried to be so
straightforward in attacking the Kin.
For instance, Vandene began with discussing the Sea Folk and how to counter the effects of the
bargain made with them, why it was necessary to counter them as much as possible. She was quite
matter-of-fact, with never a word or gesture to lay any blame. Not that she needed any; the subject did
that, however delicately handled. The White Tower, she said, maintained its influence in the world
not by force of arms, or persuasion, or even by plotting or manipulation, though those two she brushed
past lightly. Rather the White Tower controlled or influenced events to whatever extent they did
because everyone saw the Tower as standing apart and above, more even than kings or queens. That
in turn depended on every Aes Sedai being seen that way, as mysterious and apart, different from
everyone else. A different flesh. Historically, Aes Sedai who could not manage that—and there were
a few—were kept out of public view as much as possible.
It took Elayne a little while to realize that the thrust of the conversation had shifted away from
the Sea Folk, and to see where it was headed. A different flesh, mysterious and apart, could not have
a sack thrust over its head and be tied across a saddle. Not where anyone who was not Aes Sedai
could see, anyway. In truth, the sisters would be rougher on Ispan than the Knitting Circle could
possibly make themselves be, just not in public. The argument might have borne more weight had it
come first, but as it was, Elayne sent Vandene packing as quickly as she did anyone else. And saw her
replaced by Adeleas, right after Sibella was told that if none of the Knitting Circle could understand
what Ispan was mumbling, then none of the sisters was likely to either. Mumbling! Light! The Aes
Sedai took their repeated turns, and even knowing what they were up to, sometimes it was hard to see
the connection at first. By the time Careane began by telling her that those boulders really had been
toes once, supposedly on a statue of some warrior queen nearly two hundred feet high. . . .
“Ispan stays where she is,” she told Careane coolly without waiting for more. “Now, unless you
really want to tell me why the Shiotans thought of putting up a statue like that. . . .” The Green said
ancient records claimed it had worn little more than armor, and not a great deal of that! A queen!
“No? Then, if you don’t mind, I’d like to talk with Aviendha alone. Thank you so much.” Even being
curt did not stop them, of course. She was surprised they did not send Merilille’s maid to take a turn.
None of this would have happened had Nynaeve been where she was meant to be. At least,
Elayne was sure that Nynaeve could have quelled the Knitting Circle and the sisters both, in short
order. She was a great one for quelling. The problem was that Nynaeve had glued herself tight to
Lan’s side before they left the first clearing. The Warders scouted ahead and to both sides of their
path, and sometimes to the rear, only riding back to the column long enough to report what they had
seen or give directions on how to avoid a farm or a shepherd. Birgitte ranged far, never spending
more than moments with Elayne. Lan ranged farther. And where Lan went, Nynaeve went.
“No one’s making any trouble, are they?” she demanded with a dark stare for the Sea Folk, the
first time she followed Lan back. “Well, that’s all right, then,” she said before Elayne had a chance to
open her mouth. Spinning her round-bellied mare like a racer, she flicked the reins and galloped after

Lan holding her hat on with one hand, catching up to him just as he vanished around the flank of the
hill ahead. Of course, then there really was nothing to complain about. Reanne had made her visit, and
Merilille hers, and everything seemed settled.
By the next time Nynaeve appeared, Elayne had suffered through a number of disguised attempts
to have Ispan turned over to the sisters, Aviendha had spoken to Kurin, and the Windfinders were on
a slow boil, but when Elayne explained, Nynaeve simply looked around, frowning. Of course, right at
that moment everyone had to be where they belonged. The Atha’an Miere wore glares, true, but the
Knitting Circle were all behind them, and as for the other sisters, no group of novices could have
appeared more well-behaved and innocent. Elayne wanted to shriek!
“I’m sure you can handle everything, Elayne,” Nynaeve said. “You have had all that training to
be a queen. This can’t be anywhere near so—Drat the man! He’s going again! You can handle it.”
And off she went, galloping that poor mare as though it were a warhorse.
That was when Aviendha chose to discuss how Rand seemed to like kissing the sides of her
neck. And incidentally how much she had liked it. Elayne had liked that when he did it to her, too, but
however used to discussing this sort of thing she had become—uncomfortably used to it—she did not
want to talk about it right then. She was angry with Rand. It was unfair, but if not for him, she could
have told Nynaeve to stop treating Lan like a child who might trip over his own feet and attend to her
own duties. She almost wanted to blame him for the way the Knitting Circle was behaving, too, and
the other sisters, and the Windfinders. It’s one of the things men are for, taking the blame , she
remembered Lini saying once, and laughing while she did. They usually deserve it, even if you don’t
know exactly how. Not fair, yet she wished he were there long enough for her to box his ears, just
once. Long enough to kiss him, to have him kiss the sides of her neck softly. Long enough to. . . .
“He will listen to advice, even when he doesn’t like hearing it,” she said abruptly, her face
reddening. Light, for all her talk about shame, in some areas Aviendha had none. And it seemed that
she herself no longer had any, either! “But if I tried to push him, he dug in his heels even when it was
plain that I was right. Was he that way with you?”
Aviendha glanced at her and appeared to understand. Elayne was not sure whether she liked that
or not. At least there was no more talk of Rand and kissing. For a while, anyway. Aviendha had some
knowledge of men—she had traveled with them as a Maiden of the Spear, fought beside them—but
she had never wanted to be anything but Far Dareis Mai, and there were . . . gaps. Even with her
dolls as a child she had always played at the spears and raiding. She had never flirted, did not
understand it, and she did not understand why she felt the way she did when Rand’s eyes fell on her,
or a hundred other things Elayne had begun learning the first time she noticed a boy looking at her
differently than he did at the other boys. She expected Elayne to teach her all of it, and Elayne tried.
She really could talk to Aviendha about anything. If only Rand had not been the example used quite so
often. If he had been there, she would have boxed his ears. And kissed him. Then boxed his ears
again.
Not a pleasant ride at all. A miserable ride.
Nynaeve made several more brief visits, before finally coming to announce that the Kin’s farm
lay just ahead, out of sight around a low rounded hill that appeared ready to fall on its side. Reanne
had been pessimistic in her estimate; the sun had not fallen nearly two hours’ worth.
“We’ll be there very quickly, now,” Nynaeve told Elayne, not seeming to notice the sullen stare
Elayne gave in return. “Lan, fetch Reanne up here, please. Best if they see a familiar face right off.”
He whirled his horse away, and Nynaeve turned in her saddle briefly to fix the sisters with a firm eye.
“I don’t want you frightening them, now. You hold your tongues until we have a chance to explain

what’s what. And hide your faces. Pull up the hoods of your cloaks.” Straightening without waiting
for any reply, she gave a satisfied nod. “There. All settled, and all right. I vow, Elayne, I don’t know
what you were moaning so about. Everyone’s doing exactly as they should, so far as I can see.”
Elayne ground her teeth. She wished they were in Caemlyn already. That was where they were
heading once this was done. She had duties long overdue in Caemlyn. All she had to deal with there
was convincing the stronger Houses that the Lion Throne was hers despite her long absence, that and
handling a rival claimant or two. There might not have been any had she been there when her mother
vanished, when she died, but the history of Andor said there would be by now. Somehow, it seemed
ever so much easier than this.

CHAPTER
4

A Quiet Place

T he Kin’s farm lay in a broad hollow surrounded by three low hills, a sprawling affair of
more than a dozen large, white-plastered buildings with flat roofs, gleaming in the sun. Four
great barns were built right into the slope of the highest hill, a flat-topped thing with one side
that fell away in steep cliffs beyond the barns. A few tall trees that had not lost all of their leaves
provided a modicum of shade in the farmyard. To the north and east, olive groves marched away
and even up the sides of the hills. A sort of slow bustle enveloped the farm, with easily over a
hundred people in evidence despite the afternoon heat, carrying on all the everyday tasks but
none quickly.
It might almost have passed for a small village instead of a farm, except that there was not a man
or a child to be seen. Elayne did not expect any. This was a waypoint for Kinswomen passing through
Ebou Dar to elsewhere, so there would not be too many in the city itself at one time, but that was a
secret matter, as secret as the Kin themselves. Publicly this farm was known for two hundred miles or
more as a retreat for women, a place for contemplation and escape from the cares of the world for a
time, a few days, a week, sometimes longer. Elayne could almost feel serenity in the air. She might
have regretted bringing the world into this quiet place, except that she also brought new hope.
The first appearance of the horses coming around the leaning hill produced far less stir than she
expected. A number of the women stopped to watch, but no more than that. Their clothing varied
widely—Elayne even saw a sheen of silk here and there—but some carried baskets and others
buckets, or great white bundles of what had to be wash. One held a pair of bound ducks by the feet in
either hand. Noblewoman and craftswoman, farmer and beggar, all were equally welcome here, but
everyone did a share of the work during her stay. Aviendha touched Elayne’s arm, then pointed to the
top of one of the hills, a thing like an inverted funnel skewed to one side. Elayne added a hand to the
shade of her hat and after a moment saw movement. Small wonder no one was surprised. Lookouts up
there could see anyone coming from a long way.
A middling woman walked out to meet them short of the farm buildings. Her dress was in the
Ebou Dari style, with a deep narrow neckline, but her dark skirts and brightly colored petticoats were
short enough that she did not need to hold them up out of the dust. She did not wear a marriage knife;
the Kin’s rules prohibited marriage. The Kin had too many secrets to keep.

“That’s Alise,” Reanne murmured, reining in between Nynaeve and Elayne. “She runs the farm
this turn. She’s very intelligent.” Almost like an afterthought, she added, even more quietly, “Alise
does not suffer fools gladly.” As Alise approached, Reanne drew herself up in her saddle, squaring
her shoulders as though for an ordeal.
Middling was exactly how Elayne thought of Alise, not someone to give Reanne pause, certainly,
even had she not been the Eldest of the Knitting Circle. Straight-backed, Alise appeared to be
somewhere in her middle years, neither slender nor stout, tall nor short, a little gray flecking dark
brown hair that was tied back with a piece of ribbon, but in a very practical manner. Her face was
unremarkable, though pleasant enough, a mild face, perhaps a little long in the jaw. When she saw
Reanne, she gave a fleeting look of surprise, then smiled. That smile transformed everything. It did
not make her beautiful or even pretty, but Elayne felt warmed by it, comforted.
“I hardly expected to see you . . . Reanne,” Alise said, barely hesitating over the name.
Obviously she was unsure whether to use Reanne’s rightful title in front of Nynaeve and Elayne and
Aviendha. She studied them with quick glances as she spoke. There seemed to be a bit of Tarabon in
her voice. “Berowin brought word of trouble in the city, of course, but I didn’t think it was so bad you
would have to leave. Who are all these. . . .” Her words trailed off, and her eyes widened, staring
beyond them.
Elayne glanced back, nearly loosing a few of the choice phrases she had picked up in various
places, most recently from Mat Cauthon. She did not understand all of them, not most of them really—
nobody ever wanted to explain what they meant exactly—but they did have a way of relieving
emotion. The Warders had doffed their color-shifting cloaks, and the sisters had drawn up the hoods
of their dust-cloaks as instructed, even Sareitha, who had no need to hide her youthful face, but
Careane had not pulled hers forward far enough. It simply framed her ageless features. Not everyone
would know what they were seeing, yet anyone who had been in the Tower surely would. Careane
jerked the hood forward at Elayne’s glare, but the damage was done.
Others at the farm beside Alise possessed sharp eyes. “Aes Sedai!” a woman howled in tones
suitable for announcing the end of the world. Perhaps she was, for her world. Shrieks spread like dust
blown on the wind, and that quickly, the farm became a kicked anthill. Here and there a woman
simply fainted dead away, but most ran wildly, screaming, dropping what they carried, bumping into
one another, falling down and scrambling up to run on. Flapping ducks and chickens and short-horned
black goats darted wildly to avoid being trampled. In the midst of it all, some women stood gaping,
plainly those who had come to the retreat with no knowledge of the Kin, though a few of them began
to move hurriedly, too, caught up in the frenzy.
“Light!” Nynaeve barked, yanking her braid. “Some of them are running into the olive groves!
Stop them! The last thing we want is a panic! Send the Warders! Quick, quick!” Lan raised a
questioning eyebrow, but she waved a peremptory hand at him. “Quick! Before they all run away!”
With a nod that seemed to begin as a shake of his head, he sent Mandarb galloping after the other men,
curving to avoid the spreading pandemonium among the buildings.
Elayne shrugged at Birgitte, then motioned her to follow. She agreed with Lan. It seemed a bit
late to try stopping a panic, and Warders on horseback attempting to herd frightened women probably
was not the best way. But she could not see how to change matters now, and there was no point letting
them run off into the countryside. They would all want to hear the news she and Nynaeve brought.
Alise gave no sign of running, or even fidgeting. Her face paled slightly, but she stared up at
Reanne with a steady gaze. A firm gaze. “Why?” she breathed. “Why, Reanne? I could not have
imagined you doing this! Did they give you bribes? Offer immunity? Will they let you walk free while

we pay the price? They probably won’t allow it, but I vow I’ll ask them to let me call you down. Yes,
you! The rules apply even to you, Eldest! If I can find a way to manage it, I vow you won’t walk away
from this smiling!” A very firm gaze. Steely, in fact.
“It isn’t what you think,” Reanne said hurriedly, dismounting and dropping her reins. She caught
both of Alise’s hands in hers despite the other woman’s efforts to free them. “Oh, I did not want it to
be like this. They know, Alise. About the Kin. The Tower has always known. Everything. Almost
everything. But that isn’t what is important.” Alise’s eyebrows tried to climb onto her scalp at that,
but Reanne rushed on, beaming eagerly from under her large straw hat. “We can go back, Alise. We
can try again. They said we can.” The farm buildings seemed to be emptying as well, women rushing
out to learn what the commotion was, then joining the flight without a pause for more than hiking
skirts. Shouts from the olive groves said the Warders were at work, but not how much they were
achieving. Perhaps not a great deal. Elayne sensed growing frustration from Birgitte, and irritation.
Reanne eyed the turmoil and sighed. “We must gather them in, Alise. We can go back.”
“That’s all very well for you and some of the others,” Alise said doubtfully. “If it’s true. What
about the rest of us? The Tower would not have let me stay as long as I did had I been quicker to
learn.” She darted a frown at the now well-hooded sisters, and the stare she returned to Reanne held
no little anger. “What would we go back for? To be told again we aren’t strong enough and be sent on
our way? Or will they just keep us as novices the rest of our lives? Some might accept that, but I
won’t. What for, Reanne? What for?”
Nynaeve climbed down, tugging her mare forward at the end of her reins, and Elayne imitated
her, though leading Lioness more easily. “To be part of the Tower, if that’s what you wish,” Nynaeve
said impatiently before even reaching the two Kinswomen. “Maybe to be Aes Sedai. Myself, I don’t
know why you have to be a certain strength, if you can pass the fool tests. Or don’t go back; run away,
for all I care. Once I’m done here, anyway.” Planting her feet, she pulled off her hat and planted her
fists on her hips. “This is wasting time, Reanne, and we have work to do. Are you sure there’s
anybody here we can use? Speak up. If you’re not sure, then we might as well get on with it. The
hurry might be out of the way, but now we have the thing, I’d as soon it was over and done with.”
When she and Elayne were introduced as Aes Sedai, the Aes Sedai who had given the promises,
Alise made a choked sound and began smoothing her woolen skirts as though her hands wanted to
latch on to Reanne’s throat. Her mouth opened angrily—then snapped shut without a sound when
Merilille joined them. That stern gaze did not fade completely, but it became mixed with a touch of
wonder. And more than a touch of wariness.
“Nynaeve Sedai,” Merilille said calmly, “the Atha’an Miere are . . . impatient . . . to be off their
horses. I think some may ask for Healing.” A brief smile flickered across her lips.
That settled that question, though Nynaeve grumbled extravagantly about what she was going to
do to the next person who doubted her. Elayne might have said a few choice words herself, but the
truth was, Nynaeve looked more than a little silly carrying on that way with Merilille and Reanne
both waiting attentively for her to finish and Alise staring at all three. That settled it, or perhaps it
was the Windfinders, afoot and pulling their horses behind them. Every shred of grace had vanished
during the ride, worn away by hard saddles—their legs seemed as stiff as their faces—yet no one
could mistake them for anything but who they were.
“If there are twenty Sea Folk this far from the sea,” Alise muttered, “I’ll believe anything.”
Nynaeve snorted but said nothing, for which Elayne was grateful. The woman seemed to be having a
hard enough time accepting even with Merilille naming them Aes Sedai. Neither tirade nor tantrum
would help.

“Then Heal them,” Nynaeve told Merilille. Their eyes went to the hobbling women together, and
Nynaeve added, “If they ask. Politely.” Merilille smiled again, but Nynaeve had already abandoned
the Sea Folk and gone back to frowning at the now all but empty farm. A few goats still trotted around
a farmyard littered with dropped wash and rakes and brooms, spilled buckets and baskets, not to
mention the crumpled forms of Kinswomen who had fainted, and a handful of chickens had gone back
to scratching and pecking, but the only conscious women still in sight among the farm buildings were
plainly not of the Kin. Some wore embroidered linen or silk and some rough country woolens, yet the
fact that they had not run spoke that much of them. Reanne said that at any given time as many as half
those at the farm might fall into that group. Most appeared stunned.
Despite her grumbling, Nynaeve wasted no time taking charge of Alise. Or perhaps Alise took
charge of Nynaeve. It was difficult to tell, since the Kinswoman showed little of the deference toward
Aes Sedai that the Knitting Circle did. Perhaps she was still just too numbed by the sudden turn of
events. In any case, they moved off together, Nynaeve leading her mare and gesturing with the hat in
her other hand, instructing Alise on how to bring in the scattered women and what to do with them
once they were collected. Reanne had been sure that at least one woman strong enough to join the
circle was there, Garenia Rosoinde, and possibly two more. In truth, Elayne was hoping they had all
gone. Alise alternated between nodding and giving Nynaeve very level looks that Nynaeve seemed
not to notice.
Now, in the wait while the gathering was done, seemed a good time to do a bit more searching
through the panniers, but when Elayne turned toward the packhorses, which were just beginning to be
led toward the farm buildings, she noticed the Knitting Circle, Reanne and the whole lot of them,
making their own way into the farm on foot, some hurrying toward women lying on the ground, others
toward those standing about gaping. The whole lot of them, and no sign of Ispan. It took only a glance
to find her, though. Between Adeleas and Vandene, each holding an arm as they half-dragged her
along, their dust-cloaks streaming behind.
The white-haired sisters were linked, the glow of saidar somehow encompassing them both
without including Ispan. There was no way to tell which led the small circle and held the shield on
the Darkfriend, but not even one of the Forsaken could have broken it. They stopped to speak to a
stout woman in plain brown wool, who gaped at the leather sack covering Ispan’s head but still
curtsied and pointed toward one of the white-plastered buildings.
Elayne exchanged angry glances with Aviendha. Well, hers was angry, anyway. Sometimes
Aviendha gave away no more than a stone. Handing their horses over to two of the palace stablemen,
they hurried after the three. Some of the women who were not of the Kin tried to question them about
what was happening, a few in rather overbearing fashion, but Elayne gave them short shrift, leaving
behind a wake of indignant sniffs and snorts. Oh, what she would not give to have the ageless face
already! That tweaked a thread in the back of her thoughts, but it vanished as soon as she tried to
examine it.
When she pushed open the plain wooden door where the trio had vanished, Adeleas and
Vandene had Ispan seated in a ladder-back chair with her head bare, the sack lying atop a narrow
trestle table with their linen cloaks. The room possessed only one window, set in the ceiling, but with
the sun still high it let in a good light. Shelves lined the walls, stacked with large copper pots and big
white bowls. By the smell of bread baking, the only other door led into a kitchen.
Vandene looked around sharply at the sound of the door, but seeing them, she smoothed her face
to a total lack of expression. “Sumeko said the herbs Nynaeve gave her were wearing off,” she said,
“and it seemed best to question her a little before fuzzing her brain again. We do seem to have time,

now. It would be good to know what the . . . the Black Ajah,” her mouth twisted in distaste, “was up
to in Ebou Dar. And what they know.”
“I doubt they are aware of this farm, since we were not,” Adeleas said, tapping a finger
thoughtfully on her lips as she studied the woman in the chair, “but it is better to be sure than to weep
later, as our father used to say.” She might have been examining an animal she had never seen before,
a creature she could not fathom existing.
Ispan’s lip curled. Sweat rolled down her bruised face, and her dark, beaded braids were
disheveled and her clothing all disarrayed, but despite bleary eyes, she was not nearly so woozy as
she had been. “The Black Ajah, it is a fable, and a filthy one,” she sneered, a trifle hoarsely. It must
have been very hot inside that leather sack, and she had had no water since leaving the Tarasin
Palace. “Me, I am surprised that you will give it voice. And to cast the charge on me! What I have
done, I have done on the orders of the Amyrlin Seat.”
“Elaida?” Elayne spat incredulously. “You have the nerve to claim that Elaida ordered you to
murder sisters and steal from the Tower? Elaida ordered what you did in Tear and Tanchico? Or do
you mean Siuan? Your lies are pathetic! You’ve forsaken the Three Oaths, somehow, and that names
you Black Ajah.”
“I do not have to answer the questions from you,” Ispan said sullenly, hunching her shoulders.
“You are rebels against the lawful Amyrlin Seat. You will be punished, perhaps stilled. Especially if
you harm me. I serve the true Amyrlin Seat, and you will be punished severely if you harm me.”
“You will answer any questions my near-sister asks.” Aviendha tested her belt knife on a
thumbnail, but her eyes were on Ispan’s. “Wetlanders fear pain. They do not know how to embrace it,
accept it. You will answer as you are asked.” She did not glare or snarl, she just spoke, but Ispan
shrank back in the chair.
“I fear that is proscribed, even were she not an initiate of the Tower,” Adeleas said. “We are
forbidden to shed blood in questioning, or to allow others to do so in our name.” She sounded
reluctant, though whether over the prohibition or over admitting that Ispan was an initiate, Elayne
could not say. She herself had not really considered that Ispan might still be considered one. There
was a saying that no woman was finished with the Tower until it was finished with her, but truthfully,
once the White Tower touched you, it never was finished.
Her brow furrowed as she studied the Black sister, so bedraggled, and still so sure of herself.
Ispan sat up a little straighter, and darted glances full of amused contempt at Aviendha—and Elayne.
She had not been so poised earlier, when she thought it was Nynaeve and Elayne alone who had her;
regained composure had come with remembering that there were older sisters present. Sisters who
would hold White Tower law as part of themselves. That law forbade not only shedding blood, but
breaking bones and a number of other things that any Whitecloak Questioner would be more than
ready to do. Before any session began, Healing had to be given, and if the questioning started after
sunrise, it had to end before sundown; if after sunset, then before sunrise. The law was even more
restrictive when it came to initiates of the Tower, the sisters and Accepted and novices, banning the
use of saidar in questioning, punishment, or penance. Oh, a sister might flick a novice’s ear with the
Power if she was exasperated, or even give her a swat on the bottom, but not very much more. Ispan
smiled at her. Smiled! Elayne took a deep breath.
“Adeleas, Vandene, I want you to leave Aviendha and me alone with Ispan.” Her stomach tried
to tie itself into a knot. There had to be a way to press the woman sufficiently to learn what was
needed without breaking Tower law. But how? People who were to be questioned by the Tower
usually began talking before a finger was laid on them—everyone knew that no one held out against

the Tower; no one!—but they were very seldom initiates. She could hear another voice, not Lini’s
this time, but her mother’s. What you order done, you must be willing to do with your own hand. As
a queen, what you order done, you have done. If she did break the law. . . . Her mother’s voice
again. Even a queen cannot be above the law, or there is no law. And Lini’s. You can do whatever
you wish, child. So long as you’re willing to pay the price. She dragged her hat off without untying
the ribbons. Keeping her voice steady took an effort. “When we are—when we are done talking with
her, you can take her back to the Knitting Circle.” Afterward, she would submit herself to Merilille.
Any five sisters could sit in judgment to set a penance, if they were asked.
Ispan’s head swung, swollen eyes going from Elayne to Aviendha and back, slowly widening
until the whites showed all the way around. She was not so sure of herself now.
Silent glances passed between Vandene and Adeleas, in the manner of people who had spent so
much time together they hardly needed to speak aloud any longer; then Vandene took Elayne and
Aviendha each by an arm. “If I may speak with you outside a moment,” she murmured. It sounded a
suggestion, but she was already urging them to the door.
Outside in the farmyard, perhaps two dozen or so Kinswomen were huddled together like sheep.
Not all wore Ebou Dari clothes, but two had the red belts of Wise Women, and Elayne recognized
Berowin, a stout little woman who normally showed a pride far greater than her strength in the
Power. Not now. Like the rest, her face was frightened, her eyes darting, despite the entire Knitting
Circle surrounding them and talking urgently. Down the way, Nynaeve and Alise were trying to herd
perhaps twice as many women inside one of the larger buildings. “Trying” did seem to be the word.
“. . . don’t care what estates you hold,” Nynaeve was shouting at a proud-necked woman in pale
green silk. “You get in there and stay in there, out of the way, or I’ll kick you inside!”
Alise simply seized the green-clad woman by the scruff of the neck and ran her through the
doorway despite voluble and heated protests. There was a loud squawk like a huge goose being
stepped on, then Alise reappeared, dusting her hands. The others seemed to give no trouble after that.
Vandene released them, studying their eyes. The glow still enveloped her, yet Adeleas must have
been focusing their combined flows. Vandene could have maintained the shield, once woven, without
being able to see it, but had she been the one, it was much likelier that Adeleas would have brought
them out. Vandene could have gone several hundred paces before the link began to attenuate—it
would not break if she and Adeleas went to opposite corners of the earth, though it would have been
useless long before that—but she remained close to the door. She seemed to sort words in her head.
“I’ve always thought it best if women with experience handle this sort of thing,” she said finally.
“The young can easily be caught up in hot blood. Then they do too much. Or sometimes, they realize
they can’t bring themselves to do enough. Because they haven’t really seen enough, yet. Or worst of
all, they find a . . . taste for it. Not that I believe either of you has that flaw.” She gave Aviendha a
weighing glance without pausing; Aviendha hastily sheathed her belt knife. “Adeleas and I have seen
enough to know why we must do what must be done, and we left hot blood behind long ago. Perhaps
you will leave this to us. Much better that way, all around.” Vandene seemed to take the
recommendation as accepted. She nodded and turned back toward the door.
No sooner had she disappeared behind it, than Elayne felt the use of the Power within, a weave
that must have blanketed the room inside. A ward against eavesdropping, certainly. They would not
want stray ears to catch whatever Ispan said. Then another use hit her, and suddenly the silence from
within was more ominous than any shrieks that ward would contain.
She crushed her hat back onto her head. The heat she could not feel, but the sun’s glare suddenly
made her queasy. “Maybe you’ll help me look over what the packhorses are carrying,” she said

breathily. She had not ordered it done—whatever it was—but that did not seem to change anything.
Aviendha nodded with surprising quickness; she seemed to want to be away from that silence, too.
The Windfinders were waiting not far from where the servants had the pack animals, waiting
impatiently and staring about imperiously, arms folded beneath their breasts, copying Renaile. Alise
marched up to them, marking Renaile out as the leader after one sweeping glance. Elayne and
Aviendha she ignored.
“Come with me,” she said in brisk tones that brooked no argument. “The Aes Sedai say you will
want to be out of the sun until matters are more settled.” The words “Aes Sedai” held as much
bitterness as they did the awe Elayne was used to from Kinswomen. Maybe more. Renaile stiffened,
her dark face growing darker, but Alise plowed on. “You wilders can sit out here and sweat if that’s
what you want, for all of me. If you can sit.” It was obvious none of the Atha’an Miere had received
Healing for their saddle soreness; they stood like women who wanted to forget they existed below the
waist. “What you will not do is keep me waiting.”
“Do you know who I am?” Renaile demanded in a tight fury, but Alise was already walking
away and not looking back. Struggling with herself visibly, Renaile dashed sweat from her forehead
with the back of her hand, then angrily ordered the other Windfinders to leave the “shore-cursed”
horses and follow her. They made a spraddle-legged line wobbling along after Alise, everyone but
the two apprentices muttering to herself—Alise included.
Instinctively, Elayne began to plan how to smooth matters over, how to get the Atha’an Miere’s
pains Healed without them having to ask. Or a sister having to offer too strenuously; Nynaeve had to
be appeased, too, and the other sisters. To her surprise, she suddenly realized that for once in her life
she had no real desire to smooth anything. Watching the Windfinders limp toward one of the farm
buildings, she decided that matters were fine just as they were. Aviendha wore a large, open grin as
she watched the Atha’an Miere. Elayne snatched the much smaller smile from her own face and
turned to the packhorses. They did deserve it, though. Not grinning was very hard.
With Aviendha’s help, the searching went more quickly than before, though Aviendha did not
recognize what they were after as quickly as she did. Not a great surprise. A few of the sisters Elayne
had trained showed a greater skill in this than she did herself, but most came nowhere near. Still, two
sets of hands found more than one, and there was a great deal to be found. Liveried stablemen and
women carried away the rubbish, while a collection of ter’angreal grew on the broad stone lid of a
square cistern.
Four more horses were unloaded quickly, and they accumulated a selection that would have
caused a celebration, brought into the Tower. Even with no one studying ter’angreal. They took
every form imaginable. Cups and bowls and vases, no two the same size or design or in the same
material. A flat, worm-eaten box, half-falling apart and whatever had lined it long since gone to dust,
held pieces of jewelry—a necklace and bracelets set with colored stones, a slim gem-studded belt,
several finger rings—and there were spaces for more. Every single one was a ter’angreal, and they
all matched, meant to be worn together, though Elayne could not imagine why any woman would want
to carry so many about her at one time. Aviendha found a dagger with gold wire wrapped around a
hilt of rough deer-horn; the blade was dull, and by all evidence, always had been. She kept turning
that over and over in her fingers—her hands actually began to tremble—until Elayne took it away
from her and put it with the others on the cistern’s lid. Even then Aviendha stood for a time, looking at
it and licking her lips as though they had gone dry. There were finger rings, earrings, necklaces,
bracelets and buckles, many of very peculiar pattern indeed. There were statuettes and figures of
birds and animals and people, several knives that did have edges, half a dozen large medallions in

bronze or steel, most worked with strange patterns and not one carrying an image Elayne could really
understand, a pair of peculiar hats seemingly made of metal, too ornate and too thin to be helmets, and
any number of items she could not think what to call. A rod, as thick as her wrist, bright red and
smooth and rounded, firm rather than hard for all that it seemed to be stone; it did not warm slightly in
her hand, it almost felt hot! Not real heat any more than the warmth was real, but still! What about a
set of metal basketwork balls, one inside the other? Any movement produced a faint musical chime, a
different tone every time, and she had the feeling that no matter how hard she looked into it, there
would always be a still smaller ball waiting to be discovered. A thing that looked like a blacksmith’s
puzzle made of glass? It was heavy enough that she dropped it, and it broke a chip off the edge of the
cistern cover. A collection to stir amazement in any Aes Sedai. More important, they found two more
angreal. Those Elayne set very carefully aside, within arm’s reach.
One was an odd piece of jewelry, a golden bracelet attached by four flat chains to finger rings,
every bit of it engraved in an intricate mazelike pattern. That was the stronger of the two, stronger
than the turtle still in her pouch. It was made for a smaller hand than hers or Aviendha’s. Strangely,
the bracelet had a tiny lock, complete with a minuscule, tubular key dangling from a fine chain that
was obviously made to be removed. Along with the key! The other was a seated woman in agedarkened ivory, her legs folded in front of her, her exposed knees bare, but with hair so long and
luxuriant she could not have been more muffled in the heaviest cloak. It was not even as strong as the
turtle, but she found it very appealing. One hand rested on a knee, palm up and fingers arranged so the
thumb touched the tips of the middle two fingers, while the other hand was lifted, the first two fingers
raised and the others folded. The whole figure carried an air of supreme dignity, yet the delicately
worked face showed amusement and delight. Maybe it had been made for a particular woman? It
seemed personal, somehow. Perhaps they had done that, in the Age of Legends. Some ter’angreal
were immense, needing men and horses, or even the Power, to move, but most angreal were small
enough to carry about your person; not all, but most.
They were tossing back the canvas covers on another set of wicker panniers when Nynaeve
came striding up. The Atha’an Miere began filing out of one of the farm buildings, no longer limping.
Merilille was talking with Renaile, or rather, the Windfinder was talking and Merilille listening.
Elayne wondered what had happened in there. The slim Gray did not look so satisfied anymore. The
huddle of Kinswomen had grown larger, but even as Elayne looked up, three more came hesitantly
into the farmyard, and another two stood at the edge of the olive trees, peering about indecisively. She
could sense Birgitte, somewhere out among the groves and only a little less irritated than earlier.
Nynaeve glanced at the display of ter’angreal and gave her braid a tug. Her hat had gone
missing somewhere. “That can wait,” she said, sounding disgusted. “It’s time.”

CHAPTER
5

The Breaking Storm

T he sun stood little more than halfway down toward the horizon by the time they clambered
up the well-worn, snaking path to the top of the steep-sided hill above the barns. That was the
spot Renaile had chosen. It did make sense from what Elayne knew of working weather, all
learned from a Sea Folk Windfinder, to be sure. Changing anything beyond your immediate
vicinity required working over long distances, which meant being able to see a long distance,
much easier on the ocean than on land. Except from a mountain or hilltop. It also needed a deft
hand to avoid causing torrential rains or whirlwinds or the Light alone knew what elsewhere.
Whatever you did, the effects spread like ripples from a stone tossed into a pond. She had no
desire whatsoever to lead the circle that would use the Bowl.
The top of the hill was clear of brush and flat, if far from level, a rough stone table, fifty paces
long and broad, with plenty of room for everybody who needed to be there, and some who did not,
strictly speaking. From at least fifty paces above the farm, the spectacular view stretched for miles
over a patchwork quilt of farms and pastures, forests and olive groves. Far too many browns and sere
yellows were mixed in with a hundred shades of green, crying the need for what they were to do, yet
even so, the beauty of it struck Elayne. Despite dust in the air like a faint mist, she could see so far!
The land really was quite flat here except for those few hills. Ebou Dar lay just out of sight to the
south even if she embraced the Power, yet it seemed she should be able to see it, by straining just a
little. Surely with a little effort she could see the River Eldar. A marvelous view. Not everyone was
interested.
“An hour wasted,” Nynaeve grumbled, glaring sideways at Reanne. And at just about everyone
else. With Lan not there, it seemed she might take the opportunity to unleash her temper. “Almost an
hour. Maybe more. Completely wasted. Alise is capable enough, I suppose, but you’d think Reanne
would know who was there! Light! If that fool woman faints on me again . . . !” Elayne hoped she held
on a little longer. It looked to be quite a storm once she let it break.
Reanne tried to keep a cheerful, eager face, yet her hands were never still on her skirts,
constantly plucking and smoothing. Kirstian simply clutched hers and sweated, appearing ready to
empty her stomach any minute; when anyone looked at her, anyone at all, she shivered. The third

Kinswoman, Garenia, was a Saldaean merchant with a strong nose and a wide mouth, a short slimhipped woman, stronger than the other two, who looked not that much older than Nynaeve. A greasy
dampness glistened on her pale face, and her dark eyes grew wider whenever they fell on an Aes
Sedai. Elayne thought she might soon discover whether someone’s eyes actually could pop out of her
head. At least Garenia had stopped moaning, which she had done all the way up the hill.
There really had been another pair who might have been strong enough—possibly; the Kin did
not pay much attention to that—but the last had gone on her way three days past. No one else at the
farm even came close. Which was why Nynaeve was still disgusted. One reason. The other was that
Garenia had been one of the very first found, passed out in the farmyard. For that matter, she fainted
again the first two times she was roused, as soon as her eyes fell on one of the sisters. Of course,
Nynaeve being Nynaeve, she was not about to admit that she should have done anything so simple as
ask Alise who was still at the farm. Or even tell Alise what she was looking for before the woman
inquired. Nynaeve never expected anyone to have sense to know up from down. Except herself.
“We could be done by now!” Nynaeve growled. “We could be shut of—!” She almost quivered
with the effort of not scowling at the Sea Folk as they gathered near the east end of the stone table.
Renaile, gesturing emphatically, appeared to be giving instructions. Elayne would have given a pretty
to hear those.
Nynaeve’s glares certainly took in Merilille and Careane and Sareitha, who still clutched the
silk-wrapped Bowl tightly. Adeleas and Vandene had remained below, sequestered with Ispan. The
three sisters stood chatting together, not paying any mind to Nynaeve unless she spoke to them
directly, but Merilille’s gaze sometimes slipped to the Windfinders, then jerked away; her mask of
serenity faltered slightly, and she licked her lips with the tip of her tongue.
Had she made some mistake down below while Healing them? Merilille had negotiated treaties
and mediated disputes between nations; few in the White Tower were better than she. But Elayne
remembered hearing a story once, a joke of sorts, about a Domani merchant, a Sea Folk Cargomaster
and an Aes Sedai. Not many people told jokes involving Aes Sedai; telling one might not be entirely
safe. The merchant and the Cargomaster found an ordinary rock on the shore and proceeded to sell it
back and forth between them, somehow making a profit each time. Then an Aes Sedai came along.
The Domani convinced the Aes Sedai to buy the simple stone for twice what she herself had last paid.
After which the Atha’an Miere convinced the Aes Sedai to buy the same rock from him for twice that
again. Only a joke, but it showed what people believed. Maybe the older sisters would not have done
any better bargaining with the Sea Folk.
Aviendha strode straight to the edge of the cliffs as soon as she reached the hilltop, and stood
staring north, motionless as a statue. After a moment, Elayne realized that she was not admiring the
view; Aviendha was simply staring. Gathering her skirts a bit awkwardly with the three angreal in
hand, she joined her friend.
The cliff fell in fifty-foot steps to olive groves, steep swathes of ridged gray stone, bare except
for a few small, dying bushes. The drop was not really bothersome, but it was hardly the same as
looking at the ground from the top of a tree, either. Strangely, looking down made Elayne feel a trifle
dizzy. Aviendha did not seem to notice that the edge was right at her toes.
“Is something troubling you?” Elayne asked quietly.
Aviendha kept her gaze on the distance. “I have failed you,” she said finally. Her voice was flat,
empty. “I cannot form the gateway properly, and all saw me shame you. I thought a servant was one of
the Shadowwrought, and behaved worse than foolishly. The Atha’an Miere ignore me and glare at the
Aes Sedai, as if I am an Aes Sedai dog yapping at their command. I pretended I could make the

Shadowrunner talk for you, but no Far Dareis Mai is allowed to question prisoners until she has been
wed to the spear for twenty years, or even to watch until she has carried it ten. I am weak and soft,
Elayne. I cannot bear to shame you further. If I fail you again, I will die.”
Elayne’s mouth went dry. That sounded too close to a promise. Gripping Aviendha’s arm firmly,
she drew her back from the edge. Aiel could be almost as peculiar as the Sea Folk thought they were.
She did not really think Aviendha would jump off—not really—but she was not about to take any
chances. At least the other woman did not try to resist.
Everyone else seemed to be engrossed in themselves, or in each other. Nynaeve had begun
speaking to the Atha’an Miere, both hands tight on her braid and her face almost as dark as theirs
from the strain of not shouting, while they listened with contemptuous arrogance. Merilille and
Sareitha still guarded the Bowl, but Careane was attempting to talk with the Kinswomen, without
much success. Reanne answered, if blinking uneasily and licking her lips, but Kirstian stood
trembling and silent, while Garenia’s eyes were squeezed shut. Elayne kept her voice low anyway;
this was none of their business.
“You haven’t failed anyone, least of all me, Aviendha. Nothing you’ve done has ever shamed
me, and nothing you do ever could.” Aviendha blinked at her doubtfully. “And you’re about as weak
and soft as a stone.” That had to be the oddest compliment she had ever paid anyone, yet Aviendha
actually looked gratified. “I’ll bet the Sea Folk are scared silly of you, too.” Another strange one; it
made Aviendha smile, if only faintly. Elayne drew a breath. “As for Ispan. . . .” She did not like even
thinking about this. “I thought I could do what was necessary, too, but just letting my mind dwell on it
makes my hands sweat and my stomach roil. I’d throw up if I even tried. So we share that.”
Aviendha made the Maiden handtalk sign for “You startle me”; she had started teaching some of
them to Elayne, though she said it was forbidden. Apparently, being near-sisters who were learning to
be more changed that. Except that it did not, really. Aviendha seemed to think her explanation had
been perfectly clear. “I did not mean I could not,” she said aloud, “only that I do not know how.
Likely I would have killed her, trying.” Suddenly she smiled, much wider and warmer than before,
and lightly touched Elayne’s cheek. “We both have weakness in us,” she whispered, “but it brings no
shame so long as only we two know.”
“Yes,” Elayne said weakly. She just did not know how! “Of course it doesn’t.” This woman
contained more surprises than any gleeman. “Here,” she said, pressing the woman-wrapped-in-herhair into Aviendha’s hand. “Use this in the circle.” Letting the angreal go was not easy. She had
intended to use it herself, but smiles or no smiles, her friend’s spirits—her near-sister’s spirits—
needed raising. Aviendha turned the small ivory figure over in her hands; Elayne could almost see her
trying to decide how to give it back. “Aviendha, you know how it feels when you hold as much of
saidar as you can? Think of holding almost twice as much. Really think of it. I want you to use it.
Please?”
Perhaps Aiel did not show a great deal on their faces, but Aviendha’s green eyes widened. They
had discussed angreal, considering their search, but she probably never had thought what it would be
like to use one before this. “Twice as much,” she murmured. “To hold all that. I can barely make
myself imagine. This is a very great gift, Elayne.” She touched Elayne’s cheek again, pressing her
fingertips; that was the Aiel equivalent of a kiss and a hug.
Whatever Nynaeve had to say to the Sea Folk, it did not take long. She stalked away from them
twitching at her skirts furiously. Approaching Elayne, she frowned equally at Aviendha and at the
edge of the cliff. Usually she denied her poor head for heights, but she kept them between herself and
the drop. “I have to talk to you,” she muttered, guiding Elayne a little distance along the hilltop. And

farther from the edge. A little way, but far enough from anyone to avoid being overheard. She drew
several deep breaths before beginning, in a low voice, and she did not look at Elayne.
“I. . . . I’ve been behaving like a fool. It’s that bloody man’s fault! When he’s not right in front of
me, I can hardly think of anything else, and when he is, I can hardly think at all! You . . . you have to
tell me when I . . . when I’m acting the fool. I depend on you, Elayne.” Her voice stayed low, but her
tone became almost a wail. “I can’t afford to lose my wits in a man, not now.”
Elayne was so shocked, she could not speak for a moment. Nynaeve, admitting she had been a
fool? She almost looked to see whether the sun had turned green! “It isn’t Lan’s fault, and you know
it, Nynaeve,” she said at last. She pushed away memories of her own recent thoughts about Rand.
This was not the same. And the opportunity was a gift of the Light. Tomorrow, Nynaeve would likely
try to box her ears if she said Nynaeve was being foolish. “Take hold of yourself, Nynaeve. Stop
behaving like a giddy girl.” Definitely not thoughts of Rand! She had not been mooning over him that
badly! “You’re an Aes Sedai, and you are supposed to be leading us. Lead! And think!”
Folding her hands at her waist, Nynaeve actually hung her head. “I’ll try,” she mumbled. “I will,
truly. You don’t know what it’s like, though. I. . . . I’m sorry.”
Elayne nearly swallowed her tongue. Nynaeve, apologizing on top of the other? Nynaeve,
abashed? Maybe she was ill.
It did not last, of course. Abruptly frowning at the angreal, Nynaeve cleared her throat. “You
gave one to Aviendha, did you?” she said briskly. “Well, I suppose she’s all right. A pity we have to
let the Sea Folk use one. I’ll wager they try to hang on to it! Well, just let them try! Which one is
mine?”
With a sigh, Elayne handed her the bracelet-and-rings, and she stalked away, fumbling the piece
of jewelry onto her left hand and calling loudly for everyone to take their places. Sometimes, it was
difficult to tell Nynaeve leading from Nynaeve bullying. As long as she did lead, though.
The Bowl of the Winds sat atop its unfolded white wrappings in the center of the hilltop, a
shallow, heavy disc of clear crystal two feet across, worked inside with thick swirling clouds. An
ornate piece, yet simple when you thought of what it could do. What they hoped it could do. Nynaeve
took up her place nearby, the angreal finally clicking shut on her wrist. She worked her hand, looking
surprised that the chains did not seem to inconvenience her; it fit as if made for her hand. The three
Kinswomen were already there, Kirstian and Garenia huddling at Reanne’s back and appearing more
frightened than ever, if that was possible. The Windfinders still stood arrayed behind Renaile, almost
twenty paces away.
Lifting her divided skirts, Elayne met Aviendha at the Bowl and eyed the Sea Folk suspiciously.
Did they intend to create a fuss? She had been afraid of exactly that from the first mention of women
at the farm who might be strong enough to join the link. The Atha’an Miere were sticklers for rank
enough to shame the White Tower, and Garenia’s presence meant that Renaile din Calon Blue Star,
Windfinder to the Mistress of the Ships to the Atha’an Miere, would not be part of the circle. Should
not be.
Renaile frowned searchingly at the women around the Bowl. She seemed to be weighing them,
judging their capabilities. “Talaan din Gelyn,” she barked suddenly, “take your station!” It was like a
whip-crack! Even Nynaeve jumped.
Talaan bowed low, touching her heart, then ran to the Bowl. As soon as she moved, Renaile
barked again. “Metarra din Junalle, take your station!” Metarra, plump yet solid, sped on Talaan’s
heels. Neither apprentice was old enough to have earned what the Sea Folk called a “salt name.”
Once begun, Renaile rattled off names quickly, sending Rainyn and two other Windfinders, all of

whom moved quickly, yet not so fast as the apprentices. By the number of their medallions, Naime
and Rysael were higher in rank than Rainyn, dignified women with a quiet air of command, but
markedly weaker. Then Renaile paused, only for a heartbeat, yet in that rapid listing it stood out.
“Tebreille din Gelyn South Wind, take your station! Caire din Gelyn Running Wave, assume the
command!”
Elayne felt a moment of relief that Renaile had not named herself, but it lasted about as long as
Renaile’s pause had. Tebreille and Caire exchanged one look, Tebreille grim and Caire smug, before
moving to the Bowl. Eight earrings and a multitude of overlapping medallions marked each
Windfinder to a Clan Wavemistress. Only Renaile stood above them; only Dorile among the Sea Folk
on the hilltop was their equal. In brocaded yellow silks, Caire was slightly the taller, Tebreille in
brocaded green somewhat sterner of face, both more than handsome women, and it did not take their
names to know them blood sisters. They had the same big, almost black eyes, the same straight nose,
the same strong chin. Caire silently pointed to a spot at her right side; Tebreille did not speak either,
nor did she hesitate in standing where her sister pointed, but her face was stone. With her, a circle of
thirteen women surrounded the Bowl nearly shoulder-to-shoulder. Caire’s eyes almost sparkled.
Tebreille’s were leaden. Elayne was reminded of another of Lini’s sayings. No knife is sharper than
a sister’s hate.
Caire glared around the circle of women surrounding the Bowl, not yet truly a circle, as though
trying to fix each face in her mind. Or maybe to fix her scowl in theirs. Remembering herself, Elayne
hurriedly passed the last angreal, the small amber turtle, to Talaan and started to explain how it was
used. The explanation was simple, yet anyone who tried without knowing how could fumble for
hours. She was not given the chance for five words.
“Silence!” Caire roared. Tattooed fists on her hips and bare feet apart, she belonged on the deck
of a ship going into battle. “There will be no talking on station without my permission. Talaan, report
yourself immediately on returning to your ship.” Nothing in Caire’s tone suggested that she was
speaking to her own daughter. Talaan bowed deeply, touching her heart, and murmured something
inaudible. Caire snorted contemptuously—and gave Elayne a glare that suggested a wish that she
could order her to report herself to someone as well—before going on in a voice that might have been
heard at the base of the hill. “Today, we shall do what has not been done since the Breaking of the
World, when our ancestors fought wind and wave gone mad. By the Bowl of the Winds and the mercy
of the Light, they survived. Today, we will use the Bowl of the Winds, lost to us for more than two
thousand years, and now returned. I have studied the ancient lore, studied the records of the days
when our foremothers first learned the sea and the Weaving of the Winds, and the salt entered our
blood. What is known of the Bowl of the Winds, I know, more than anyone else.” Her eyes cut toward
her sister, a satisfied glance that Tebreille did not acknowledge. Which seemed to satisfy Caire even
more. “What the Aes Sedai cannot do, I will do today, if it pleases the Light. I expect every woman to
stand her station to the last. I will not accept failure.”
The rest of the Atha’an Miere seemed to accept that speech as expected and proper, but the
Kinswomen gaped at Caire in astonishment. In Elayne’s opinion, grandiose did not begin to describe
it; plainly Caire fully expected that the Light would be pleased, and she would be most displeased if
it was not! Nynaeve rolled her eyes to the heavens and opened her mouth. Caire forestalled her.
“Nynaeve,” the Windfinder announced loudly, “you will now demonstrate your skill at linking.
Be about it, woman, and quickly!”
In response, Nynaeve shut her eyes tight. Her lips . . . writhed. She looked about to burst a blood
vessel. “I assume that means I have permission to speak!” she murmured. Fortunately too low to be

heard by Caire, on the far side of the circle. Opening her eyes, she put on a smile that was quite
horrible when added to the rest of her expression. She was a sour stomach and several other
complaints rolled into one.
“The first thing is to embrace the True Source, Caire.” The light ofsaidar suddenly shone bright
around Nynaeve; she was using the angreal on her hand already, by what Elayne could feel. “I
assume you know how to do that, of course.” Ignoring the abrupt tightening of Caire’s mouth, Nynaeve
went on. “Elayne will now assist me in the demonstration. If we have your permission?”
“I prepare myself to embrace the Source,” Elayne put in quickly, before Caire could erupt, “but I
don’t actually embrace it.” She opened herself, and the Windfinders leaned forward, peering at her,
though there really was nothing to see yet. Even Kirstian and Garenia forgot their fear enough to show
interest. “While I’m at this point, the rest is up to Nynaeve.”
“Now I will reach out to her. . . .” Nynaeve paused, looking at Talaan. Elayne had not had a
chance to tell her anything, really. “It’s much the same as with an angreal,” Nynaeve said, addressing
the slender apprentice. Caire growled, and Talaan tried to watch Nynaeve with her head down. “You
open yourself to the Source through an angreal, just as I will through Elayne. As though you mean to
embrace the angreal and the Source at the same time. It isn’t very difficult, really. Watch, and you’ll
see. When it’s time to bring you into the circle, just put yourself on the brink. That way, when I
embrace through you, I’ll embrace through the angreal as well.”
Concentration or no concentration, sweat began to bead on Elayne’s forehead. But then, the heat
had nothing to do with it. The True Source beckoned; it throbbed, and she throbbed with it. It
demanded. The longer she hung just a hairsbreadth from touching the Power, the worse the desire, the
need, would grow. Hanging, she began to tremble slightly. Vandene had told her that the longer you
channeled, the worse that anticipation grew.
“Watch with Aviendha,” Nynaeve told Talaan. “She knows how to—” She caught sight of
Elayne’s face and finished hurriedly. “Watch!”
It was not exactly the same as using an angreal, though very close. It was not meant to be done
hurriedly, either; Nynaeve did not have a soft touch, at best. Elayne felt as though she were being
shaken; nothing happened physically, but inside her head she seemed to be bouncing around, tumbling
wildly downhill. Worse, she was jostled toward embracing saidar with excruciating slowness. It
took less than a heartbeat, and seemed to take hours, days. She wanted to howl, but she could not
breathe. Abruptly, like a dam bursting, the One Power flowed through her, a rush of life and joy, of
bliss, and breath left her in a long gasp of pleasure and relief so overwhelming that her legs wobbled.
It was all she could do to keep from panting. Tottering, pulling herself up, she gave Nynaeve a stern
look, and Nynaeve shrugged apologetically. Twice in one day! The sun had to be turning green.
“I now control the flow of saidar from her as well as my own,” Nynaeve went on, not quite
meeting Elayne’s eyes, “and will until I let her go. Now, don’t fear that whoever leads the circle,”
she shot a frown at Caire and sniffed, “can make you draw too much. This really is a great deal like
a n angreal. The angreal buffers you against the extra Power, and in somewhat the same way, in a
circle you can’t be made to draw too much. In fact, in a circle you can’t draw quite as much as you
can otherwi—”
“This is dangerous!” Renaile broke in, shouldering roughly between Caire and Tebreille. Her
scowl took in Nynaeve, Elayne, and the sisters standing off from the circle as well. “You say that one
woman can simply seize another, hold her captive, use her? How long have you Aes Sedai known
this? I warn you, if you try to use it on one of us—” It was her turn to be cut off.
“It doesn’t work that way, Renaile.” Sareitha touched Garenia, and she and Kirstian leaped apart

to make room. The young Brown eyed Nynaeve uncertainly, then folded her hands and took on a
lecturing tone, as if addressing a class. With it came composure; perhaps she did see Renaile as a
pupil right then. “The Tower studied this for many years, long before the Trolloc Wars. I have read
every page that survives in the Tower Library of those studies. It was proven conclusively that one
woman cannot form a link with another against her will. It simply cannot be done; nothing happens. A
willing surrender is necessary, just as in embracing to saidar itself.” She sounded absolutely definite,
but Renaile still frowned; too many people knew how Aes Sedai could sidestep the Oath against
lying.
“And why did they study it?” Renaile demanded. “Why was the White Tower so interested in
such a thing? Perhaps you Aes Sedai still study?”
“That is ridiculous.” Exasperation dripped from Sareitha’s voice. “If you must know, it was the
problem of men who can channel that drew them to it. The Breaking of the World was a living
memory to some, then. I don’t suppose even very many sisters remember—it hasn’t been part of the
required instruction since before the Trolloc Wars—but men can be brought into a circle, too, and as
the circle doesn’t break even if you go to sleep. . . . Well, you can see the advantages. That was an
utter failure, unfortunately. More to the point here, I say again that it is impossible to force a woman
into a circle. If you doubt, try it yourself. You will see.”
Renaile nodded, accepting at last; there was very little else to do when an Aes Sedai made a
simple statement of fact. Yet Elayne wondered. What was in the pages that had not survived? She had
noticed a slight change in Sareitha’s inflection at one point. She had questions. For later, when there
were fewer ears around.
When Renaile and Sareitha withdrew, Nynaeve twitched her divided skirts straight, plainly
irritated at the interruption, and opened her mouth again.
“Continue your demonstration, Nynaeve,” Caire commanded harshly. Her dark face might have
been smooth as a frozen pond, but she was not very pleased, either.
Nynaeve’s mouth worked before she could make any sound come out, and when it did, she went
on in a rush, as though afraid someone else might break in.
The next part of the lesson was passing control of the circle. That had to be done voluntarily,
too, and even as she reached out toward Nynaeve, Elayne held her breath until she felt the subtle shift
that meant she now controlled the Power flowing into her. And that flowing through Nynaeve, of
course. She had not been sure it would work. Nynaeve could form a circle easily, if not with any
finesse, but passing guidance also involved a form of surrender; Nynaeve had considerable
difficulties relinquishing control or being brought into a circle, just as she had once had difficulty
surrendering to saidar. Which was why Elayne kept the guidance for now. It would have to be passed
to Caire, and Nynaeve might not be able to manage letting go twice. Those apologies must have been
much easier for her.
Elayne linked next with Aviendha, so Talaan could actually see how it was done with an
angreal, as much as there was to see, and it went perfectly; Aviendha was a very quick study,
blending in easily. Talaan was quick as well, it turned out, adding her still greater angreal aided
flow without a hitch. One by one, Elayne brought them in, and she herself almost shivered at the river
of the Power that streamed into her. No one yet was drawing nearly as much as she could, but it
added up, especially with angreal involved. Elayne’s awareness climbed higher with each addition
of saidar. She could smell the heavy scents in the lacework gold boxes that the Windfinders wore
around their necks, and separate one from another. She could make out each fold and crease in
everyone’s clothes as sharply as if she had her nose pressed to the cloth, more sharply. She was

aware of the faintest movement of the air against her hair and skin, caresses she never would have
noticed without the Power.
That was not the whole of her awareness, of course. The link had a certain kinship to the Warder
bond, just as intense and somehow even more intimate. She knew that a tiny blister from climbing the
hill made a spot of pain on Nynaeve’s right heel; Nynaeve always talked about good stout shoes, but
she had a weakness for slippers with a great deal of embroidery. Nynaeve wore a fixed frown,
directed at Caire, her arms were crossed, her fingers wearing the angreal played on the braid pulled
over her right shoulder, every line of her of a piece, yet inside she was a maelstrom of emotions.
Fear, worry, anticipation, irritation, wariness and impatience bounced over each other, and washing
through it all, sometimes submerging the rest, ripples of warmth and waves of heat that threatened to
burst into flame. Those last Nynaeve suppressed quickly, especially the heat, but they always
returned. Elayne almost thought she could recognize them, but it was like something glimpsed from the
corner of your eye that was gone when you turned your head.
Surprisingly, Aviendha felt fear, too, but small and tightly contained, and all but swallowed by
determination. Garenia and Kirstian, shaking visibly, were nearly pure terror, so strong it was
amazing that they could even have begun to embrace the Source. What filled Reanne to overflowing
was eagerness, and no matter her skirt smoothing. As for the Atha’an Miere. . . . Even Tebreille
exuded a wary alertness, and it did not take the quick darting of Metarra’s eyes, and Rainyn’s, to
know the focus was Caire, watching them all, impatient and commanding.
Her, Elayne left to last, and it was no real surprise that she had to make four tries—four!—to
bring the woman into the circle. Caire was no better at yielding than Nynaeve. Elayne desperately
hoped the woman had been chosen for ability, not rank.
“I will now pass the circle to you,” she told the Windfinder when it finally was done. “If you
recall what I did with Ny—” Words froze momentarily in her throat as guidance of the circle was
torn from her surrender, a sensation like having a sudden burst of wind rip all of her clothes off or
yank the bones out of her. She exhaled fiercely, and if it sounded close to spitting, well, so be it.
“Good,” Caire said, rubbing her hands together. “Good.” Her attention focused on the Bowl, her
head twisting this way and that as she studied it. Well, perhaps not all her attention. Reanne started to
sit down, and without looking up, Caire snapped, “Hold your station, woman! This isn’t a fish lolly!
Stand till you’re told to move!”
Startled, Reanne jerked back to her feet, muttering under her breath, but she might as well have
ceased to exist as far as Caire was concerned. The Windfinder’s eyes remained on the flattened
crystal shape. Elayne felt resolve in her great enough to move a mountain. And something else, tiny
and quickly stamped out. Uncertainty. Uncertainty? If after all of this, the woman really did not know
what to do—
At that moment, Caire drew deeply. Saidar flooded through Elayne, almost as much as she could
hold; an unbroken ring of light blazed into being, joining the women in the circle, brighter wherever
one used an angreal, but nowhere faint. She watched closely as Caire channeled, forming a complex
weave of all Five Powers, a four-pointed star that she laid atop the Bowl with what Elayne somehow
was sure was exquisite precision. The star touched, and Elayne gasped. Once, she had channeled a
trickle into the Bowl—in Tel’aran’rhiod, to be sure, and only a reflection of the Bowl, though still a
dangerous thing to do—and that clear crystal had turned a pale blue, and the carved clouds moved.
Now, the Bowl of the Winds was blue, the bright blue of a summer sky, and fleecy white clouds
billowed across it.
The four-point star became five-pointed, the composition of the weave altered slightly, and the

Bowl was a green sea with great heaving waves. Five points became six, and it was another sky, a
different blue, darker, winter perhaps, with purple clouds heavy with rain or snow. Seven points, and
a gray-green sea raged in storm. Eight points and sky. Nine and sea, and suddenly, Elayne felt the
Bowl itself drawing saidar, a wild torrent far greater than all the circle together could manage.
The changes continued unabated inside the Bowl, sea to sky, waves to clouds, but a writhing,
braided column of saidar shot up from that flattish crystal disc, Fire and Air, Water and Earth and
Spirit, a column of intricate lace as wide as the Bowl, climbing up and up into the sky, until its top
rose out of sight. Caire continued her weaving, sweat streaming down her face; she paused seemingly
only to blink salty drops away from her eyes as she examined the images in the Bowl, then laid a new
weave. The pattern of the braiding in the thick column altered with every weave, subtly echoing what
Caire wove.
It was a very good thing she had not wanted to focus the flows for this circle, Elayne realized;
what the woman was doing required years more study than she had. Many years more. Suddenly, she
realized something else. That ever-changing lacework of saidar bent itself around something else,
something unseen that made the column solid. She swallowed, hard. The Bowl was drawing saidin as
well as saidar.
Her hope that no one else had puzzled that out vanished with one glance at the other women. Half
stared at the twisting column with a revulsion that should have been reserved for the Dark One. Fear
grew stronger among the emotions shared in her head. Some were approaching the level of Garenia
and Kirstian, and it was a wonder those two had not fainted. Nynaeve was a hair from sicking up, for
all her suddenly too smooth face. Aviendha appeared just as calm outwardly, but inside, that tiny fear
quivered and pulsed, trying to grow.
From Caire came only determination, as steely hard as her expression. Nothing was going to
stand in Caire’s way, certainly not the mere presence of Shadow-tainted saidin mixed into her
weaving. Nothing was going to stop her. She worked the flows, and abruptly spiderwebs of saidar
blossomed from the unseen top of the column, like uneven spokes of a wheel, almost a solid fan to the
south, sparser fans reaching north and northwest, single lacy spokes stretching in other directions.
They changed as they grew, never the same from one moment to the next, spreading across the sky,
farther and farther, until the ends of the pattern also passed out of sight. Not just saidar there either,
Elayne was certain; in places that spiderweb caught and curved around something she could not see.
Still Caire wove, and the column danced to her bidding, saidar and saidin together, and the
spiderweb altered and flowed like a lopsided kaleidoscope spinning across the heavens, vanishing
into the distance, on and on and on.
Without warning, Caire straightened, knuckling her back, and released the Source completely.
Column and spiderweb evaporated, and she collapsed as much as sat down, breathing hard. The
Bowl turned clear again, but small patches of saidar flashed and crackled around its edges. “It is
done, the Light willing,” she said tiredly.
Elayne hardly heard. That was not the way to end a circle. When Caire let go in that way, the
Power disappeared from every woman simultaneously. Elayne’s eyes popped. For one instant, it was
as though she stood atop the highest tower in the world, and suddenly the tower was not there
anymore! Just an instant, yet hardly pleasant. She felt tired, if not anywhere near what she would have
had she actually done anything beyond serve as a conduit, but what she felt most was loss. Letting go
of saidar was bad enough; having it simply vanish out of you went beyond thinking about.
Others had suffered far worse than she. As the glow joining the circle winked out, Nynaeve sat
down right where she stood as though her legs had melted, sat stroking the bracelet-and-rings, staring

at it and panting. Sweat rolled down her face. “I feel like a kitchen sieve that just had the whole mill
poured through it,” she murmured. Carrying that much of the Power had its cost even if you did
nothing, even with an angreal.
Talaan wavered, a reed in the wind, casting surreptitious glances at her mother, plainly afraid to
sit. Aviendha stood straight, her fixed expression saying that willpower had as much to do with that
as anything else. She gave a slight smile, though, and made a gesture in Maiden handtalk—worth the
price—and then another—more—right behind. More than worth the price. Everyone looked weary, if
not so much as those who had used angreal. The Bowl of the Winds went quiet at last, just a wide
bowl of clear crystal, but decorated now with towering waves. Saidar still seemed to be there,
though, not being wielded by anyone, not visible, but in dimly felt flashes like those that had played
around the Bowl at the end.
Nynaeve raised her head to glower at the cloudless sky, then lowered her gaze to Caire. “All
that, for what? Did we do anything, or not?” A breath of air stirred across the hilltop, warm as the air
in a kitchen.
The Windfinder struggled to her feet. “Do you think Weaving the Winds is like throwing the
helm over on a darter?” she demanded contemptuously. “I just moved the rudder on a skimmer with a
beam as broad as the world! He will take time to turn, time to know he is supposed to turn. That he
must turn. But when he does, not the Father of Storms himself will be able to stand in his way. I have
done it, Aes Sedai, and the Bowl of the Winds is ours!”
Renaile moved into the circle, kneeling beside the Bowl. Carefully she began folding the white
silk around it. “I will take this to the Mistress of the Ships,” she said to Nynaeve. “We have fulfilled
our part of the bargain. Now, you Aes Sedai must fulfill the rest of yours.” Merilille made a sound in
her throat, but when Elayne glanced at her, the Gray appeared a study in composure.
“Maybe you’ve done your part,” Nynaeve said, rising unsteadily. “Maybe. We’ll see when this .
. . this skimmer of yours turns. If it turns!” Renaile stared hard at her across the Bowl, but Nynaeve
ignored her. “Strange,” she muttered, rubbing her temple. The bracelet-and-rings caught in her hair,
and she grimaced. “I can almost feel an echo of saidar. It must be this thing!”
“No,” Elayne said slowly. “I can feel it, too.” Not just the dimly perceived crackling in the air,
and not an echo, exactly. More the shadow of an echo, so faint that it was as if she were feeling
someone use saidar at a. . . . She turned. On the horizon to the south, lightning flashed, dozens of bolts
vivid silver-blue against the afternoon sky. Very near to Ebou Dar.
“A rainstorm?” Sareitha said eagerly. “The weather must be righting itself already.” But there
were no clouds in the sky even where the lightning forked and fell. Sareitha was not strong enough to
sense saidar being wielded at that distance.
Elayne shivered. She was not strong enough. Unless someone was using as much as they had on
this hilltop. Fifty or even a hundred Aes Sedai, all channeling at once. Or. . . . “Not one of the
Forsaken,” she murmured. Someone behind her moaned.
“One couldn’t do that,” Nynaeve agreed quietly. “Maybe they didn’t feel us the way we do them,
maybe, but they’ll have seen, unless they’re all blind. The Light burn our luck!” Quiet or not, she was
agitated; she often called Elayne down for using language like that. “Take everyone who will go to
Andor with you, Elayne. I’ll. . . . I’ll meet you there. Mat’s in the city. I have to go back for him. Burn
the boy; he came for me, and I have to.”
Elayne wrapped her arms around herself and drew a deep breath. Queen Tylin she left to the
mercies of the Light; Tylin would survive if it was possible. But Mat Cauthon, her very strange, very
instructive subject; her most unlikely rescuer. He had come for her, too, and offered more. And Thom

Merrilin; dear Thom, who she sometimes still wished would turn out to be her real father, and the
Light burn what that would make of her mother. And the boy, Olver, and Chel Vanin, and. . . . She had
to think like a queen. The Rose Crown is heavier than a mountain, her mother had told her, and duty
will make you weep, but you must bear and do what must be done.
“No,” she said, then more firmly, “No. Look at you, Nynaeve; you can hardly stand. Even if we
all went, what could we do? How many of the Forsaken are there? We’d die, or worse, for no gain.
The Forsaken have no reason to look for Mat or the others. It’s us they will be after.”
Nynaeve gaped at her, stubborn Nynaeve with sweat running down her face and her legs
unsteady. Wonderful, gallant, foolish Nynaeve. “You’re saying leave him, Elayne? Aviendha, talk to
her. Tell her about that honor you’re always going on about!”
Aviendha hesitated, then shook her head. She was almost as sweaty as Nynaeve, and from the
way she moved, just as tired. “There are times to fight without hope, Nynaeve, but Elayne is right.
The Shadowsouled will not be looking for Mat Cauthon; they will be after us, and the Bowl. He may
have left the city already. If we go, we risk giving them what can undo what we have done. Wherever
we send the Bowl, they will be able to make us tell them who we sent it with and where.”
Nynaeve’s face crumpled in pain. Elayne reached to put her arms around her.
“Shadowspawn!” someone screamed, and suddenly women were embracing saidar all over the
hilltop. Balls of fire shot up from Merilille’s hands, from Careane’s and Sareitha’s, as fast as they
could throw. A huge winged shape enveloped in flame tumbled out of the sky trailing oily black
smoke, falling just beyond the cliff.
“There’s another one!” Kirstian shouted, pointing. A second winged creature dove away from
the hill, body as big as a horse, ribbed wings spanning thirty paces or more, long neck stretched out
before and longer tail streaming behind. Two figures crouched low on its back. A storm of fire rained
after it, quickest of all from Aviendha and the Sea Folk, who made no throwing gesture as part of
their weaving. A hail of fire so thick it seemed that Fire must be forming itself out of the air, and the
thing dodged behind the hill on the other side of the farm and appeared to vanish.
“Did we kill it?” Sareitha asked. Her eyes shone bright, and she breathed hard in agitation.
“Did we even hit it?” one of the Atha’an Miere growled disgustedly.
“Shadowspawn,” Merilille murmured in amazement. “Here! At least that proves it’s the
Forsaken in Ebou Dar.”
“Not Shadowspawn,” Elayne said hollowly. Nynaeve’s face was a picture of anguish; she knew,
too. “They call it a raken. It’s the Seanchan. We must go, Nynaeve, and take every woman at the farm
with us. Whether we killed that thing or not, more will come. Anyone we leave behind will be
wearing a damane leash by tomorrow morning.” Nynaeve nodded, slowly, painfully; Elayne thought
she murmured, “Oh, Mat.”
Renaile strode up with the Bowl in her arms, once more swathed in its white covering. “Some of
our ships have encountered these Seanchan. If they are in Ebou Dar, then the ships beat to sea. My
ship fights for his life, and I am not on his deck! We go now!” And she formed the weave for a
gateway, right there.
It tangled uselessly, of course, flared bright for an instant then collapsed into nothing, but Elayne
squeaked in spite of herself. Right there in the middle of them! “You aren’t going anywhere from here
unless you mean to stay long enough to learn this hilltop!” she snapped. She hoped none of the women
who had been in the circle tried the weave; holding saidar was the fastest way to learn a place. She
could have made it work here, and very likely so could they. “You aren’t going to a moving ship from
anywhere; I don’t think it’s even possible!” Merilille nodded, though that meant little; Aes Sedai

believed a great many things to be true, and some of them actually were. As well if the Sea Folk
believed it proven, in any case. Nynaeve, haggard and staring, was in no condition to do any leading
at the moment, so Elayne went on. She hoped she managed to do her mother’s memory proud. “But
most of all, you aren’t going anywhere except with us, because our bargain isn’t complete; the Bowl
of the Winds is not yours until the weather is right.” Not precisely true unless you twisted the words
of the bargain a little, and Renaile opened her mouth, but Elayne plowed on. “And because you made
a bargain with Matrim Cauthon, my subject. You go voluntarily where I want you to, or you go tied to
a packsaddle. Those were the choices you accepted. So, get down this hill now, Renaile din Calon
Blue Star, before the Seanchan sweep down on us with an army and a few hundred women who can
channel and would like nothing better than to see us collared alongside them. Now! Run!”
To her astonishment, they ran.

Threads

E layne ran, too, of course, holding her skirts up, and quickly took the lead on the well-worn
dirt path. Only Aviendha stayed close, though she seemed to have no idea how to run in a dress,
divided or not; tired as she was, she certainly would have passed Elayne otherwise. Everyone
else strung out behind them along the narrow, winding track. None of the Atha’an Miere would
push by Renaile, and despite her silk trousers she could not move very fast carrying the Bowl
hugged to her chest. Nynaeve had no such compunctions, elbowing past and running hard,
shouting for people to get out of her way when she stumbled into them whether they were
Windfinders, Kinswomen, or Aes Sedai.
Bounding down the hillside, tripping and catching herself, Elayne wanted to laugh despite the
urgency. Despite the danger. Lini and her mother had been death on running and climbing trees from
the time she was twelve, but it was not just the sheer pleasure of running again that made delight
bubble up in her middle. She had behaved as a queen was supposed to behave, and it had worked
exactly as it was supposed to! She had taken charge, to lead people out of danger, and they followed!
Her whole life had been training for this. It was satisfaction that made her laugh, and the hot glow of
pride seemed about to burst through her skin like the radiance of saidar.
Rounding the last curve, she pounded down the final straight beside one of the tall whiteplastered barns. And her toe caught an almost buried stone. She pitched forward heavily, windmilling
her arms, and suddenly she was somersaulting head-over-heels through the air. No time even to yell.
With a thump that jarred her teeth and took all the wind out of her, she landed hard at the foot of the
path, sitting right in front of Birgitte. For an instant she could not even think, and when she could, little
satisfaction remained. So much for queenly dignity. Brushing her hair out of her face, she tried to
catch her breath as she waited for Birgitte’s cutting comment. This was a chance for the other woman
to play the older and wiser sister with a vengeance, and she seldom let an opportunity pass.
To Elayne’s surprise, Birgitte heaved her to her feet even before Aviendha could reach her, and
without so much as the faint grin on Aviendha’s face. All Elayne could feel from her Warder was a
sense of . . . focus; she thought an arrow nocked on a drawn bowstring might feel that way. “Do we
run or fight?” Birgitte asked. “I recognized those Seanchan fliers from Falme, and truth for true, I

suggest running. My bow is the ordinary sort, today.” Aviendha gave her a slight frown, and Elayne
sighed; Birgitte had to learn to guard her tongue if she really intended to hide who she was.
“Of course we run,” Nynaeve panted, laboring down the final stretch of path. “Fight or run! Fool
question! Do you think we’re utter—? Light! What are they doing?” Her voice started climbing and
kept right on. “Alise! Alise, where are you? Alise! Alise!”
With a start, Elayne realized the farm was boiling as badly as it had when Careane’s face was
recognized. Maybe worse. A hundred and forty-seven Kinswomen inhabited the place at present,
Alise had reported, including fifty-four red-belted Wise Women sent out days ago and a number of
others who had been passing through the city; now it looked as though every last one was running
somewhere, and a good many of the other women, too. Most of the Tarasin Palace servants in their
green-and-white livery dashed this way and that carrying burdens. Ducks and chickens darted through
the tumult, flapping and squawking, adding to the apparent confusion. Elayne even saw a Warder,
Vandene’s grizzled Jaem, trot by with his wiry arms wrapped around a big jute sack!
Alise appeared as though from the air, poised and collected despite the perspiration on her face.
Every strand of her hair was in place, and her dress looked as if she were merely out for a stroll.
“There’s no need to screech,” she said calmly, planting hands on hips. “Birgitte told me what those
big birds are, and I thought we might be leaving sooner rather than later, especially with all of you
galloping down the hill like the Dark One himself was after you. I told everybody to collect one clean
dress apiece, three changes of shift and stockings, soap, mending baskets, and all the coin they have.
That, and no more. The last ten to finish will do the washing-up till we get where we’re going; that
will speed their feet. I told those servants to gather all the food they could, too, just in case. And your
Warders. Sensible fellows, most of them. Surprisingly sensible, for men. Does being a Warder do
something to them?”
Nynaeve stood there with her jaw hanging, ready to issue orders and none left to give. Emotions
played across her face too fast to catch. “Very good,” she mumbled finally. And sourly. Suddenly she
brightened. “The women who aren’t Kin. Yes! They have to be—”
“Calm yourself,” Alise broke in, making a soothing gesture. “They are already gone, for the most
part. Mainly those with husbands or families they’re worried about. I couldn’t have held those back
had I wanted. But a good thirty think those birds really are Shadowspawn, and want to stay as close
to Aes Sedai as they can get.” A sharp sniff said what she thought of that. “Now, you just gather
yourself. Drink some cool water; not too fast. Put a little on your face. I have to keep an eye on
things.” Casting her eye over the bustle, everybody running in bounds, Alise shook her head. “Some
would slack off if Trollocs were coming over the hill, and most of the noblewomen never really do
get used to our rules. For sure, I’ll need to remind two or three before we go.” With that, she waded
serenely back into the turmoil of the farmyard and left Nynaeve gaping.
“Well,” Elayne said, brushing her skirt, “you did say she was a very capable woman.”
“I never said that,” Nynaeve snapped. “I never said ‘very’ Hmmph! Where did my hat get to?
Thinks she knows everything. I’ll wager she doesn’t know that!” She flounced off in a different
direction than Alise.
Elayne stared after her. Her hat? She would have liked to know where her own hat had gone to
—it was a beautiful thing—but really! Maybe being in a circle working that much of the Power, using
an angreal doing it, had unsettled Nynaeve’s wits temporarily. She still felt a trifle odd, herself, as
though she could pluck little bits of saidar out of the air around her. In any case, she had other matters
to worry about right then. Like being ready to get away before the Seanchan descended. From what
she had seen in Falme, they really might bring a hundred damane, or more, and based on the little

Egwene would let herself say of her captivity, most of those women really would be eager to help
collar others. She said that what had turned her stomach most had been the sight of damane from
Seanchan laughing with their sul’dam, fawning and playing with them, well-trained hounds with their
affectionate handlers. Egwene said some of the women collared in Falme had been that way, too. It
made Elayne’s blood run cold. She would die before letting them put that leash on her! And she
would as soon let the Forsaken have what she had found as the Seanchan. She went running to the
cistern, Aviendha at her side breathing almost as hard as she was herself.
It seemed Alise really had thought of everything, though. The ter’angreal were already stowed
away on the packhorses. The unsearched panniers remained full of jumbled odds and ends and the
Light knew what, but those she and Aviendha had emptied now bulged with coarse sacks of flour and
salt, beans and lentils. A handful of stablefolk minded the packanimals instead of running about with
their arms full. Doing Alise’s bidding, no doubt. Even Birgitte went trotting off at the woman’s call
with no more than a rueful grin!
Elayne lifted canvas covers to examine the ter’angreal as well as she could without unloading
them again. Everything appeared to be there, a bit tumbled together in two panniers, not enough to fill
them, but nothing broken. Not that anything short of the One Power itself could break most
ter’angreal, yet even so. . . .
Aviendha took a seat cross-legged on the ground, blotting sweat from her face with a large, plain
linen handkerchief that seemed very much at odds with her pretty silk riding dress. Even she was
beginning to show weariness. “What are you muttering about, Elayne? You sound like Nynaeve. This
Alise has only saved us the trouble of packing those things ourselves.”
Elayne colored faintly. She had not meant to speak aloud. “I just don’t want anyone handling
them who doesn’t know what they are doing, Aviendha.” Some ter’angreal could trigger even for
people unable to channel, if they did the wrong thing, but the truth was, she did not want anyone
handling them. They were hers! The Hall was not going to hand these over to some other sister just
because she was older and more experienced, or hide them away because studying ter’angreal was
too dangerous. With this many examples to study, maybe she could finally figure out how to make
ter’angreal that worked every time; there had been far too many failures and half-successes. “They
need someone who knows what she’s doing,” she said, lashing the stiff canvas back in place.
Order began to appear out of pandemonium more rapidly than Elayne expected, though not as
fast as she could have wished. Of course, she admitted reluctantly, nothing slower than instantaneous
could have matched her wishes. Unable to keep her eyes off the sky, she sent Careane running back to
the top of the hill to watch toward Ebou Dar. The stocky Green grumbled a bit under her breath
before curtsying, and even frowned at the Kinswomen dashing about as if on the point of suggesting
one of them instead, but Elayne wanted someone who would not faint at the sight of “Shadowspawn”
approaching, and Careane stood lowest among the sisters. Adeleas and Vandene brought out Ispan
between them, firmly shielded and the leather sack back over her head. She walked quite easily, and
nothing visible said that anything at all had been done to her, except. . . . Ispan kept her hands folded
at her waist, never so much as trying to raise the sack for a peek, and when she was boosted into a
saddle, she held out her wrists to be corded to the pommel without being told. If she was that
amenable, perhaps they had learned something from her. Elayne just did not want to contemplate how
the learning might have been achieved.
There were . . . bumps, of course, of sorts, even with what might be rushing toward them. What
surely was rushing toward them. Nynaeve getting her blue-plumed hat back was not really a bump,
though it almost turned into one; Alise had found it, and handed it back telling Nynaeve she needed to

shield her face from the sun if she wanted to keep that smooth pretty skin. An openmouthed Nynaeve
watched the graying woman hurry off to deal with one of the numerous small problems, then
ostentatiously shoved the hat under a strap of her saddlebags.
From the beginning Nynaeve set about flattening the real bumps, but Alise was nearly always
there first, and where Alise met a bump, the bump flattened itself. Several noblewomen demanded
help packing their belongings, only to be informed in no uncertain terms that she had meant what she
said and if they did not hop to it, they could live in what they stood in. They hopped. Some, and not
only nobles, changed their minds about going when they learned the destination was Andor, and were
literally chased away. Afoot, and told to keep running as long as they could. Every horse was needed,
but they had to be well away before the Seanchan appeared; at the very least they could be expected
to put anyone near the farm to the question. As should have been expected, Nynaeve got into a
shouting match with Renaile over the Bowl, and the turtle Talaan had used, which Renaile apparently
had tucked behind her sash. Hardly had they reached the stage of waving arms, however, than Alise
was right there, and in short order the Bowl was back in Sareitha’s care and the turtle in Merilille’s.
Following which, Elayne was treated to the sight of Alise shaking her finger under the astonished
nose of the Windfinder to the Mistress of the Ships to the Atha’an Miere, delivering a tongue-lashing
on the subject of theft that left Renaile spluttering indignantly. Nynaeve did a little spluttering, too,
stalking away empty-handed, yet Elayne thought she had never seen anyone look so forlorn.
All in all, it did not take very long, though. The remaining women who had been at the farm
gathered under the watchful eyes of the Knitting Circle—and of Alise, who carefully noted the last ten
to arrive, all but two in fine embroidered silks, not much different from Elayne’s. Definitely not
Kinswomen. Elayne felt sure they really would do the washing-up anyway; Alise would not let a little
thing like noble birth stand in her way. The Windfinders lined up with their horses, surprisingly silent
except for Renaile, who muttered imprecations whenever she saw Alise. Careane was summoned
back from the hilltop. The Warders brought the sisters their mounts. Almost everyone kept an eye on
the sky, and saidar made halos around all of the older Aes Sedai and most of the Windfinders.
Around a few of the Kin, as well.
Leading her mare to the head of the line, at the cistern, Nynaeve fingered the angreal still on her
hand as if she were going to be the one to make the gateway, ridiculous as the very idea might be. For
one thing, though she had washed her face—and donned her hat; strangely, all things considered—she
still tottered whenever her self-control slipped. Lan stayed practically at her shoulder, stone-faced as
always, but if ever there was a man ready to catch a woman when she fell, it was he. Even with the
bracelet-and-rings, Nynaeve might not be able to manage enough to weave a gateway. More
important, she had been dashing about the farm ever since they first arrived; Elayne had spent a
considerable time holding saidar right where they now stood. She knew that spot. Nynaeve scowled
sulkily when Elayne embraced the Source, but at least she had sense enough to say nothing.
Right from the first Elayne wished that she had asked Aviendha for the woman-cloaked-in-herown-hair; she was weary, too, and all the saidar she could draw was barely enough to form the
weave so it would work. The flows wavered in her grasp almost as if trying to twist free, then
snapped into place so suddenly that she jumped; channeling when you were tired was not at all like
other times, but this was the worst ever. At least the familiar vertical slash of silver appeared as it
should, and widened into an opening right alongside the cistern. An opening no bigger than the one
Aviendha had made, and at that, Elayne was grateful it was large enough to fit a horse through. At the
last, she had not been certain it would be. Gasps rose from the Kinswomen, seeing a view of an
upland meadow suddenly standing between them and the familiar gray bulk of the cistern.

“You should have let me try,” Nynaeve said softly. Softly, but with a sharp point even so. “You
nearly fubbed it altogether.”
Aviendha gave Nynaeve a flat look that almost made Elayne grab her arm. The longer they
remained near-sisters, the more she seemed to think she had to defend Elayne’s honor; if they did
become first-sisters, Elayne could see having to keep her away from Nynaeve, and Birgitte,
completely!
“It’s done, Nynaeve,” she said quickly. “That’s all that counts.” Nynaeve directed a flat look at
her and muttered something about the day being prickly, as if Elayne were the one showing her
snappish side.
Birgitte was the first through, grinning impudently at Lan, leading her horse with her bow
already in her other hand. Elayne could sense eagerness in her, a touch of satisfaction, perhaps that
this time she had the lead instead of Lan—there was always a bit of rivalry between Warders—and a
small measure of wariness. Very small. Elayne knew that meadow well; Gareth Bryne had taught her
to ride not far from there. About five miles over those first sparsely treed hills lay the manor house of
one of her mother’s estates. One of her estates; she had to get used to that. The seven families who
tended the house and its grounds would be the only people for half a day’s journey in any direction.
Elayne had chosen that destination because they could reach Caemlyn in two weeks from there.
And because the estate was so isolated, she might be entering Caemlyn before anyone knew she was
in Andor. That could be a very necessary precaution; at various times in Andor’s history, rivals for
the Rose Crown had been kept as “guests” until they relinquished their claims. Her mother had kept
two, until she took the throne. With luck, she could have a solid base established by the time Egwene
and the others arrived.
Lan took Mandarb right behind Birgitte’s brown gelding, and Nynaeve lurched as if to rush after
the black warhorse, then pulled herself up short with a level stare that dared Elayne to say a word.
Fiddling furiously with her reins, she made a visible effort to look anywhere except through the
gateway after Lan. Her lips moved. After a moment, Elayne realized that she was counting.
“Nynaeve,” she said quietly, “we really don’t have time for—”
“Move along,” Alise called from the rear, the sound of her hands clapping a sharp punctuating
crack. “No pushing or shoving, now, but I’ll have no laggards either! Move along.”
Nynaeve’s head swung wildly, pained indecision painting her face. For some reason she touched
her wide hat, a few of its blue plumes broken and drooping, before pulling her hand away. “Oh, that
goat-kissing old . . . !” she growled, the rest lost as she dragged her mare through the gateway. Elayne
sniffed. And Nynaeve had the nerve to speak to anybody about their language! She wished she could
have heard the rest, though; she already knew the first bit.
Alise continued her urging, but there really did not seem to be much need after the first. Even the
Windfinders hurried, glancing worriedly over their shoulders at the sky. Even Renaile, who mumbled
something about Alise that Elayne noted in the back of her head. Though calling someone “a fishloving scavenger” did seem rather mild. She would have expected the Sea Folk to eat fish all the
time.
Alise herself brought up the very rear, except for the remaining Warders, as if to herd even the
packhorses along. She paused long enough to hand Elayne her green-plumed hat. “You’ll want to keep
the sun off that sweet face of yours,” she said with a smile. “Such a pretty girl. No need to turn to
leather before your time.”
Aviendha, sitting on the ground nearby, fell over backward and kicked her heels laughing.
“I think I’ll ask her to find you a hat. With lots of plumes, and big bows,” Elayne said in dulcet

tones before quickly following the Kinswoman. That certainly cut off Aviendha’s laughter.
The gently rolling meadow was broad and nearly a mile long, surrounded by hills taller than
those she had left behind, and by trees she knew, oak and pine and blackwood, sourgum and
leatherleaf and fir, thick forest with good, tall timber to south and west and east, though there might
not be any cutting this year. Most of the more scattered trees to the north, toward the manor, were
better suited for firewood. Small gray boulders dotted the thick brown grass here and there, and not
even a withered stalk marked the death of a wildflower. That was not so different from the south.
For once Nynaeve was not peering at the surrounding countryside trying to find Lan. He and
Birgitte would not be gone long anyway, not here. Instead she strode briskly among the horses,
ordering people to mount in a loud, commanding voice, chivvying the servants with the pack animals,
curtly telling some of the Kinswomen who had no horses that any child could walk five miles,
shouting at a slender Altaran noblewoman with a scar on her cheek and carrying a bundle nearly as
big as herself that if she had been fool enough to bring all of her dresses then she could carry them.
Alise had gathered the Atha’an Miere around her and was instructing them on how to mount a horse.
For a wonder, they actually appeared to be paying attention. Nynaeve glanced her way and seemed
pleased to see Alise standing in one spot. Until Alise smiled encouragingly and motioned her to go on
with what she was doing.
For an instant Nynaeve stood stock-still, staring at the woman. Then she came striding through
the grass to Elayne. Reaching up to her hat with both hands, she hesitated, glowering up at it through
her lashes before giving it a twitch straight. “I’ll just let her take care of everything this time,” she
said in a suspiciously reasonable tone. “We’ll just see how well she does with those . . . Sea Folk.
Yes, we will.” Too reasonable a tone by half. Abruptly she frowned at the still-open gateway. “Why
are you holding it? Let go.” Aviendha was frowning, too.
Elayne drew a deep breath. She had thought about this, and there was no other way, but Nynaeve
would try to argue her out of it, and there was no time for arguing. Through the gateway, the farmyard
stood empty, even the chickens finally frightened away by the hubbub, yet how long before it filled up
again? She studied her weave, melded together so snugly that only a few threads remained distinct.
She could see every flow, of course, but except for those few, they appeared inseparably combined.
“Take everyone to the manor house, Nynaeve,” she said. The sun did not have very much farther to
fall; perhaps two hours of light remained. “Master Hornwell will be surprised at so many visitors
arriving at dark, but tell him you’re guests of the girl who cried over the redbird with the broken
wing; he’ll remember that. I will be along as soon as I can.”
“Elayne,” Aviendha began in a surprisingly anxious voice, and at the same time, Nynaeve said
sharply, “Just what do you think you’re—”
There was only one way to stop it. Elayne plucked one of the discernible threads free of the
weave; it wavered and flailed like a living tentacle; it fuzzed and spluttered, tiny fluffs of saidar
breaking off and fading away. She had not noticed that when Aviendha unmade her weave, but she
had only seen the tail of that, really. “Go on,” she told Nynaeve. “I’ll wait for the rest until you are all
out of sight.” Nynaeve stared out, her jaw hanging. “It has to be done,” Elayne sighed. “The Seanchan
will be at the farm in hours, for sure. Even if they wait until tomorrow, what if one of the damane has
the Talent to read residues? Nynaeve, I won’t give Traveling to the Seanchan. I won’t!”
Nynaeve growled something under her breath about the Seanchan that must have been
particularly pithy, judging by her tone. “Well, I won’t let you burn yourself out!” she said aloud.
“Now, put that back! Before the whole thing explodes the way Vandene said. You could kill all of
us!”

“It cannot be put back,” Aviendha said, laying a hand on Nynaeve’s arm. “She has begun, and
now she must finish. You must do as she says, Nynaeve.”
Nynaeve’s brows drew down. “Must” was a word she did not like hearing one bit, not applied
to her. She was not a fool, though, so after a bit of glaring—at Elayne, at the gateway, at Aviendha, at
the world in general—she flung her arms around Elayne in a hug that made her ribs creak.
“You be careful, you hear me,” she whispered. “If you get yourself killed, I swear I’ll skin you
alive!” In spite of everything, Elayne burst out laughing. Nynaeve snorted, pushing her out to arm’s
length by her shoulders. “You know what I mean,” she grumbled. “And don’t think I don’t mean it,
because I do! I do,” she added in a softer voice. “You take care.”
It took Nynaeve a moment to gather herself, blinking and pulling her blue riding gloves tight.
There seemed to be a hint of moisture in her eyes, though that could not have been; Nynaeve made
other people cry, she did not cry herself. “Well, then,” she said loudly. “Alise, if you don’t have
everyone ready yet—” Turning, she cut off with a strangled croak.
Those who were supposed to be mounted were, even the Atha’an Miere. The Warders were all
gathered around the other sisters; Lan and Birgitte had returned, and Birgitte watched Elayne
worriedly. The servants had the pack animals in a line, and the Kinswomen were waiting patiently,
most afoot except for the Knitting Circle. A number of horses that could have been used for riding
were loaded with sacks of food and bundles of belongings. Women who had brought more than Alise
allowed—none of them Kin—carried their bundles on their own backs. The slender noble with the
scar was bent at an awkward angle beneath hers, and glaring at anyone but Alise. Every woman who
could channel was staring at the gateway. And every woman who had been there to hear Vandene tell
of the dangers watched that one whipping filament as she would have a red adder.
It was Alise herself who brought Nynaeve her horse. And straightened the blue-plumed hat as
Nynaeve put a foot in the stirrup. Nynaeve turned the plump mare north with Lan riding Mandarb at
her side and a look of utter mortification on her face. Why she did not just set Alise down, Elayne did
not understand. To hear Nynaeve tell it, she had been putting women older than herself in their place
since she was little more than a girl. And she was Aes Sedai, now, after all; that should carry
mountains of weight with any Kinswoman.
As the column began to wend its way toward the hills, Elayne looked at Aviendha and Birgitte.
Aviendha simply stood there with her arms folded beneath her breasts; she had the woman-wrappedin-her-own-hair angreal clutched in one hand. Birgitte took Lioness’s reins from Elayne, adding them
to those of her own horse and Aviendha’s, then walked over to a small boulder twenty paces away
and sat down.
“You two must,” Elayne began, then coughed when Aviendha’s eyebrows shot up in surprise.
Sending Aviendha out of danger was impossible without shaming her. Perhaps impossible altogether.
“I want you to go with the others,” she told Birgitte. “And take Lioness. Aviendha and I can take turns
riding her gelding. I’d like a walk before bedtime.”
“If you ever treat a man half as well as you do that horse,” Birgitte said dryly, “he’ll be yours for
life. I think I’ll just sit awhile; I’ve ridden long enough today. I’m not at your beck and call all the
time. We can play that game in front of the sisters and the other Warders, to spare your blushes, but
you and I know better.” Despite the mocking words, what Elayne felt from her was affection. No;
stronger than affection. Her own eyes stung suddenly. Her death would hurt Birgitte to the bone—the
Warder bond made that certain—but it was friendship that made her stay now.
“I am thankful to have two friends such as you,” she said simply. Birgitte grinned at her as if she
had said something silly.

Aviendha, however, blushed furiously and stared at Birgitte, wide-eyed and flustered, as though
the Warder’s presence were to blame for her fiery cheeks. Hurriedly she shifted her gaze to the
people still short of the first hill, perhaps half a mile distant. “Best to wait until they are out of sight,”
she said, “but you cannot wait too long. Once you have started the unweaving, the flows begin to
grow . . . slick . . . after a time. Letting one slip free before it is out of the weave is the same as letting
go of the weave; it will fall into whatever it wishes, then. But you must not hurry, either. Each thread
must be pulled free as far as it will go. The more that come loose, the easier others will be to see, but
you must always pick the thread that is easiest to see.” Smiling warmly, she pressed her fingers firmly
against Elayne’s cheek. “You will do well, if you are careful.”
It did not sound that difficult. She just had to be careful. It seemed to take a long time for the last
woman to vanish over the hill, the slender noble bent under the bulk of her dresses. The sun barely
appeared to settle any at all, but it seemed like hours. What did Aviendha mean precisely by “slick”?
She could not explain beyond variations on the word; they became difficult to hold, that was all.
Elayne found out as soon as she began again. “Slick” was what you would get if you coated a
live eel with grease. She gritted her teeth just holding on to that first thread, and that was on top of
trying to pull it free. All that stopped her from gasping in relief when the thread of Air began
whipping about, finally loose, was that there were more to go. If they became much more “slick,” she
was not sure she could manage it. Aviendha watched closely, but did not say another word, though
she always had an encouraging smile when Elayne needed one. Elayne could not see Birgitte—she
did not dare look away from her work—yet she could feel her, a small knot of rock-solid confidence
in her own head, enough confidence to fill her.
Sweat slid down her face, down her back and belly, until she began to feel “slick” herself. A
bath tonight would be most welcome. No, she could not think of that. All attention on the weaves.
They were getting harder to handle, quivering in her grip as soon as she touched one, but they still
came free, and every time one thread began to lash about, another seemed to leap out of the mass, to
suddenly be clearly perceptible where there had only been solid saidar before. To her eye the
gateway resembled some monstrous, distorted hundred-heads on the bottom of a pond, surrounded by
flailing tendrils, every one thickly haired with threads of the Power that grew and writhed and
vanished only to be replaced by new. The opening visible to anyone flexed along its edges, changing
shape and even size continuously. Her legs began to tremble; strain stung her eyes as much as sweat
did. She did not know how much longer she could go on. Gritting her teeth, she fought. One thread at a
time. One thread at a time.
A thousand miles away, less than a hundred paces away through the shuddering gateway, dozens
of soldiers swept around the white farm buildings, short men carrying crossbows, in brown
breastplates and painted helmets that looked like the heads of huge insects. Behind them came a
woman with red panels bearing silver lightning on her skirts, a bracelet on her wrist linked by a
silvery leash to the collar around the neck of a woman in gray, and then another sul’dam and her
damane, then another pair. One of the sul’dam pointed at the gateway, and the glow of saidar
abruptly enveloped her damane.
“Get down!” Elayne screamed, falling backward, out of sight of the farmyard, and silver-blue
lightning shot through the gateway with a roar that filled her ears, forking savagely in every direction.
Her hair lifted, every strand trying to stand on its own, and thunderous fountains of earth erupted
wherever one of the forks struck. Dirt and pebbles rained down on her.
Hearing returned suddenly, and a man’s voice from the other side of the opening, a slurred,
drawling accent that made her skin crawl as much as the words. “. . . must take them alive, you

fools!”
Abruptly one of the soldiers was leaping into the meadow right in front of her. Birgitte’s arrow
punched through the clenched fist embossed on his leather breastplate. A second Seanchan soldier
stumbled over the first as he fell, and Aviendha’s belt knife stabbed into his throat before he could
recover. Arrows flew from Birgitte’s bow like hail; with one boot on the horses’ reins, she grinned
grimly as she shot. The trembling horses tossed their heads and danced as if they would jerk free and
run, but Birgitte simply stood and shot as fast as she could draw. Shouts from beyond the gateway
said Birgitte Silverbow still struck home with every shaft she loosed. Answer came, quick as bad
thought, black streaks, crossbow bolts. So quick, all happening so fast. Aviendha fell, blood running
over the fingers clutching her right arm, but she let go of her wound immediately, crawling clear,
scrabbling on the ground for the angreal, her face set. Birgitte cried out; dropping her bow, she
grabbed her thigh where a quarrel stuck out. Elayne felt the stab of agony as sharply as if it were her
own.
Desperately, she seized another thread from where she lay half on her back. And realized to her
horror after one tug that it was all she could do to hold on. Had the thread moved? Had it slipped free
any at all? If it had, she did not dare let go. The thread trembled greasily in her grasp.
“Alive, I said!” that Seanchan voice roared. “Anyone who kills a woman gets no share of the
taking gold!” The flurry of crossbow bolts ceased.
“You wish to take me?” Aviendha shouted. “Then come and dance with me!” Saidar’s glow
abruptly surrounded her, dim even with the angreal, and balls of fire sprang into being in front of the
gateway and sprayed through again and again. Not very large balls, but the blasts as they burst back in
Altara sounded in a steady stream. Aviendha panted with effort, though; her face glistened with sweat.
Birgitte had recovered her bow; she looked every inch the hero of legend, blood streaming down her
leg, barely able to stand, but an arrow half drawn, searching for a target.
Elayne tried to control her breathing. She could not embrace one shred more of the Power,
nothing to help. “The two of you must get away,” she said. She could not believe how she sounded,
calm as ice; she knew she should have been wailing. Her heart was trying to pound through her ribs.
“I don’t know how much longer I can hold this.” That held true for the entire weave as much as for
that single thread. Was it sliding? Was it? “Go, as fast as you can. The other side of the hills should
be safe, but every span you can cover gains something. Go!”
Birgitte growled in the Old Tongue, but nothing that Elayne knew. It sounded like phrases she
would like to learn. If there was ever a chance. Birgitte went on in words Elayne could understand.
“You let that bloody thing go before I tell you, and you won’t have to worry about waiting for
Nynaeve to skin you; I’ll do it myself. And then let her have a turn. Just be quiet and hang on!
Aviendha, get around here—behind that thing!—can you keep that up from behind it?—get around
here and on one of these bloody horses.”
“As long as I can see where to weave,” Aviendha replied, staggering to her feet. She wobbled
sideways and barely caught herself short of falling. Blood flowed down her sleeve from a wicked
gash. “I think I can.” She vanished behind the gateway, and the fireballs continued. You could see
through a gateway from the other side, though it appeared to be a heat haze hanging in the air. You
could not walk through from that side, though—the attempt would be extremely painful—and when
Aviendha reappeared, she was stumbling well wide. Birgitte helped her mount her gelding, but
backward, of all things!
When Birgitte motioned fiercely to her, Elayne did not bother with shaking her head. For one
thing, she feared what might happen if she did. “I’m not certain I can hold on if I try to get up.” In

truth, she was not certain she could get up; tired was no longer in it; her muscles were water. “Ride
as fast as you can. I’ll hold on as long as I’m able. Please, go!”
Muttering curses in the Old Tongue—they had to be; nothing else ever had the sound!—Birgitte
shoved the horses’ reins into Aviendha’s hands. Nearly falling twice, she hobbled to Elayne and bent
to take her by the shoulders. “You can hang on,” she said, her voice filled with the same conviction
Elayne felt from her. “I never met a Queen of Andor before you, but I’ve known queens like you. A
backbone of steel and a lion’s heart. You can do it!”
Slowly she pulled Elayne up, not waiting for an answer, her face tight, every stab in her leg
echoing in Elayne’s head. Elayne quivered with the effort of holding the weave, holding that one
thread; she was surprised to find herself erect. And alive. Birgitte’s leg throbbed madly in her head.
She tried not to lean on Birgitte, but her own trembling limbs would not support her completely. As
they lurched toward the horses, each half leaning on the other, she kept looking back over her
shoulder. She could hold a weave without looking at it—she could normally—but she needed to
reassure herself that she really did still have a grip on that one thread, that it was not slipping. The
gateway now appeared like no weave she had ever seen, twisting wildly, wreathed with fuzzed
tentacles.
With a groan, Birgitte heaved her into her saddle more than helped her. Backward, just like
Aviendha! “You have to see,” she explained, limping to her gelding; holding the reins of all three
horses, she pulled herself up painfully. Without a sound, but Elayne felt the agony. “You do what
needs doing and leave where we’re going to me.” The horses leaped away, perhaps as much from
eagerness to be gone as from Birgitte’s heel in her own mount’s flank.
Elayne hung on to the high cantle of her saddle as grimly as she did to the weave, to saidar
itself. The galloping horse flung her about, and it was all she could do to remain in the saddle.
Aviendha used her saddle’s cantle as a prop to keep herself upright; her mouth hung open, sucking air,
and her eyes seemed fixed. The glow surrounded her, though, and that stream of fireballs continued.
Not as fast as before, true, and some shot wide of the gateway, streaking trails of flame through the
grass or exploding on the ground beyond, but they still formed and flew. Elayne took strength, made
herself take strength; if Aviendha could keep on when she looked ready to fall on her face, she could,
too.
At a gallop, the gateway began to dwindle, brown grass stretching out between them and the
opening, and then the ground was slanting upward. They were climbing the hill! Birgitte was again the
arrow in the bow, all focus, fighting down the agony in her legs, urging her horses for more speed. All
they had to do was reach the crest, reach the other side.
With a gasp, Aviendha sagged onto her elbows, bouncing on her saddle like a loose sack; the
light of saidar flickered around her and was gone. “I cannot,” she panted. “I cannot.” That was all she
could get out. Seanchan soldiers began leaping into the meadow almost as soon as the hail of fire
ceased.
“It’s all right,” Elayne managed. Her throat was sand; all the moisture that had been in her now
coated her skin and soaked her clothes. “Using an angreal is tiring. You did well, and they can’t
catch us now.”
As if to mock her, a sul’dam appeared in the meadow below; even at half a mile there was no
mistaking the two women. The sun, low in the west, still flashed glints off the a’dam linking them.
Another pair joined them, then a third, and a fourth. A fifth.
“The crest!” Birgitte shouted joyfully. “We made it! It’s good wine and a well set-up man
tonight!”

In the meadow, a sul’dam pointed, and time seemed to slow for Elayne. The glow of the One
Power sprang up around the woman’s damane. Elayne could see the weave forming. She knew what
it was. And there was no way to stop it. “Faster!” she shouted. The shield struck her. She should have
been too strong for it—she should have been!—but exhausted as she was, barely clinging to saidar as
she was, it sliced between her and the Source. Down in the meadow, the weave that had been a
gateway fell in on itself. Haggard, looking as though she could not possibly move, Aviendha hurled
herself from her saddle at Elayne, carrying them both off. Elayne had just time to see the far slope of
the hill below her as she fell.
The air turned white, blanking her sight. There was sound—she knew there was sound, a great
roar—but it lay beyond hearing. Something struck her, as if she had fallen from a rooftop onto hard
pavement, from a tower top.
Her eyes opened, staring at the sky. The sky looked, strange somehow, blurry. For a moment she
could not move, and when she did, she gasped. She hurt everywhere. Oh, Light, she hurt! Slowly she
raised a hand to her face; her fingers came away red. Blood. The others. She had to help the others.
She could feel Birgitte, feel pain as bad as what gripped her, but at least Birgitte was alive. And
determined, and angry apparently; she could not be injured too badly. Aviendha.
With a sob, Elayne rolled over, then pushed up to hands and knees, her head spinning, agony
stabbing her side. Vaguely she recalled that moving with even one broken rib could be dangerous, but
the thought was as hazy as the hillside. Thinking seemed . . . difficult. Blinking appeared to help her
sight, though. Some. She was almost to the bottom of the hill! High above, a haze of smoke rose from
the meadow beyond. Unimportant, now. Not important at all.
Thirty paces up the slope, Aviendha was on her hands and knees, too, almost falling over when
she raised a hand to wipe away blood that poured down her face, but searching anxiously. Her gaze
fell on Elayne, and she froze, staring. Elayne wondered how bad she looked. Surely no worse than
Aviendha herself; half of the other woman’s skirt was gone, her bodice torn nearly off, and
everywhere skin showed, there seemed to be blood.
Elayne crawled to her. With her head, it seemed much easier than trying to stand and walk. As
she came close, Aviendha gave a relieved gasp.
“You are all right,” she said, touching bloody fingers to Elayne’s cheek. “I was so afraid. So
afraid.”
Elayne blinked in surprise. What she could see of herself appeared in every bit as bad shape as
Aviendha. Her own skirts remained intact, but half of her bodice was ripped away entirely, and she
seemed to be bleeding from two dozen gashes. Then it struck her. She had not been burned out. She
shivered at the thought. “We are both all right,” she said softly.
Well off to one side, Birgitte wiped her belt knife on the mane of Aviendha’s gelding and
straightened from the still horse. Her right arm dangled, her coat was gone, along with one boot, and
the rest of her garments torn; as much blood stained her skin and clothes as either of theirs. The
crossbow bolt standing out from her thigh seemed to be the worst of her injuries, but the rest certainly
added up to as much again. “His back was broken,” she said, gesturing to the horse at her feet.
“Mine’s well, I think, but the last I saw of him, he was running fit to win the Wreath of Megairil. I
always thought he had a turn of speed. Lioness.” She shrugged, and winced. “Elayne, Lioness was
dead when I found her. I’m sorry.”
“We are alive,” Elayne said firmly, “and that is what counts.” She would weep for Lioness later.
The smoke above the hilltop was not thick, but it rose over a wide area. “I want to see exactly what it
was that I did.”

It took clinging to one another for all three of them to stand, and laboring up the hillside was an
effort of panting and groans, even from Aviendha. They sounded as though they had been thrashed
within an inch of their lives—which Elayne supposed they had been—and looked as though they had
wallowed in a butcher’s shambles. Aviendha still carried the angreal tight in her fist, but even if she
or Elayne had possessed more than their small Talent with Healing, neither could have managed to
embrace the Source, much less channel. At the top of the hill, they stood leaning on each other and
stared at devastation.
Fire ringed the meadow, but the heart of it was blackened, smoldering and swept clear even of
boulders. Half the trees on the surrounding slopes were broken or leaning away from the meadow.
Hawks began to appear, riding the hot air rising from the fire; hawks often hunted so, looking for
small animals chased into the open by the flames. Of the Seanchan there was no sign. Elayne wished
there were bodies, so she could be certain they were all dead. Especially all of the sul’dam. Gazing
down at the burned, smoking ground, though, she was suddenly glad there was no evidence. It had
been a terrible way to die. The Light have mercy on their souls, she thought. On all of their souls.
“Well,” she said aloud, “I did not do as well as you, Aviendha, but I suppose it worked out for
the best, considering. I will try to do better next time.”
Aviendha glanced at her sideways. There was a gash on her cheek, and another across her
forehead, as well as a long one laying open her scalp. “You did much better than I, for a first try. I
was given a simple knot tied in a flow of Wind the first time. It took me fifty tries to unweave even
that without having a clap of thunder in my face, or a blow that made my ears ring.”
“I suppose I should have started with something simpler,” Elayne said. “I have a habit of leaping
in over my head.” Over her head? She had leaped before looking to see whether there was water! She
stifled a chuckle, but not before it sent a stab through her side. So instead of chuckling, she moaned
through her teeth. She thought some of them might be loose. “At least we’ve found a new weapon.
Perhaps I should not be happy about that, but with the Seanchan back again, I am.”
“You do not understand, Elayne.” Aviendha gestured toward the center of the meadow, where
the gateway had been. “That could have been no more than a flash of light, or even less. You cannot
tell until it happens. Is a flash of light worth the risk of burning out yourself and every woman closer
to you than a hundred paces or more?”
Elayne stared at her. She had stayed, knowing that? To risk your life was one thing, but to risk
losing the ability to channel. . . . “I want us to adopt each other as first-sisters, Aviendha. As soon as
we can find Wise Ones.” What they were to do about Rand, she could not imagine. The very idea that
they would both marry him—and Min, too!—was worse than ridiculous. But of this, she was sure. “I
don’t need to know any more about you. I want to be your sister.” Gently, she kissed Aviendha’s
blood-stained cheek.
She had only thought Aviendha blushed fiercely before. Even Aiel lovers did not kiss where
anyone could see. Fiery sunsets paled beside Aviendha’s face. “I want you for my sister, too,” she
mumbled. Swallowing hard—and eyeing Birgitte, who was pretending to ignore them—she leaned
over and quickly pressed her lips to Elayne’s cheek. Elayne loved her as much for that gesture as for
the rest.
Birgitte had been gazing behind them, over her shoulder, and perhaps she had not been
pretending after all, because she suddenly said, “Someone’s coming. Lan and Nynaeve, unless I miss
my guess.”
Awkwardly, they turned, hobbling and stumbling and groaning. It seemed quite ludicrous; heroes
in stories never got hurt so they could barely stand. In the distance to the north, two riders appeared

briefly through the trees. Briefly, but long enough to make out a tall man on a tall horse, galloping
hard, and a woman on a shorter animal running just as hard at his side. Gingerly, the three of them sat
down to wait. That was another thing heroes in stories never did, Elayne thought with a sigh. She
hoped she could be a queen to make her mother proud, but it was clear that she would never make a
hero.
Chulein moved the reins slightly, and Segani banked smoothly, turning on a ribbed wing. He was
a well-trained raken, swift and agile, her favorite, though she had to share flying him. There were
always more morat’raken than raken; a fact of life. Down in the farm below, balls of fire were
leaping out of the air apparently, scattering in every direction. She tried to pay no attention; her job
was to watch for trouble approaching from the area around the farm. At least the smoke had stopped
rising from where Tauan and Macu had died in the olive grove.
A thousand paces above the ground, she had a very long view. All the other raken were off
scouting the countryside; any woman who ran would be marked for checking, to see whether she was
one of those who had caused all the excitement, though truth for sure, anyone in these lands who saw a
raken in the air likely would run. All Chulein had to do was watch for approaching trouble here. She
wished she did not feel an itch between her shoulder blades; it always meant trouble was on the way.
The wind of Segani’s flight was not bad at this speed, but she drew the drawstring of her waxed linen
hood tighter under her chin, tested the leather safety straps that held her in the saddle, adjusted her
crystal goggles, snugged her gauntlets.
Over a hundred Fists of Heaven were on the ground already, and more important, six sul’dam
with damane and another dozen carrying shoulder bags full of spare a’dam. The second flight would
be lifting from the hills to the south with reinforcements. Better if more had come in the first strike,
but there were few enough to’raken with the Hailene, and strong rumor had it that many of those had
been given the task of ferrying the High Lady Suroth and her entire entourage down from Amadicia.
Bad to think ill of the Blood, yet she wished more to’raken had been sent to Ebou Dar. No
morat’raken could think well of the huge, ungainly to’raken, fit only to carry burdens, but they could
have put more Fists of Heaven on the ground faster, more sul’dam.
“Rumor says there are hundreds of marath’damane down there,” Eliya said loudly against her
back. In the sky, you had to speak loudly, over the rush of wind. “Do you know what I’m going to do
with my share of the taking gold? Buy an inn. This Ebou Dar looks a likely place, what I saw of it.
Maybe I’ll even find a husband. Have children. What do you think of that?”
Chulein grinned behind her wind-scarf. Every flier talked of buying an inn—or a tavern,
sometimes a farm—yet who could leave the sky? She patted the base of Segani’s long, leathery neck.
Every woman flier—three in four were women—talked of a husband and children, but children meant
an end to flying, too. More women left the Fists of Heaven in a month than left the sky in half a year.
“I think you should keep your eyes open,” she said. But there was no harm in a little talk. She
could have seen a child move in the olive groves below, much more anything that might threaten Fists
of Heaven. The most lightly armored of soldiers, they were about as hard as the Deathwatch Guard;
some said harder. “I’ll use my share to buy a damane and hire a sul’dam.” If there were half as many
marath’damane down there as rumor claimed, her share would buy two damane. Three! “A damane
trained to make Sky Lights. When I leave the sky, I’ll be as rich as one of the Blood.” They had
something called “fireworks” here—she had seen some fellows vainly trying to interest the Blood in
Tanchico—but who would watch such a pitiful thing compared to the Sky Lights? Those fellows had
been bundled out and dumped in the road outside the city.
“The farm!” Eliya shouted, and suddenly something hit Segani hard, harder than the worst storm

gust Chulein had ever felt, tumbling him wing over wing.
Down the raken plunged, screaming his raucous cry, spinning so fast that Chulein was pulled
tight against her safety straps. She left her hands on her thighs, tensed on the reins but still. Segani had
to pull out of this himself; any twitch on the reins would only hinder him. Rolling like a gambling
wheel, they fell. Morat’raken were taught not to watch the ground if a raken fell, whatever the
reason, but she could not help estimating her height every time a whiplike tumble brought the ground
into sight. Eight hundred paces. Six hundred. Four. Two. The Light illumine her soul, and the infinite
mercy of the Creator protect her from—
With a snap of his broad wings that jerked her sideways and rattled her teeth, Segani leveled
out, the tips of his pinions brushing treetops as they swept down. With a calmness born of hard
training, she checked the motion of his wings for strain. Nothing, but she would have a
der’morat’raken examine him thoroughly anyway. A tiny thing that might slip by her eyes would not
escape a master.
“It seems we’ve escaped the Lady of the Shadows one more time, Eliya.” Turning to look over
her shoulder, she let her words trail off. A length of broken safety strap trailed back from the empty
seat behind her. Every flier knew that the Lady waited at the bottom of the long fall, but knowing
never made seeing easier.
Offering a quick prayer for the dead, she firmly pushed herself back to duty and urged Segani to
climb. A slow, spiraling climb, in case of some hidden strain, but as quick as she thought safe. Maybe
a little quicker than safe. Smoke rising from beyond the knobby hill ahead made her frown, but what
she saw as she cleared the crest dried her mouth. Her hands stilled on the reins, and Segani continued
to climb on powerful sweeps of his wings.
The farm was . . . gone. Foundations scoured clean of the white buildings that had stood on them,
the big structures built into a hillside smashed heaps of rubble. Gone. Everything was blackened and
burned. Fire raged through the undergrowth on the slopes and made fans a hundred paces long into the
olive groves and the forest, stretching from the spaces between the hills. Beyond lay broken trees for
another hundred or more, all leaning away from the farm. She had never seen anything like it. Nothing
could be alive down there. Nothing could have lived through that. Whatever it had been.
Quickly she came to herself and turned Segani south. In the distance she could make out
to’raken, each one crowded with a dozen Fists of Heaven over this short distance, Fists of Heaven
and sul’dam, coming too late. She began composing her report in her head; there was certainly no one
else to make one. Everyone said this was a land full of marath’damane waiting to be collared, but
with this new weapon, these women who called themselves Aes Sedai were a true danger. Something
had to be done about them, something decisive. Perhaps, if the High Lady Suroth was on her way to
Ebou Dar, she would see the need, too.

CHAPTER
7

A Goatpen

T

he Ghealdanin sky was cloudless, the forested hills hammered by a fierce morning sun.
Even short of midday, the land sweltered. Pines and leatherleaf were yellowing in the drought,
and others Perrin suspected also were evergreens. Not a whisper of air stirred. Sweat dripped
down his face, ran into his short beard. His curly hair was matting on his head. He thought he
heard thunder somewhere to the west, but he had almost stopped believing it would ever rain
again. You hammered the iron that lay on your anvil instead of daydreaming about working
silver.
From the vantage of his sparsely treed ridge, he studied the walled town of Bethal through a
brass-bound looking glass. Even his eyes could use help over this distance. It was a good-sized town
of slate-roofed buildings, with half a dozen tall stone structures that might have been minor nobles’
palaces or the homes of well-to-do merchants. He could not make out the scarlet banner hanging
limply atop the tallest tower of the largest palace, the only flag in sight, but he knew who it belonged
to. Alliandre Maritha Kigarin, Queen of Ghealdan, far from her capital in Jehannah.
The town gates stood open, with a good twenty guards at each, yet no one came out, and the
roads he could see were empty except for a lone rider galloping hard toward Bethal from the north.
The soldiers were on edge, some shifting pikes or bows at sight of the horseman as though he waved
a blood-dripping sword. More soldiers on watch crowded the wall towers or marched the walls
between. Plenty of nocked arrows up there, too, and raised crossbows. Plenty of fear.
A storm had swept over this part of Ghealdan. It still did. The Prophet’s bands created chaos,
bandits took advantage, and Whitecloaks raiding across the border from Amadicia might easily strike
this far. A few scattered columns of smoke farther south probably marked burning farms, Whitecloak
work or the Prophet’s. Bandits seldom bothered with burning, and the other two left little for them in
any case. Adding to the jumble, rumor in every village he had passed the last few days said that
Amador had fallen, to the Prophet or Taraboners or Aes Sedai, depending on who told the tale. Some
claimed Pedron Niall himself was dead in the fighting to defend the city. All in all, reason enough for
a queen to be concerned for her own safety. Or the soldiers could be down there because of him.
Despite his best efforts, his passage south had hardly gone unnoticed.
He scratched his beard, considering. A pity the wolves in the surrounding hills could not tell him

anything, but they seldom paid heed to men’s doings except to stay clear of them. And since Dumai’s
Wells he had not felt right in asking any more of them than he absolutely had to. It might be best after
all if he rode in alone, with just a few of the Two Rivers men.
He often thought Faile could read his mind, usually when he least wanted her to, and she proved
it now, heeling her night-black mare Swallow close to his dun. Her narrow-skirted riding dress was
nearly as dark as the mare, yet she seemed to be taking the heat better than he. She smelled faintly of
herbal soap and clean perspiration, of herself. Of determination. Her tilted eyes were very
determined, and with her bold nose, she was very much her namesake falcon.
“I would not like to see holes in that fine blue coat, husband,” she said softly, for his ears alone,
“and those fellows look as if they might just shoot at a group of strange men before asking who they
are. Besides, how will you reach Alliandre without announcing your name to the world? This must be
done quietly, remember.” She did not say that she should be the one to go, that the gate guards would
take a woman alone for a refugee from the troubles, that she could reach the Queen using her mother’s
name without exciting too much comment, but she did not need to. He had had all that and more from
her every night since entering Ghealdan. He was here in part because of Alliandre’s cautious letter to
Rand, offering. . . . Support? Allegiance? Her desire for secrecy had been paramount, in any case.
Perrin doubted that even Aram, sitting his leggy gray a few paces behind them, could have heard
a word Faile said, yet before she finished speaking, Berelain brought her white mare up on his other
side, sweat glistening on her cheeks. She also smelled determined, through a cloud of rose perfume.
To him, it seemed a cloud. For a wonder, her green riding dress showed no more flesh than it had to.
Berelain’s two companions stayed back, though Annoura, her Aes Sedai advisor, studied him
with an unreadable expression from beneath her cap of thin shoulder-long beaded braids. Not him and
the two women at his sides; him in particular. No sweat there. He wished he were close enough to
smell the beak-nosed Gray sister; unlike the other Aes Sedai, she had made no promises to anyone.
For whatever those promises were worth. Lord Gallenne, commander of Berelain’s Winged Guards,
was seemingly busy examining Bethal through a looking glass raised to his one eye, and fiddling with
his reins in a way Perrin had come to know meant that he was deep in calculations. Probably how to
take Bethal by force; Gallenne always saw the worst possibility first.
“I still think I should be the one to approach Alliandre,” Berelain said. This, too, Perrin had
heard every day. “It is why I came, after all.” That was one of the reasons. “Annoura will be granted
an audience at once, and take me in with none the wiser save Alliandre.” A second wonder. There
had not been a hint of flirtation in her voice. She seemed to be paying as much attention to smoothing
her red leather gloves as to him.
Which one? The trouble was, he did not want to choose either.
Seonid, the second Aes Sedai who had come to the ridgeline, stood beside her bay gelding a
little way off, near a tall drought-withered blackwood, looking not at Bethal but the sky. The two
pale-eyed Wise Ones with her made a sharp contrast, faces sun-dark to her pale complexion, fairhaired to her dark, tall to her short, not to mention their dark skirts and white blouses contrasting to
her fine blue wool. Necklaces and bracelets of gold and silver and ivory draped Edarra and Nevarin,
while Seonid wore only her Great Serpent ring. They were young to her ageless. The Wise Ones
matched the Green sister for self-possession, though, and they were studying the sky, too.
“Do you see something?” Perrin asked, putting off the decision.
“We see the sky, Perrin Aybara,” Edarra said calmly, her jewelry making a soft clatter as she
adjusted the dark shawl looped over her elbows. The heat seemed to touch the Aiel as little as it did
the Aes Sedai. “If we saw more, we would tell you.” He hoped they would. He thought they would.

At least, if it was something they believed Grady and Neald might see, too. The two Asha’man would
not keep it secret. He wished they were there instead of back in the camp.
More than half a week ago, now, a lace of the One Power streaking high across the sky had
created quite a stir among the Aes Sedai and Wise Ones. And with Grady and Neald. Which fact had
made a bigger stir still, as close to panic as any Aes Sedai was likely to come. Asha’man, Aes Sedai
and Wise Ones all claimed they could still feel the Power faintly in the air long after that bar of lace
vanished, but nobody knew what it meant. Neald said it made him think of wind, though he could not
tell why. No one would voice more of an opinion than that, yet if both the male and female halves of
the Power were visible, it had to be the Forsaken at work, and on a huge scale. Wondering what they
were up to had kept Perrin awake late most nights since.
In spite of himself, he glanced to the sky. And saw nothing, of course, except a pair of pigeons.
Abruptly a hawk plummeted into his sight, and one of the pigeons was gone in a spray of feathers. The
other winged on frantically toward Bethal.
“Have you reached a decision, Perrin Aybara?” Nevarin asked, a touch sharply. The green-eyed
Wise One appeared even younger than Edarra, perhaps no older than he was, and she did not quite
have the blue-eyed woman’s serenity. Her shawl slid down her arms as she planted hands on hips,
and he half expected her to shake a finger at him. Or a fist. She reminded him of Nynaeve, though they
surely looked nothing alike. Nevarin would have made Nynaeve look plump. “What use our advice if
you will not listen?” she demanded. “What use?”
Faile and Berelain sat straight in their saddles, both as proud as they could be, both smelling
expectant and uncertain at the same time. And irritated at being uncertain; neither liked that one speck.
Seonid was too far to send her scent, but compressed lips gave her mood well enough. Edarra’s
command not to speak unless spoken to infuriated her. Still, she certainly wanted him to take the Wise
Ones’ counsel; she stared at him intently, as though the pressure of her eyes could push him the way
they wanted him to go. In truth, he wanted to choose her, yet he hesitated. How far did her oath of
fealty to Rand truly hold? Further than he would have believed, by the evidence seen so far, but still,
how far could he trust an Aes Sedai? The arrival of Seonid’s two Warders spared him for another
few minutes.
They rode up together, though they had gone out separately, keeping their horses well back into
the trees along the ridgeline so they would not be seen from the town. Furen was a Tairen, nearly as
dark as good soil, with gray streaking his curly black hair, while Teryl, a Murandian, was twenty
years younger, with dark reddish hair, curled mustaches, and eyes bluer than Edarra’s, yet they were
stamped from the same mold, tall and lean and hard. They dismounted smoothly, cloaks shifting
colors and vanishing in a queasy-making way, and made their reports to Seonid, deliberately ignoring
the Wise Ones. And Perrin.
“It’s worse than back north,” Furen said disgustedly. A few drops of sweat beaded on his
forehead, but neither man appeared much affected by the heat. “The local nobles are shut up in their
manors or the town, and the Queen’s soldiers keep inside the town walls. They’ve abandoned the
countryside to the Prophet’s men. And the bandits, though those seem scarce around here. The
Prophet’s people are all over. I think Alliandre will be happy to see you.”
“Rabble,” Teryl snorted, slapping his reins on his palm. “I never saw more than fifteen or twenty
in one place, armed with pitchforks and boar spears mainly. Ragged as beggars, they were. Fit for
scaring farmers, to be sure, but you’d think the lords would be rooting them out and hanging them in
bunches. The Queen will kiss your hand to see a sister.”
Seonid opened her mouth, then glanced up at Edarra, who nodded. If anything, gaining

permission to speak tightened the Green’s mouth more. Her tone was mild as butter, though. “There is
no more reason to put off your decision, Lord Aybara.” She emphasized that title a bit, knowing
exactly how much right he had to it. “Your wife can claim a great House, and Berelain is a ruler, yet
Saldaean Houses count little here, and Mayene is the smallest of nations. An Aes Sedai for an
emissary will put the weight of the White Tower behind you in Alliandre’s eyes.” Perhaps recalling
that Annoura would do for that as well as she, she hurried on. “Besides, I have been in Ghealdan
before, and my name is well known. Alliandre will not only receive me immediately, she will listen
to what I say.”
“Nevarin and I will go with her,” Edarra said, and Nevarin added, “We will make sure she says
nothing she should not.” Seonid ground her teeth audibly, to Perrin’s ears, and busied herself
smoothing her divided skirts, eyes carefully down. Annoura made a sound, very nearly a grunt, and
turned her head from the sight; she herself stayed away from the Wise Ones, and did not like seeing
the other sisters with them.
Perrin wanted to groan. Sending the Green would lift him off a spike, yet the Wise Ones trusted
Aes Sedai less than he did and kept Seonid and Masuri on short leashes. There had been tales about
Aiel in the villages recently, too. None of those folk had ever seen an Aiel, but rumors about the Aiel
following the Dragon Reborn drifted in the air, half of Ghealdan was sure there were Aiel just a day
or two away, and each story was stranger and more horrible than the last. Alliandre might be too
frightened to let him near her once she saw a pair of Aiel women telling an Aes Sedai when to hop.
And Seonid was hopping, however much she ground her teeth! Well, he was not about to risk Faile
without more assurance of her greeting than a vaguely worded letter received months ago. That spike
dug deeper, right between his shoulder blades, yet he had no choice at all.
“A small party will get through those gates easier than a large,” he said finally, stuffing the
looking glass into his saddlebags. It would set fewer tongues wagging, as well. “That means just you
and Annoura, Berelain. And maybe Lord Gallenne. Likely they’ll take him for Annoura’s Warder.”
Berelain chortled in delight, leaning to clasp his arm with both hands. She did not leave it at that,
of course. Her fingers squeezed caressingly, and she flashed a heated smile of promise, then
straightened before he could move, her face suddenly innocent as a babe’s. Expressionless, Faile
focused on pulling her gray riding gloves snug. By her scent, she had not noticed Berelain’s smile.
She hid her disappointment well.
“I’m sorry, Faile,” he said, “but—”
Outrage flared in the smell of her like thorns. “I am certain you have matters to discuss with the
First before she goes, husband,” she said calmly. Her tilted eyes were pure serenity, her scent sand
burrs. “Best you see to her now.” Pulling Swallow around, Faile walked the mare over to a plainly
fuming Seonid and the tight-faced Wise Ones, but she did not dismount or speak to them. Instead she
frowned down at Bethal, a falcon staring from her eyrie.
Perrin realized he was feeling at his nose and pulled his hand down. There was no blood, of
course; his nose only felt as if there should be.
Berelain needed no last-minute instructions—the First of Mayene and her Gray advisor were all
impatience to be off, all certainty they knew what to say and do—yet Perrin stressed caution anyway,
and emphasized that Berelain and only Berelain was to speak with Alliandre. Annoura gave him one
of those cool Aes Sedai looks and nodded. Which might have been agreement or might not; he
doubted he could get more out of her with a prybar. Berelain’s lips curled in amusement, though she
agreed with everything he said. Or said she did. He suspected she would say anything to get what she
wanted, and those smiles in all the wrong places bothered him. Gallenne had put his looking glass

away, but he was still playing with his reins, no doubt calculating how to carve a way out of Bethal
for the two women. Perrin wanted to growl.
He watched them ride down to the road with worry. The message Berelain carried was simple.
Rand understood Alliandre’s caution, but if she wanted his protection she must be willing to
announce support for him openly. That protection would come, soldiers and Asha’man to make it
plain to everyone, and even Rand himself if need be, once she agreed to make the announcement.
Berelain had no reason to change the message a hair, despite her smiles—he thought they might be
another way of flirting—but Annoura. . . . Aes Sedai did what they did, and the Light alone knew why
half the time. He wished he knew some way to reach Alliandre without using a sister or rousing talk.
Or risking Faile.
The three riders reached the gates with Annoura in the lead, and guards quickly raised pikes,
lowered bows and crossbows, no doubt as soon as she named herself Aes Sedai. Not many people
had the nerve to challenge that particular claim. There was barely a pause before she was leading the
way into the town. In fact, the soldiers seemed eager to hurry them through, out of sight of anyone
watching from the hills. Some peered at the distant heights, and Perrin did not need to smell them to
sense their unease over who might be hidden up there, who might, improbably, have recognized a
sister.
Turning north, toward their camp, Perrin led the way along the ridge until they were out of sight
from Bethal’s towers, then slanted down to the hard-packed road. Scattered farms lined the road,
thatch-roofed houses and long narrow barns, withered pastures and stubbled fields and high-walled
stone goatpens, but there was little livestock to be seen and fewer people. Those few watched the
riders warily, geese watching foxes, stopping chores where they stood until the horses passed on.
Aram kept as close an eye on them in return, sometimes fingering the sword hilt rising above his
shoulder, perhaps wishing to find more than farmfolk. Despite his green-striped coat, little Tinker
remained in him.
Edarra and Nevarin walked beside Stepper, seemingly out for a stroll yet keeping pace easily
despite their bulky skirts. Seonid heeled them on her gelding, Furen and Teryl at her own back. The
pale-cheeked Green pretended that she simply wanted to ride a careful two paces behind the Wise
Ones, but the men scowled openly. Warders often had a greater care for their Aes Sedai’s dignity than
the sister did herself, and Aes Sedai had enough for queens.
Faile kept Swallow on the far side of the Aiel women, riding in silence, apparently studying the
drought-scarred landscape. Slim and graceful, she made Perrin feel a little clumsy at the best of times.
She was quicksilver, and he loved it in her, usually, but. . . . A slight breath of air had begun to stir,
enough to keep her scent mingled with the rest. He knew he should be thinking about Alliandre and
what her answer would be, or better still, the Prophet and how to find him once Alliandre replied,
however she did, but he could not find room in his head.
He had expected Faile to be angry when he chose Berelain, for all that Rand supposedly had sent
her for the purpose. Faile knew he did not want to send her into danger, into any risk of danger, a fact
she disliked more than she did Berelain. Yet her scent had been soft as a summer morning—until he
tried to apologize! Well, apologies usually stoked her anger if she already was angry—except when
they melted her temper, anyway—but she had not been angry! Without Berelain, everything ran
smooth as silk satin between them. Most of the time. But explanations that he did nothing to encourage
the woman—far from it!—earned only a curt “Of course you don’t!” in tones that called him a fool for
bringing it up. But she still grew angry—with him!—every time Berelain smiled at him or found an
excuse to touch him, no matter how brusquely he put her off, and the Light knew he did that. Short of

tying her up, he did not know what more he could do to discourage her. Ginger attempts to find out
from Faile what he was doing wrong received a light “Why do you think you’ve done anything?” or a
not-so-light “What do you think you’ve done?” or a flat “I do not want to talk about it.” He was doing
something wrong, but he could not puzzle out what! He had to, though. Nothing was more important
than Faile. Nothing!
“Lord Perrin?”
Aram’s excited voice cut into his brown study. “Don’t call me that,” he muttered, following the
direction of the man’s pointing finger, to yet another abandoned farm some distance ahead, where fire
had taken the roof from house and barn. Only rough stone walls stood. An abandoned farm, but not
deserted. Angry shouts rose up there.
A dozen or more rough-clad fellows carrying spears and pitchforks were trying to force their
way over the chest-high stone wall of a goatpen, while a handful of men within tried to keep them out.
Several horses ran loose inside, frightened at the noise and dodging about, and there were three
women mounted. They were not simply waiting to see how it would all turn out, though; one of the
women appeared to be hurling rocks, and even as he looked, another dashed close to the wall to lash
out with a long cudgel while the third reared her horse, and a tall fellow toppled back off the wall to
get clear of flashing hooves. But there were too many attackers, too much wall to defend.
“I advise you to ride wide,” Seonid said. Edarra and Nevarin turned grim stares on her, but she
plowed on, hurry overwhelming her matter-of-fact tone. “Those are surely the Prophet’s men, and
killing his people is a bad way to begin. Tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, may die if you fail
with him. Is it worth risking that to save a handful?”
Perrin did not intend to kill anyone if he could help it, but he did not intend to look the other way
either. He wasted no time in explanations, though. “Can you frighten them?” he asked Edarra. “Just
frighten?” He remembered all too well what the Wise Ones had done at Dumai’s Wells. And the
Asha’man. Maybe as well Grady and Neald were not there.
“Perhaps,” Edarra replied, studying the crowd around the pen. She half-shook her head,
shrugged a fraction. “Perhaps.” That would have to be good enough.
“Aram, Furen, Teryl,” he snapped, “with me!” He dug in his heels, and as Stepper leaped
forward, he was relieved to see the Warders following closely. Four men charging made a better
show than two. He kept his hands on the reins, away from his axe.
He was not so pleased when Faile galloped Swallow up alongside him. He opened his mouth,
and she arched an eyebrow at him. Her black hair was beautiful, streaming in the wind of their rush.
She was beautiful. An arched eyebrow; no more. He changed what he had been about to say. “Guard
my back,” he told her. Smiling, she produced a dagger from somewhere. With all the blades she
carried hidden away, sometimes he wondered how he missed being stabbed just trying to hug her.
As soon as she looked ahead again, he gestured frantically to Aram, trying to keep the motion
where she could not see. Aram nodded, but he was leaning forward, sword bared, ready to skewer
the first of the Prophet’s folk he reached. Perrin hoped the man understood he was to guard Faile’s
back, and the rest of her, if they actually came to grips with those fellows.
None of the ruffians had noticed them yet. Perrin shouted, but they seemed not to hear over their
own yelling. A man in a coat too big for him managed to scramble atop the wall, and two others
appeared about to get over. If the Wise Ones were going to do anything, it was past—
A thunderclap nearly over their heads almost deafened Perrin, a mountainous crack that made
Stepper stumble before regaining his pace. The attackers certainly noticed that, staggering and looking
around wildly, some clapping hands over their ears. The man on the wall overbalanced and fell off

outside. He leaped up immediately, though, angrily gesturing to the enclosure, and some of his
companions leaped back at it. Others saw Perrin then and pointed, their mouths working, but still no
one ran. A few hefted weapons.
Suddenly a horizontal wheel of fire appeared above the goatpen, as wide as a man was tall,
flinging off sputtering tufts of flame as it spun with a moan that rose and fell, mournful groan to
keening wail and back.
The rough-clad men broke in every direction like scattering quail. For a moment longer the man
in a too-big coat waved his arms and shouted at them, then with one last glance at the fiery wheel, he
too darted away.
Perrin almost laughed. He would not have to kill anyone. And he would not have to worry about
Faile getting a pitchfork through her ribs.
Apparently the people in the pen were as frightened as those outside, one of them at least. The
woman who had reared her horse at the attackers slipped open the gate and kicked her mount to an
awkward gallop. Up the road, away from Perrin and the others.
“Wait!” Perrin shouted. “We won’t harm you!” Whether she heard or not, she kept whipping her
reins. A bundle tied behind her saddle bounced wildly. Those men might be running as hard as they
could now, but if she went off by herself, even two or three could do her injury. Lying flat on
Stepper’s neck, Perrin dug in his heels, and the dun shot forward like an arrow.
He was a big man, yet Stepper had earned his name for more than prancing feet. Besides, by its
lumbering run, the woman’s mount was hardly fit for a saddle. With every stride Stepper closed the
gap, nearer, nearer, until Perrin was able to reach out and seize the other horse’s bridle. Up close, her
hammer-nosed bay was little better than crowbait, lathered and worn out more than the short run
could account for. Slowly he drew both horses to a halt.
“Forgive me if I frightened you, Mistress,” he said. “Truly, I mean you no harm.”
For the second time that day an apology did not get the response he expected. Angry blue eyes
glared at him from a face surrounded by long red-gold curls, a face as regal as any queen’s for all that
it was plastered with sweat and dust. Her dress was plain wool, travel-stained and as dusty as her
cheeks, but her face was furious as well as queenly. “I do not need,” she began in chill tones, trying to
jerk her horse free, then cut off as another of the women, white-haired and bony, galloped up on a
slab-sided brown mare in worse condition than the bay. They had been riding hard for some time,
these folk. The older woman was just as worn and dust-covered as the younger.
She alternated between beaming at Perrin and scowling at the woman whose bridle he still held.
“Thank you, my Lord.” Her voice, thin but strong, gave a hitch as she noticed his eyes, but goldenyellow eyes on a man slowed her only an instant. Not a woman fazed by much. She still carried the
stout stick she had been using for a weapon. “A most timely rescue. Maighdin, whatever were you
thinking? You could have gotten yourself killed! And the rest of us, too! She’s a headstrong girl, my
Lord, always leaping before she looks. Remember, child, a fool abandons friends, and gives up silver
for shiny brass. We do thank you, my Lord, and Maighdin will, too, when she comes to her senses.”
Maighdin, a good ten years older than Perrin, could only be called a girl in comparison to the
older woman, but despite weary grimaces that matched her scent, frustration tinged with anger, she
accepted the tirade, only pulling once more in a halfhearted attempt to free her horse, then giving up.
Letting her hands rest on her cantle, she frowned at Perrin accusingly, then blinked. The yellow eyes
again. Yet despite that strangeness, she still did not smell afraid. The old woman did, but Perrin did
not think it was of him.
Another of Maighdin’s companions, an unshaven man mounted on yet another bedraggled horse,

this a knob-kneed gray, approached while the old woman was talking, but kept back. He was tall, as
tall as Perrin if not nearly so wide, in a travel-worn dark coat with a sword belted over. Like the
women, he had a bundle tied on behind his saddle. That tiny breeze swirled to bring Perrin his scent.
He was not afraid; he was wary. And if the way he looked at Maighdin was any guide, it was she he
was wary of. Maybe this was not so simple as rescuing travelers from a gang of ruffians after all.
“Perhaps you should all come to my camp,” Perrin said, finally releasing the bridle. “You’ll be
safe from . . . brigands . . . there.” He half expected Maighdin to make a break for the nearest tree
line, but she turned her horse with his, back toward the goatpen. She smelled . . . resigned.
Even so, she said, “I thank you for the offer, but I . . . we . . . must continue our journey. We will
go on, Lini,” she added firmly, and the older woman frowned at her so sternly that he wondered
whether they were mother and daughter despite her use of the woman’s name. They certainly looked
nothing alike. Lini was narrow-faced and parchment-skinned, all sinew, while Maighdin might be
beautiful under that dust. If a man liked fair hair.
Perrin glanced over his shoulder at the man trailing after. A hard-looking fellow, in need of a
razor. Perhaps he liked fair hair. Perhaps he liked it too much. Men had made trouble for themselves
as well as others for that reason before this.
Ahead, Faile was sitting Swallow and peering over the wall of the pen at the people inside.
Perhaps one of them had been hurt. Seonid and the Wise Ones were nowhere in sight. Aram had
understood, apparently; he was close to Faile, though looking impatiently toward Perrin. The danger
was clearly past, though.
Before Perrin was halfway to the goatpen, Teryl appeared with a narrow-eyed, stubble-cheeked
man stumbling along beside his roan, the collar of his coat gripped in the Warder’s fist. “I thought we
should catch one of them,” Teryl said with a hard grin. “Always best to hear both sides, whatever you
thought you saw, my old da always said.” Perrin was surprised; he had thought Teryl could not think
beyond the end of his sword.
Even hiked up as it was, the stubble-cheeked fellow’s frayed coat was plainly too big for him.
Perrin doubted anyone else had been able to see well enough at the distance, but he recognized that
thrusting nose, too. This man had been the last to run, and he was not cowed now, either. His sneer
took them all in. “You’re all in deep muck, for this,” he rasped. “We was doing the Prophet’s
bidding, we was. The Prophet says if a man bothers a woman as doesn’t want him, he dies. This lot
was chasing after her”—he jerked his chin at Maighdin—“and she was running hard. The Prophet’ll
have your ears for this!” He spat for emphasis.
“That is ridiculous,” Maighdin announced in a clear voice. “These people are my friends. This
man completely misunderstood what he saw.”
Perrin nodded, and if she thought he was agreeing with her, all well and good. But putting what
this fellow said alongside what Lini had. . . . Not simple at all.
Faile and the others joined them, followed by the rest of Maighdin’s traveling companions, three
more men and another woman, all leading worn-down horses with few miles left in them. Not that
they had been prime horseflesh in some years, if ever. A finer collection of buck knees, bow hocks,
spavins, and swaybacks, Perrin could not recall. As always, his gaze went first to Faile—his nostrils
strained for her scent—but Seonid snagged his eyes. Slumped in her saddle, flushing scarlet, she
wore a sullen glower, and her face looked odd, her cheeks puffed out and her mouth not quite closed.
There was something, a bit of red-and-blue. . . . Perrin blinked. Unless he was seeing things, she had
a wadded-up scarf stuffed into her mouth! Apparently when Wise Ones told an apprentice to be quiet,
even an Aes Sedai apprentice, they meant it.

He was not the only one with sharp eyes; Maighdin’s mouth fell open when she saw Seonid, and
she gave him a long, considering look as if he were responsible for the scarf. So she knew an Aes
Sedai on sight, did she? Uncommon, for the country woman she appeared. She did not sound like one,
though.
Furen, riding behind Seonid, wore a thunderhead for a face, but it was Teryl who made
everything even less simple by tossing something to the ground. “I found this behind him,” he said,
“where he might have dropped it, running.”
At first, Perrin did not know what he was looking at, a long loop of rawhide thickly strung with
what appeared to be tags of shriveled leather. Then he did know, and his teeth bared in a snarl. “The
Prophet would have our ears, you said.”
The stubble-cheeked man stopped gaping at Seonid and licked his lips. “That . . . that’s Hari’s
work!” he protested. “Hari’s a mean one. He likes to keep count, take trophies, and he . . . uh. . . .”
Shrugging in his captive coat, he sank in on himself like a cornered dog. “You can’t tie that to me! The
Prophet’ll hang you if you touch me! He’s hanged nobles before, fine lords and ladies. I walk in the
Light of the blessed Lord Dragon!”
Perrin walked Stepper to the man, careful to keep the dun’s hooves clear of the . . . thing . . . on
the ground. He wanted nothing less than to have the fellow’s scent in his nose, but he bent down,
putting his face closer. Sour sweat warred with fear, panic, a tinge of anger. A pity he could not sniff
out guilt. “Might have dropped” was not “had dropped.” Close-set eyes widened, and the man
pressed back against Teryl’s gelding. Yellow eyes had their uses.
“If I could tie that to you, you’d hang from the nearest tree,” he growled. The fellow blinked,
began to brighten as he understood what that meant, but Perrin gave him no time to regain his bluster.
“I’m Perrin Aybara, and your precious Lord Dragon sent me here. You spread the word. He sent me,
and if I find a man with . . . trophies . . . he hangs! If I find a man burning a farm, he hangs! If one of
you looks at me cross-eyed, he hangs! And you can tell Masema I said so, too!” Disgusted, Perrin
straightened. “Let him go, Teryl. If he isn’t out of my sight in two shakes . . . !”
Teryl’s hand opened, and the fellow dashed off at a dead run for the nearest trees, never so much
as glancing back. Part of Perrin’s disgust was for himself. Threatening! If one of them looked at him
cross-eyed? But if the nameless man had not cut off ears himself, he had watched it and done nothing.
Faile was smiling, pride shining through the sweat on her face. Her look washed away some of
Perrin’s revulsion. He would walk barefoot through fire for that look.
Not everyone approved, of course. Seonid’s eyes were squeezed shut, and her gloved fists
quivered on her reins as though she desperately wanted to yank that scarf from her mouth and tell him
what she thought. He could guess anyway. Edarra and Nevarin had gathered their shawls around them
and were eyeing him darkly. Oh, yes; he could guess.
“I thought it was to be all secrecy,” Teryl said casually, watching the stubble-cheeked man run.
“I thought Masema wasn’t to know you were here till you spoke in his pink ear.”
That had been the plan. Rand had suggested it as a precaution, Seonid and Masuri had insisted
on it every chance they got. After all, Prophet of the Lord Dragon or no, Masema might notwant to
come face-to-face with someone Rand sent, considering the things he was said to have allowed.
Those ears were not the worst, if the tenth part of rumor was to be believed. Edarra and the other
Wise Ones saw Masema as a possible enemy, to be ambushed before he could set his own trap.
“I’m supposed to stop . . . that,” Perrin said, gesturing angrily to the rawhide string on the
ground. He had heard the rumors, and done nothing. Now he had seen. “I might as well start now.”
And if Masema decided he was an enemy? How many thousands followed the Prophet, out of belief

or fear? It did not matter. “It stops, Teryl. It stops!”
The Murandian nodded slowly, eyeing Perrin as though seeing him for the first time.
“My Lord Perrin?” Maighdin said. He had forgotten all about her and her friends. The others had
gathered with her a little way off, most still afoot. There were three men aside from the fellow who
had followed Maighdin, and two of those were hiding behind their horses. Lini appeared the wariest
of all, eyes focused on him worriedly; she had her horse close to Maighdin’s and seemed ready to
seize the bridle herself. Not to stop the younger woman bolting, but to bolt herself and take Maighdin
with her. Maighdin herself appeared completely at ease, but she also studied Perrin. Little wonder,
after all that talk of the Prophet and the Dragon Reborn, on top of his eyes. Not to mention an Aes
Sedai gagged. He expected her to say that they wanted to go now, immediately, but what she said
instead was “We will accept your kind offer. A day or two resting in your camp might be just the
thing.”
“As you say, Mistress Maighdin,” he said slowly. Masking his surprise was difficult. Especially
since he had just recognized the two men trying to keep their horses between them and him. Ta’veren
work, to bring them here? A strange twist in any case. “It might be just the thing at that.”

CHAPTER
8

A Simple Country Woman

T he camp lay about a league farther on, well back from the road among low, wooded hills,
just beyond a stream that was ten paces’ width of stones and only five of water never deeper
than a man’s knees. Tiny green and silver fish darted away from the horses’ hooves. Casual
passersby were unlikely to come on them here. The nearest inhabited farm was over a mile
away, and Perrin had checked personally to make sure those folk took their animals to water
elsewhere.
He truly had been trying to avoid notice as much as possible, traveling by back roads and the
smallest country paths when they could not keep to the forests. A futile effort, really. The horses could
be pastured wherever there was grass, but they required at least some grain, and even a small army
had to buy food, and a lot of it. Every man needed four pounds a day, in flour and beans and meat.
Rumors must have been floating all over Ghealdan, though with luck, no one suspected who they
were. Perrin grimaced. Perhaps they had not, until he went and opened his mouth. Still, he would
have done nothing differently.
It was three camps really, close to one another and none far from the stream. They traveled
together, all following him, obeying him supposedly, but there were too many personalities involved,
and no one was entirely sure the others aimed at the same goal. Some nine hundred or so Winged
Guards had their cook fires crowded between rows of picketed horses in a broad meadow of
trampled brown grass. He tried to close his nose to the mingled smells of horses, sweat, dung and
boiling goat meat, an unpleasant combination on a hot day. A dozen mounted sentries rode a slow
circuit in pairs, their long, red-streamered lances all at precisely the same angle, but the rest of the
Mayeners had shed breastplates and helmets. Coatless and often shirtless in the sun, they lay
sprawled on their blankets or diced as they waited on the food. Some looked up as Perrin passed, a
number straightened from what they were doing to study the additions to his party, but none came
running, so the patrols were still out. Small patrols, without lances, who could see without being
seen. Well, that was the hope. It had been.
A handful of gai’shain moved at various chores among the Wise Ones’ low gray-brown tents on
the sparsely wooded crest of the hill above the Mayeners. At this distance, the white-robed figures

appeared harmless, eyes downcast and meek. Up close, they would look the same, but most were
Shaido. The Wise Ones claimed gai’shain were gai’shain; Perrin did not trust any Shaido out of his
sight. Off to one side on the slope, beneath a bedraggled sourgum, perhaps a dozen Maidens in
cadin’sor knelt in a circle around Sulin, the toughest of them despite her white hair. She had sent out
scouts, too, women who could move as fast afoot as the Mayeners on their horses and were much
more likely to escape unwanted attention. None of the Wise Ones up there were in the open, but a
slender woman stirring a large stew kettle straightened, knuckling her back as she watched Perrin and
the others pass. A woman in a green silk riding dress.
He could see the glare on Masuri’s face. Aes Sedai did not stir kettles, nor perform twenty other
tasks the Wise Ones had her and Seonid doing. Masuri laid it at Rand’s feet, but he was not here, and
Perrin was. Given half a chance, she would peel his hide for him.
Edarra and Nevarin turned up that way, even in those bulky skirts barely disturbing the layers of
dead leaves that carpeted the ground. Seonid followed, her cheeks still bulging around that scarf. She
twisted in her saddle, peering back at Perrin. If he could have believed an Aes Sedai looking anxious,
that was what he would have called her. Riding behind her, Furen and Teryl wore scowls.
Masuri saw them coming and hastily bent back to the black kettle, stirring with renewed vigor,
trying to make out that she had never stopped. So long as Masuri stayed in the Wise Ones’ charge,
Perrin thought he did not have to worry about his hide. The Wise Ones seemed to keep a very short
leash.
Nevarin looked back over her shoulder at him, another of those dark stares he had been getting
from her and Edarra since sending his warning, his threat, by the stubble-cheeked fellow. Perrin
exhaled in exasperation. He did not have to worry about his pelt unless the Wise Ones decided they
wanted it. Too many personalities. Too many goals.
Maighdin rode at Faile’s side, seemingly paying no attention to what they passed, but he would
not have wagered a split copper on it. Her eyes had widened a hair at sight of the Mayener sentries.
She knew what red breastplates and helmets like rimmed pots meant, as surely as she had recognized
an Aes Sedai face. Most people would not have known either, especially not folk dressed as she was.
She was a mystery, this Maighdin. For some reason, she seemed vaguely familiar.
Lini and Tallanvor—that was what he had heard Maighdin call the fellow who had ridden after
her; “young” Tallanvor, though there could not have been more than four or five years between them if
that—stayed as close behind Maighdin as possible, with Aram in the way trying to heel Perrin. So did
a little stick of a fellow with a pursed mouth, called Balwer, who seemed to pay less heed to their
surroundings than Maighdin pretended. Even so, Perrin thought Balwer saw more than she did. He
could not say why, precisely, but the few times he had caught the bony little man’s scent, he had been
minded of a wolf testing the air. Strangely, there was no fear in Balwer, only quickly suppressed
ridges of irritation shot through with the quivery smell of impatience. The remainder of Maighdin’s
companions trailed along well back. The third woman, Breane, was whispering fiercely to a hulking
fellow who kept his eyes down and sometimes nodded silently, sometimes shook his head. A
shoulderstriker and street tough if ever there was one, but the short woman had an edge of toughness
about her, too. The last man sheltered behind those two, a stout man with a battered straw hat pulled
low to hide his face. On him, the sword the men all wore looked as strange as it did on Balwer.
The third part of the camp, spread out among the trees just around the curve of the hill from the
Mayeners, covered as much ground as the Winged Guards’ though it held far fewer people. Here, the
horses were picketed well away from the cook fires, so the unblemished smell of dinner filled the air.
Roasting goat, this time, and hard turnips the farmers probably had intended to feed to their pigs even

with times as hard as they were. Close on to three hundred Two Rivers men who had followed Perrin
away from home were tending meat on spits, mending clothes, checking over arrows and bows, all
scattered in haphazard clumps of five or six friends around a fire. Nearly every one of them waved
and shouted greetings, though there was too much of “Lord Perrin” and “Perrin Goldeneyes” to suit
him. Faile had a right to the titles they gave her.
Grady and Neald, unsweating in their night-black coats, did not cheer; standing beside the cook
fire they had built a little away from everyone else, they merely looked at him. Expectant looks, he
thought. Expecting what? That was the question he always asked himself about them. The Asha’man
made him uneasy, more than Aes Sedai or Wise Ones. Women channeling the Power was natural, if
not exactly anything a man could be comfortable around. Plain-faced Grady appeared a farmer
despite his coat and sword, and Neald a popinjay with his curled mustaches, yet Perrin could not
forget what they were, what they had done at Dumai’s Wells. But then, he had been there, too. The
Light help him, he had. Pulling his hand from the axe at his belt, he dismounted.
Servants, men and women from Lord Dobraine’s estates in Cairhien, came running from the lines
where the horses were picketed, to take their mounts. None stood taller than Perrin’s shoulder,
country-clad folk, forever bowing and curtsying obsequiously. Faile said he just upset them when he
tried to make them stop, or at least not to bob around him so often; in truth, that was how they smelled
when he did, and they always went back to bobbing in an hour or two. Others, nearly as many as the
Two Rivers men, were working with the horses or around the long rows of high-wheeled carts that
hauled all their supplies. A few were darting in and out of a large red-and-white tent.
As usual, that tent made Perrin grunt gloomily. Berelain had a larger one back in the Mayener
part of the camp, plus one for her two maids and another for the pair of thief-catchers she had insisted
on bringing. Annoura had a tent of her own, and Gallenne as well, but only he and Faile possessed
one here. For himself, he would have slept under the sky like the other men from home. They had
nothing over them at night but a blanket. There was certainly no fear of rain. The Cairhienin servants
bedded down beneath the carts. He could not ask Faile to do that, though, not when Berelain had a
tent. If only he could have left Berelain in Cairhien. But then he would have had to send Faile into
Bethal.
A pair of banners on tall, fresh-cut poles in the middle of a clear space near the tent soured his
mood further. The breeze had picked up a trifle, though it was still too warm; he thought he heard that
thunder again, faint in the west. The flags unfolded in slow waves, collapsed of their own weight,
rippled open again. His crimson-bordered Red Wolfhead and the Red Eagle of long-dead
Manetheren, out in the open again despite his orders. Perhaps he had stopped trying to hide, after a
fashion, but what was now Ghealdan had been part of Manetheren; Alliandre would not be soothed by
hearing of that banner! He managed a pleasant face and a smile for the stocky little woman who
curtsied deeply and took Stepper away, but it was a near thing. Lords were supposed to be obeyed,
and if he was supposed to be a lord, well, he seemed to be making a poor job of it.
Fists on her hips, Maighdin stood studying those rippling flags as her horse was taken off with
the rest. Surprisingly, Breane had both their bundles, held awkwardly; she wore a petulant scowl,
directed at the other woman. “I have heard about banners like those,” Maighdin said suddenly. And
angrily; there was no anger in her voice, and her face was smooth as ice, but her fury filled Perrin’s
nose. “They were raised by men in Andor, in the Two Rivers, who rebelled against their lawful ruler.
Aybara is a Two Rivers name, I think.”
“We don’t know much about lawful rulers in the Two Rivers, Mistress Maighdin,” he growled.
He was going to skin whoever had put them up this time. If stories about rebellion had spread this far.

. . . He faced too many complications already without adding more. “I suppose Morgase was a good
queen, but we had to fend for ourselves, and we did.” Abruptly he knew who she reminded him of.
Elayne. Not that it meant anything; he had seen men a thousand miles from the Two Rivers who could
have belonged to families he knew back home. Still, she had to have some reason for anger. Her
accent could be Andoran. “Things aren’t as bad in Andor as you might have heard,” he told her.
“Caemlyn was quiet, last I was there, and Rand—the Dragon Reborn—means to put Morgase’s
daughter Elayne on the Lion Throne.”
Far from being mollified, Maighdin rounded on him, blue eyes blazing. “He intends to put her on
the throne? No man puts a queen on the Lion Throne! Elayne will claim the throne of Andor by her
right!”
Scratching his head, Perrin wished Faile would stop watching the woman so calmly and say
something. But all she did was tuck her riding gloves behind her belt. Before he could think of what to
say, Lini darted in, seizing Maighdin’s arm and giving her a shake fit to rattle her teeth.
“You apologize!” the old woman barked. “This man saved your life, Maighdin, and you forget
yourself, a simple country woman speaking so to a lord! Remember who you are, and don’t let your
tongue land you in hotter water! If this young lord was at odds with Morgase, well, everyone knows
she’s dead, and it’s none of your affair in any event! Now apologize before he grows angry!”
Maighdin stared at Lini, her mouth working, even more startled than Perrin. Again she surprised
him, though. Instead of erupting at the white-haired woman, she slowly drew herself up, shoulders
squared, and looked him in the eye. “Lini is entirely right. I have no right to speak to you so, Lord
Aybara. I apologize. Humbly. And I ask your pardon.” Humble? Her jaw was stubborn, her tone
proud enough for an Aes Sedai, and her scent said she was ready to chew a hole in something.
“You have it,” Perrin said hastily. Which did not seem to placate her one bit. She smiled, and
maybe she intended gratitude, but he could hear her teeth grinding. Were women all crazy?
“They are hot and dirty, husband,” Faile said, putting a hand in at last, “and the last few hours
have been trying for them, I know. Aram can show the men where to clean themselves. I will take the
women with me. I’ll have damp cloths brought to wash your hands and faces,” she told Maighdin and
Lini. Gathering up Breane with a gesture, she began herding them toward the tent. At a nod from
Perrin, Aram motioned the men to follow him.
“As soon as you finish your wash, Master Gill, I’d like to talk with you,” Perrin said.
He might as well have made that spinning wheel of fire. Maighdin whipped around to gape at
him, and the other two women froze in their tracks. Tallanvor was suddenly gripping his sword hilt
again, and Balwer rose on his toes, peering over his bundle, head tilting this way then that. Not a
wolf, perhaps; some sort of bird, watching for cats. The stout man, Basel Gill, dropped his
belongings and leaped a foot in the air.
“Why, Perrin,” he stammered, snatching off the straw hat. Sweat made tracks in the dust on his
cheeks. He bent to pick up his bundle, changed his mind and straightened again hastily. “I mean, Lord
Perrin. I . . . ah . . . I thought it was you, but . . . but with them calling you lord, I wasn’t sure you’d
want to know an old innkeeper.” Scrubbing a handkerchief across his nearly bald head, he laughed
nervously. “Of course, I’ll talk to you. Washing can wait a little longer.”
“Hello, Perrin,” the hulking man said. With his heavy-lidded eyes, Lamgwin Dorn appeared lazy
despite his muscles and the scars on his face and hands. “We heard about young Rand being the
Dragon Reborn, Master Gill and me. Should have figured you’d have come up in the world, too.
Perrin Aybara’s a good man, Mistress Maighdin. I think you could trust him with anything you’ve a
mind to.” He was not lazy, and he was not stupid, either.

Aram jerked his head impatiently, and Lamgwin and the other two followed, but Tallanvor and
Balwer dragged their feet, casting wondering glances back at Perrin and Master Gill. Concerned
glances. And at the women. Faile had them moving again, as well, though with plenty of darted looks
at Perrin and Master Gill, at the men trailing Aram. Suddenly they were not so pleased at being
separated.
Master Gill mopped his forehead and smiled uneasily. Light, why did he smell afraid? Perrin
wondered. Of him? Of a man tied to the Dragon Reborn, calling himself lord and leading an army,
however small, threatening the Prophet. Might as well throw gagging Aes Sedai into it, too; he would
take the blame for that, one way or another. No, Perrin thought wryly; nothing in that to frighten
anybody. The whole lot of them were probably afraid he might murder them all.
Trying to put Master Gill at ease, he led the man to a large oak a hundred paces from the redand-white tent. Most of the great tree’s leaves were gone and half those left were brown, but massive
limbs spreading low provided a little shade, and some of the gnarled roots stood high enough to serve
as benches. Perrin had used one for just that, twiddling his thumbs while camp was being set.
Whenever he tried to do anything useful, there were always ten hands snatching it away from him.
Basel Gill was not eased, however much Perrin asked after the Queen’s Blessing, his inn in
Caemlyn, or recalled his own visit there. But then, perhaps Gill was remembering that that visit was
not the thing to calm a man, with Aes Sedai and talk of the Dark One and a flight in the night. He
paced anxiously and hugged his bundle to his chest, shifted it from one arm to the other and answered
in a bare handful of words, licking his lips between.
“Master Gill,” Perrin told him finally, “stop calling me Lord Perrin. I’m not. It’s complicated,
but I’m not a lord. You know that.”
“Of course,” the round man replied, at last seating himself on one of the oak roots. He appeared
reluctant to set his bundled things down, drawing his hands from them slowly. “As you say, Lord
Perrin. Ah, Rand . . . the Lord Dragon . . . he really means the Lady Elayne to have the throne? Not
that I doubt your word, of course,” he added hurriedly. Pulling off his hat, he began mopping his
forehead again. Even for such a round man, he seemed to be sweating twice as much as the heat
called for. “I’m sure the Lord Dragon will do just as you say.” His laugh was shaky. “You wanted to
talk to me. And not about my old inn, I’m sure.”
Perrin exhaled wearily. He had thought nothing could be worse than old friends and neighbors
bowing and scraping, but at least they forgot sometimes and spoke their minds. And none of them was
afraid of him. “You’re a long way from home,” he said in a gentle voice. No need to go too fast, not
with a man ready to jump out of his skin. “I wondered what brought you here. Not troubles of any
kind, I hope.”
“You tell him right, Basel Gill,” Lini said sharply, marching up to the oak. “No embroidery,
mind.” She had not been gone very long, yet somehow she had found time to wash her face and hands
and work her hair into a neat white bun on the back of her head. And to beat most of the dust from her
plain woolen dress. Bobbing a perfunctory curtsy in Perrin’s direction, she turned to shake a gnarled
finger at Gill. “ ‘Three things annoy to distraction: a tooth that aches, a shoe that pinches, and a man
that chatters.’ So you hold to the point and don’t go telling the young lord more than he wants to hear.”
For a moment she held the gaping innkeeper with an admonitory stare, then abruptly gave Perrin
another quick curtsy. “He does love the sound of his own voice—most men do—but he’ll tell it to you
properly, now, my Lord.”
Master Gill glowered at her, and muttered under his breath when she waved sharply for him to
speak. “Bony old . . .” was what Perrin heard. “What happened—the simple and straight of it—” The

round man glared at Lini again, but she did not appear to notice, “was that I had some business down
to Lugard. A chance to import wine. But you’re not interested in that. I took Lamgwin along, of
course, and Breane, because she won’t let him out of her sight an hour she doesn’t have to. Along the
way, we met Mistress Dorlain, Mistress Maighdin as we call her, and Lini, and Tallanvor. And
Balwer, of course. On the road. Near to Lugard.”
“Maighdin and I were in service in Murandy,” Lini put in impatiently. “Until the troubles.
Tallanvor was an armsman to the House, and Balwer the secretary. Bandits burned the manor, and our
lady couldn’t afford to keep us, so we decided to travel together for protection.”
“I was telling it, Lini,” Master Gill grumbled, scratching behind his ear. “The wine merchant had
left Lugard for the country, for some reason, and . . .” He shook his head. “It’s all too much to go into,
Perrin. Lord Perrin, I mean. Forgive me. You know there’s trouble everywhere nowadays, one kind
or another. Seems like every time we ran from one kind, we found another, and always getting farther
from Caemlyn. Till here we are, tired and grateful for a rest. And that’s the short of it.”
Perrin nodded slowly. That could be simple truth, though he had learned that people had a
hundred reasons for lying, or just shading the truth. Grimacing, he raked fingers through his hair.
Light! He was becoming suspicious as a Cairhienin, and the deeper Rand tangled him, the worse it
got. Why on earth would Basel Gill, of all people, lie to him? A lady’s maid, accustomed to privilege
and fallen on hard times; that explained Maighdin. Some things were simple.
Lini’s hands were folded at her waist, but she watched with a keen eye, no little like a falcon
herself, and Master Gill began fidgeting as soon as he stopped talking. He seemed to take Perrin’s
grimace as a demand for more. He laughed, more on edge than amused. “I haven’t seen so much of the
world since the Aiel War, and I was considerably skinnier, then. Why, we’ve been as far as Amador.
Of course, we left after those Seanchan took the city, but truth, they aren’t any worse than the
Whitecloaks, that I could—” He cut off as Perrin leaned forward abruptly and seized his lapel.
“Seanchan, Master Gill? Are you sure of that? Or is it one of those rumors, like the Aiel, or Aes
Sedai?”
“I saw them,” Gill replied, exchanging uncertain looks with Lini. “And that’s what they call
themselves. I’m surprised you don’t know. Word’s been running ahead of us all the way from
Amador. These Seanchan want people to know what they’re about. Strange people, with strange
creatures.” His voice picked up intensity. “Like Shadowspawn. Big leathery things that fly, and carry
men, and these things like lizards, only they’re big as horses, and they have three eyes. I saw them! I
did!”
“I believe you,” Perrin said, releasing the man’s coat. “I’ve seen them, too.” At Falme, where a
thousand Whitecloaks died in minutes and it had taken dead heroes of legend, called by the Horn of
Valere, to throw the Seanchan back. Rand had said they would return, but how could they have so
soon? Light! If they held Amador, they had to have Tarabon as well, or most of it. Only a fool killed a
deer when he knew there was a wounded bear behind his back. How much had they taken? “I can’t
send you to Caemlyn right away, Master Gill, but if you stay with me a while longer, I’ll see you there
safely.” If staying with him any length of time was safe. The Prophet, Whitecloaks, and now maybe
Seanchan added in.
“I think you’re a good man,” Lini said suddenly. “I’m afraid we didn’t tell you the whole truth,
and maybe we should.”
“Lini, what are you saying?” Master Gill exclaimed, bounding to his feet. “I think the heat’s
getting to her,” he told Perrin. “And all the travel. She has strange fancies, sometimes. You know how
old folks can get. Hush, now, Lini!”

Lini slapped away the hand he was trying to put over her mouth. “You mind yourself, Basel Gill!
I’ll ‘old’ you! Maighdin was running from Tallanvor, in a manner of speaking, and he was chasing
her. We all were, four days now, and near killing us and the horses both. Well, it’s no wonder she
doesn’t know her own mind half the time; you men snarl up a woman’s wits so she can hardly think,
then you pretend you’ve done nothing at all. The lot of you ought to have your ears boxed on general
principle. The girl’s afraid of her own heart! Those two should be married, and the quicker the
better.”
Master Gill gaped at her, and Perrin was not sure his own mouth might not be hanging open. “I’m
not certain I understand what it is you want of me,” he said slowly, and the white-haired woman
leaped in before he was well finished.
“Don’t pretend to be dense. I won’t believe it in you for a moment. I can see you have more wits
than most men. That’s the worst habit you men have, making believe you don’t see what’s plain under
your noses.” What had happened to all those curtsies? Folding thin arms across her chest, she eyed
him sternly. “Well, if you must pretend, I’ll set it out for you. This Lord Dragon of yours does
whatever he wants, the way I hear. Your Prophet picks out people and marries them on the spot. Very
well; you snatch up Maighdin and Tallanvor and marry them. He’ll thank you, and so will she. When
her mind settles.”
Stunned, Perrin glanced at Master Gill, who shrugged and made a sickly grin. “If you will
forgive me,” Perrin told the frowning woman, “I have some matters I must see to.” He hurried away,
only looking back once. Lini was shaking a finger at Master Gill, berating him despite his protests.
The breeze was wrong for Perrin to hear what they were saying. In truth, he did not want to. They
were all crazy!
Berelain might have her two maids and her thief-catchers, but Faile had her own attendants, of a
sort. Close on twenty young Tairens and Cairhienin were sitting cross-legged near the tent, the women
in coats and breeches with swords belted on just like the men. None wore their hair longer than the
shoulder, and men and women both had it tied back with a ribbon, imitating the Aiel tail. Perrin
wondered where the rest were; they seldom strayed far from the sound of Faile’s voice. Not causing
trouble, he hoped. She had taken them under her wing to keep them out of trouble, she said, and the
Light knew they would have gotten into it, left back in Cairhien with a great lot of young fools just
like them. In Perrin’s opinion, the whole lashing of them needed a swift kick in the bottom to knock
some sense into them. Dueling, playing at ji’e’toh, pretending to be some sort of Aiel. Idiocy!
Lacile rose to her feet as Perrin came closer, a pale little woman with red ribbons pinned to her
lapels, small gold hoops in her ears, and a challenging stare that sometimes made the Two Rivers
men think she might like a kiss despite her sword. Right then, the challenge was stony hard. A moment
behind her, Arrela stood too, tall and dark, with her hair cut short as a Maiden’s and her clothes
plainer than most of the men’s. Unlike Lacile, Arrela made it clear she would as soon kiss a dog as
any man. The pair made as if to move in front of the tent, to block Perrin’s way, but a square-chinned
fellow in a puffy-sleeved coat barked an order and they sat again. Reluctantly. For that matter,
Parelean thumbed that block of a chin as though he might be reconsidering. He had worn a beard the
first time Perrin saw him—several of the Tairen men had had them—but Aiel did not wear beards.
Perrin muttered about foolishness under his breath. They were Faile’s to the bone, and the fact
that he was her husband meant little. Aram might be jealous of his attentions, yet Aram at least shared
his affections with Faile. He could feel the young idiots’ eyes on him as he strode inside. Faile would
skin him if she ever learned that he hoped they would keep her from trouble.
The tent was tall and spacious, with a flowered carpet for a floor and sparse furnishings that

folded for storage on a cart, most of them. The heavy stand-mirror certainly could not. Except for
brass-bound chests draped with embroidered cloths and doubling as extra tables, straight lines of
bright gilt decorated everything down to the washstand and its mirror. A dozen mirrored lamps made
the interior nearly as bright as outside, if considerably cooler, and there were even a pair of silk
hangings dangling from the roof poles, too ornate for Perrin’s taste. Too rigid, with the birds and
flowers marching in lines and angles. Dobraine had set them up to travel like Cairhienin nobles,
though Perrin had managed to “lose” the worst of it. The huge bed, for one, a ridiculous thing to travel
with. It had taken up almost a whole cart to itself.
Faile and Maighdin were sitting alone together, worked silver cups in hand. They had the air of
women feeling one another out, all smiles on the outside yet with a hint of sharpness to the eyes, a hint
of listening for something behind the words, and not a clue as to whether they would hug in the next
instant or draw knives. Well, he thought most women would not actually go as far as knives, but Faile
could. Maighdin appeared much less travel-worn than she had, washed and combed, the dust brushed
from her dress. A small mosaic-topped table between them held more cups and a tall sweating silver
pitcher that gave off the minty scent of herb tea. Both women looked around at his entrance, and for an
instant, they had almost exactly the same expression, coolly wondering who was barging in and not at
all pleased with the interruption. At least Faile softened hers immediately with a smile.
“Master Gill told me your story, Mistress Dorlain,” he said. “You’ve faced hard days, but you
can be sure you’re safe here till you decide to leave.” The woman murmured thanks over the rim of
her cup, but she smelled wary, and her eyes tried to read him like a book.
“Maighdin also told me their story, Perrin,” Faile said, “and I have an offer to make her.
Maighdin, you and your friends have had trying months behind, and you tell me of no prospects ahead.
Enter my service, all of you. You will still have to journey, but the circumstances will be much better.
I pay well, and I am not a harsh mistress.” Perrin voiced his approval immediately. If Faile wanted to
indulge her fancy for taking in strays, at least he wanted to help this lot, too. Maybe they would be
safer with him than wandering around alone at that.
Choking on her tea, Maighdin nearly dropped her cup. She blinked at Faile, dabbing at the damp
on her chin with a lace-edged linen handkerchief, and her chair creaked faintly as she turned,
strangely, to study Perrin. “I . . . thank you,” she said at last, slowly. “I think. . . .” Another moment’s
perusal of Perrin, and her voice picked up. “Yes, I thank you, and I accept your kind offer gratefully. I
must tell my companions.” Rising, she hesitated in setting her cup on the tray, then straightened only to
spread her skirts in a curtsy suitable for any palace. “I will try to give good service, my Lady,” she
said levelly. “May I withdraw?” At Faile’s assent, she curtsied again and backed away two steps
before turning to go! Perrin scratched his beard. Somebody else who would be bobbing at him every
time she turned around.
No sooner had the tentflap dropped behind Maighdin than Faile put her cup down and laughed,
drumming her heels on the carpet. “Oh, I like her, Perrin. She has spirit! I’ll wager she would have
singed your beard over those banners if I hadn’t saved you. Oh, yes. Spirit!”
Perrin grunted. Just what he needed; another woman to singe his beard. “I promised Master Gill
to look after them, Faile, but. . . . Can you guess what that Lini asked? She wanted me to marry
Maighdin to that fellow Tallanvor. Just stand them up and marry them whatever they said! She
claimed they want it.” He filled a silver cup with tea and dropped into the chair Maighdin had
vacated, ignoring its alarming groans under his sudden weight. “In any case, that nonsense is the least
of my worries. Master Gill says it was the Seanchan took Amador, and I believe him. Light! The
Seanchan!”

Faile tapped her fingertips together, staring across them at nothing. “That might be just the thing,”
she mused. “Most servants do better married than not. Perhaps I should arrange it. And for Breane,
too. The way she went running out of here to check on that big fellow as soon as her face was clean, I
suspect they should be already. There was a gleam in her eye. I won’t have that kind of behavior in
my servants, Perrin. It just leads to tears and recriminations and sulking. And Breane will be worse
than he is.”
Perrin stared at her. “Did you hear me?” he said slowly. “The Seanchan have captured Amador!
The Seanchan, Faile!”
She gave a start—she really had been thinking about marrying off those women!—then smiled at
him, amused. “Amador is a long way, yet, and if we do meet with these Seanchan, I’m sure you will
deal with them. After all, you taught me to perch on your wrist, didn’t you?” That was what she
claimed, though he had never seen any sign of it.
“They might be a touch more difficult than you were,” he said dryly, and she smiled again. She
smelled extremely pleased, for some reason. “I’m thinking about sending Grady or Neald to warn
Rand, no matter what he said.” She shook her head fiercely, smiles evaporating, but he pushed on. “If
I knew how to find him, I would. There has to be some way to get word to him without anyone
learning of it.” Rand had insisted on that more than he had on secrecy about Masema. Perrin had been
exiled from Rand’s presence, and no one was to know anything remained between them except
enmity.
“He knows, Perrin. I’m sure of it. Maighdin saw pigeoncotes everywhere in Amador, and
apparently the Seanchan didn’t look at them twice. By this time, any merchant who has business with
Amador has heard, and so has the White Tower. Believe me, Rand must have, too. You have to trust
that he knows best. In this, he does.” She was not always so certain of that.
“Maybe,” Perrin muttered irritably. He tried not to worry about Rand’s sanity, but Rand made
Perrin at his most suspicious look like a child skipping in a meadow. How much did Rand trust even
him? Rand kept things back, had plans he never let on.
Exhaling, Perrin settled back in the chair, gulped a swallow of tea. The truth of it was, mad or
sane, Rand was right. If the Forsaken caught a suspicion of what he was up to, or the White Tower
did, they would find some way to overturn the anvil on his feet. “At least I can give the Tower’s eyesand-ears less to talk about. This time, I’m burning that bloody banner.” And the Wolfhead, too. He
might have to play at being a lord, but he could do it without a bloody flag!
Faile’s full lips pursed judiciously, and she shook her head slightly. Slipping from her chair, she
knelt beside him, took his wrist in her hands. Perrin met her level gaze warily. When she looked at
him so intently, so seriously, she was about to tell him something important. That, or pull the wool
over his eyes and spin him around till he did not know front from back. Her scent told him nothing. He
tried to stop smelling her; it was all too easy to lose himself in that, and then she would pull the wool
over his eyes. One thing he had learned since marrying: a man needed all of his wits dealing with a
woman. Too often even that was not enough; women did what they wanted as surely as Aes Sedai.
“You might want to reconsider, husband,” she murmured. A tiny smile quirked her mouth as if
she once again knew what he was thinking. “I doubt anyone who’s seen us since we entered Ghealdan
knew what the Red Eagle is. Around a town the size of Bethal, some will, though. And the longer we
have to hunt for Masema, the greater the chance.”
He did not bother with saying that was all the more reason to get rid of the banner. Faile was no
fool, and she thought much faster than he. “Then why keep it,” he asked slowly, “when all it’ll do is
draw eyes to the idiot everybody will think is trying to pull Manetheren out of the grave?” Men had

tried that in the past, and women, too; the name of Manetheren carried powerful memories, and it was
convenient for anyone who wanted to start a rebellion.
“Because it will draw eyes.” She leaned toward him intently. “To a man trying to raise up
Manetheren again. Lesser folk will smile to your face, hope you ride on soon, and try to forget you as
soon as you do. As for the greater, they’ve too much in front of their faces right now to look twice
unless you pinch their noses. Compared to the Seanchan, or the Prophet, or the Whitecloaks, a man
trying to raise Manetheren is small turnips. And I think it’s safe to say the Tower won’t look twice
either, not now.” Her smile widened, and the light in her eyes said she was about to make her most
telling point. “But most important, no one will think that man is doing anything else.” Abruptly her
smile vanished; she stuck a finger against his nose, hard. “And don’t call yourself an idiot, Perrin
t’Bashere Aybara. Not even sideways, like that. You aren’t, and I do not like it.” Her scent was tiny
spikes, not true anger but definitely displeased.
Quicksilver. A kingfisher flashing by faster than thought. Certainly faster than his thoughts. It
would never have occurred to him to hide so . . . flagrantly. But he could see the sense. It was like
concealing the fact that you were a murderer by claiming to be a thief. Yet it might work.
Chuckling, he kissed her fingertip. “The banner stays,” he said. He supposed that meant the
Wolfhead did, too. Blood and bloody ashes! “Alliandre has to know the truth, though. If she thinks
Rand means to set me up as King of Manetheren and take her lands. . . .”
Faile rose so suddenly, turning away, that he was afraid he had made a mistake bringing up the
Queen. Alliandre could lead to Berelain all too easily, and Faile smelled . . . prickly. Wary. But what
she said, over her shoulder, was “Alliandre won’t be a bit of trouble for Perrin Goldeneyes. That
bird’s as good as netted, husband, so it’s time to put our minds on how to find Masema.” Kneeling
gracefully beside a small chest against the tent wall, the only chest without draperies, she lifted the
lid and began removing rolled maps.
Perrin hoped she was right about Alliandre, because he did not know what to do if she was
wrong. If only he were half what she thought him. Alliandre was a netted bird, the Seanchan would
fall over like dolls for Perrin Goldeneyes, and he would snatch up the Prophet and take him to Rand if
Masema had ten thousand men around him. Not for the first time he realized that however much her
anger hurt and confused him, it was her disappointment he feared. If he ever saw that in her eyes, it
would rip the heart out of his chest.
He knelt beside her and helped her spread out the largest map, covering the south of Ghealdan
and the north of Amadicia, and studied it as though Masema’s name would leap off the parchment at
him. He had more reason than Rand to want to succeed. Whatever else, he could not fail Faile.
Faile lay in the darkness, listening until she was sure that Perrin’s breath had the deep rhythm of
sleep, then slipped out from the blankets they shared. Rueful amusement touched her as she pulled her
linen nightdress up over her head. Did he really think she would not find out that he had hidden the
bed deep in a copse one morning while the carts were being loaded? Not that she minded; not a great
deal, at least. She was sure she had slept on the ground as often as he. She had pretended surprise, of
course, and made light of it. Anything else, and he would have apologized, perhaps even gone back to
fetch the bed. Managing a husband was an art, so her mother said. Had Deira ni Ghaline ever found it
so difficult?
Scuffing her bare feet into slippers, she shrugged into a silk robe, then hesitated, looking down at
Perrin. He would be able to see her clearly, if he woke, but to her, he was just a shadowed mound.
She wished her mother were there, now, to advise her. She loved Perrin with every fiber of her
being, and he confused every fiber. Actually understanding men was impossible, of course, but he

was so unlike anyone she had grown up with. He never swaggered, and instead of laughing at himself,
he was . . . modest. She had not believed a man could be modest! He insisted that only chance had
made him a leader, claimed he did not know how to lead, when men who met him were ready to
follow after an hour. He dismissed his own thinking as slow, when those slow, considering thoughts
saw so deeply that she had to dance a merry jig to keep any secrets at all. He was a wonderful man,
her curly-haired wolf. So strong. And so gentle. Sighing, she tiptoed from the tent. His ears had
caused her difficulties before.
The camp lay quiet beneath a gibbous moon that gave as much light in a cloudless sky as it
normally would have full, a brightness that washed out the stars. Some sort of night-bird cried shrilly,
then fell silent at an owl’s deep hoot. There was a small breeze, and for a wonder, it actually seemed
a little cool. Probably her imagination. The nights were cool only in comparison to the days.
Most of the men were asleep, dark humps among the shadows beneath the trees. A few remained
awake, talking around the handful of fires still burning. She made no effort to hide, but none noticed
her. Some appeared half asleep where they sat, heads nodding. If she had not known how well the
men on sentry duty would be keeping watch, she might have thought the camp could be surprised by a
herd of wild cattle. Of course, the Maidens would be on guard in the night, too. But it did not matter if
they saw her, either.
The high-wheeled carts made long, shadowed rows, the servants already snug and snoring
beneath. Most of the servants. One fire still crackled there. Maighdin and her friends sat around it.
Tallanvor was talking, gesturing fiercely, but only the other men seemed to be paying him any mind,
though he appeared to be addressing himself to Maighdin. That they had had better garb in their
bundles than those near rags was not surprising, but their former mistress must have had a very free
hand to give out silk to her people, and Maighdin wore finely cut silk indeed, in a muted blue. None
of the others was dressed so well, so perhaps Maighdin had been their lady’s favorite.
A twig snapped under Faile’s foot, and heads whipped around, Tallanvor starting to his feet,
half drawing his sword before he saw her gathering her robe in the moonlight. They were more alert
than the Two Rivers men behind her. For an instant the lot of them just stared at her; then Maighdin
rose gracefully and made a deep curtsy, and the others hastily followed her example with varying
degrees of skill. Only Maighdin and Balwer appeared at all at ease. A nervous smile split Gill’s
round face.
“Go on with what you were doing,” Faile told them kindly. “But don’t stay up too late; tomorrow
will be full.” She walked on, but when she glanced back, they were still standing, still peering after
her. Their travels must have made them wary as rabbits, always watching for a fox. She wondered
how well they would fit in. Over the next few weeks, she would be busy training them to her ways,
learning theirs. One was as important as the other for a well-run household. The time would have to
be found.
They did not stay long in her thoughts tonight. Soon she was beyond the carts, not quite out to
where Two Rivers men would be keeping sharp watch from up in the trees. Nothing larger than a
mouse would get by them unseen—even some of the Maidens had been spotted upon occasion—but
they were watching for anyone attempting to sneak in. Not for those who had a right to be there. In a
small moonlit clearing, her people were waiting.
Some of the men bowed, and Parelean nearly went to one knee before stopping himself. Several
women instinctively made curtsies that looked quite peculiar in men’s garb, then dropped their eyes
or shifted in embarrassment at realizing what they had done. The manners of the court had been bred
into them, though they tried very hard to adopt Aiel customs. What they believed were Aiel customs,

at least. Sometimes they horrified the Maidens with what they believed. Perrin called them fools, and
they were in some ways, but they had sworn fealty to her, these Cairhienin and Tairens—water oath,
they named it, copying the Aiel, trying to—and that made them hers. Among themselves they had taken
to calling their “society” Cha Faile, the Falcon’s Talon, though they had seen the necessity of keeping
that quiet. They were not fools in all ways. In fact, around the edges anyway, they were not too unlike
the young men and women she had grown up with.
Those she had sent off early that morning had just returned, for the women among them were still
changing out of the dresses they had worn of necessity. Even one woman dressed as a man would
have roused notice in Bethal, not to mention five. The clearing was a great flurry of skirts and shifts,
coats and shirts and breeches. The women made believe they did not mind being unclothed in front of
others, including men, since the Aiel apparently did not, but haste and labored breathing gave them the
lie. The men were all shifting feet and turning heads, torn between looking away decently and
watching, as they thought the Aiel did, while pretending they were not looking at half-dressed women.
Faile held her robe close over her nightdress; she could not have dressed further without waking
Perrin for sure, but she made no pretense at comfort. She was no Domani, to receive her retainers in
her bath.
“Forgive us for being late, my Lady Faile,” Selande panted, tugging her coat on. The accents of
Cairhien were sharp in the short woman’s voice. Even for a Cairhienin, she was not tall. She
managed a credible swagger, though, a suitable boldness in the tilt of her head and the set of her
shoulders. “We would have returned sooner, but the gate guards made a bother letting us out.”
“A bother?” Faile said sharply. If only she could have seen with her own eyes, on top of theirs;
if only Perrin had let her go instead of that trollop. No, she would not think about Berelain. It was not
Perrin’s fault. She repeated that to herself twenty times a day, like a prayer. But why was the man so
blind? “What kind of bother?” She drew a chagrined breath. Troubles with your husband should
never affect your tone with your vassals.
“Nothing of note, my Lady.” Selande buckled her sword belt and settled it on her hips. “They let
some fellows ahead of us drive their wagons through without a second look, but they were worried
about letting women go out into the night.” Some of the other women laughed. The five men who had
gone into Bethal stirred irritably, no doubt because they had not been thought enough protection. The
rest of Cha Faile made a thick semicircle behind those ten, watching Faile closely, listening closely.
Moonlight shadowed their faces.
“Tell me what you saw,” Faile commanded in a calmer tone. Much better.
Selande made her report concisely, and for all Faile’s wishes that she had gone herself, she had
to admit they had seen almost as much as she could have wished. The streets of Bethal were nearly
empty even at the busiest hours of the day. People stayed to their own homes as much as possible. A
little commerce trickled in and out, but few merchants ventured into this part of Ghealdan, and barely
enough food came in from the countryside to keep everyone fed. Most of the townspeople seemed
stunned, afraid of what lay outside the walls, sinking deeper and deeper into apathy and despair.
Everyone kept their mouths closed for fear of the Prophet’s spies, and their eyes as well, for fear of
being taken for spies. The Prophet had a deep effect. For instance, however many bandits roamed the
hills, cutpurses and footpads had vanished from Bethal. It was said the Prophet’s penalty for a thief
was to cut off the man’s hands. Though that did not seem to apply to his own people.
“The Queen tours the city every day, showing herself to keep spirits up,” Selande said, “but I do
not think it helps much. She is making a progress here in the south to remind people they have a
Queen; maybe she has had more success elsewhere. The Watch has been added to the wall guards,

and all but a handful of her soldiers, too. Perhaps it makes the townsfolk feel safer. Until she moves
on. Unlike everyone else, Alliandre herself apparently feels no fear the Prophet will come storming
over the walls. She walks alone in the gardens of Lord Telabin’s palace, morning and evening, and
keeps only a few soldiers, who spend most of their time in the kitchens. Everybody in the city seems
as concerned with food, with how long there will be enough, as they are with the Prophet. In truth, my
Lady, for all the guards on the walls, I think if Masema appeared at the gates alone, they might give
him the town.”
“They would,” Meralda put in contemptuously, buckling her own sword round her waist, “and
beg for mercy.” Dark and stocky, Meralda was as tall as Faile, but the Tairen woman ducked her
head at a frown from Selande and murmured an apology. There were no doubts who led Cha Faile,
after Faile herself.
She had been pleased there was no need to change the precedence they had established. Selande
was the brightest of them except perhaps for Parelean, and only Arrela and Camaille were quicker.
And Selande had something extra, a steadiness, as if she had already faced the worst fear in her life
and nothing could ever be that bad again. Of course, she wanted a scar like those some of the Maidens
had. Faile possessed several small scars, badges of honor most of them, but actually seeking one was
idiocy. At least the woman was not too very eager in the matter.
“We made a map, as you required, my Lady,” the diminutive woman finished with a last,
warning glance at Meralda. “We marked out Lord Telabin’s palace on the back as much as we could,
but I fear that is not much more than the gardens and stables.”
Faile did not try to make out the lines on the paper she unfolded in the moonlight. A pity she had
not been able to go herself; she could have mapped the interior, too. No. Done was done, as Perrin
liked to say. And it was enough. “You are certain no one searches wagons leaving the city?” Even in
the pale light, she could see confusion on many of the faces in front of her. None knew why she had
sent some of them into Bethal.
Selande did not look confused. “Yes, my Lady,” she said calmly. Quite bright, and more than
quick enough.
The wind gusted for a moment, rustling leaves on the trees, rustling dead leaves on the ground,
and Faile wished she had Perrin’s ears. His nose and eyes, too. It did not matter if anyone saw her
here with her retainers, but eavesdroppers would be something else. “You’ve done very well,
Selande. All of you have.” Perrin knew the dangers here, as real as any farther south; he knew, but
like most men, he thought with his heart as often as his head. A wife had to be practical, to keep her
husband out of trouble. That had been her mother’s very first piece of advice on married life. “At first
light, you will return to Bethal, and if you receive word from me, this is what you will do. . . .”
Even Selande’s eyes widened in shock as she went on, but no one murmured the slightest protest.
Faile would have been surprised if anyone had. Her instructions were to the point. There would be
some danger, but under the circumstances, not nearly what might have been.
“Are there any questions?” she said finally. “Does everyone understand?”
With one voice, Cha Faile answered. “We live to serve our Lady Faile.” And that meant they
would serve her beloved wolf, whether he wanted them to or not.
Maighdin shifted in her blankets on the hard ground, sleep eluding her. That was her name, now;
a new name for a new life. Maighdin, for her mother, and Dorlain, for a family on an estate that had
been hers. A new life for an old life gone, but ties of the heart could not be cut. And now. . . . Now. . .
.
A faint crackle of dead leaves brought her head up, and she watched a dim shape pass through

the trees. The Lady Faile, returning to her tent from wherever she had gone. A pleasant young woman,
kindhearted and well spoken. Whatever her husband’s stock, she almost certainly was nobly born. But
young. Inexperienced. That might be a help.
Maighdin let her head fall back on the cloak she had wadded up for a pillow. Light, what was
she doing here? Taking service as a lady’s maid! No. She would hold on to her confidence in herself,
at least. She could still find that. She could. If she dug deeply. Her breath caught at the sound of
footsteps close by.
Tallanvor knelt gracefully at her side. He was shirtless, moonlight gleaming on the smooth
muscles of his chest and shoulders, his face in shadows. A slight breeze ruffled his hair. “What
madness is this?” he asked softly. “Entering service? What are you up to? And don’t tell me that
nonsense about making a new life; I don’t believe it. No one does.”
She tried to turn away, but he laid a hand on her shoulder. He exerted no pressure, yet it stopped
her as surely as a halter. Light, please let her not tremble. The Light did not listen, but at least she
managed to keep her voice steady. “If you haven’t noticed, I must make my way in the world, now.
Better as a lady’s maid than a tavern maid. You may feel free to go on alone if service here doesn’t
suit.”
“You didn’t abdicate your wits or your pride when you gave up the throne,” he muttered. Burn
Lini for revealing that! “If you mean to pretend that you did, I suggest you avoid letting Lini get you
alone.” The man chuckled at her! He chuckled, oh, so richly! “She wants a word with Maighdin, and I
suspect she won’t be as gentle with Maighdin as she was with Morgase.”
Angrily she sat up, brushing his hand away. “Are you blind, and deaf as well? The Dragon
Reborn has plans for Elayne! Light, I wouldn’t like it if he simply knew her name! It must be more
than chance that brought me to one of his henchmen, Tallanvor. It has to be!”
“Burn me, I knew it must be that. I hoped I was wrong, but. . . .” He sounded as angry as she. He
had no right to be angry! “Elayne is safe in the White Tower, the Amyrlin Seat won’t let her anywhere
near a man who can channel, even if he is the Dragon Reborn—especially if he is!—and Maighdin
Dorlain can do nothing about the Amyrlin Seat, the Dragon Reborn, or the Lion Throne. All she can
do is get her neck snapped, or her throat cut, or—!”
“Maighdin Dorlain can watch!” she broke in, at least partly to stop that awful litany. “She can
listen! She can . . . !” Irritably, she trailed off. What could she do? Suddenly she realized she was
sitting there in a thin shift and hurriedly folded her blankets around her. The night actually seemed a
little cool. Or maybe the goose bumps on her skin were from Tallanvor’s unseen eyes on her. The
thought roused a flush in her cheeks she hoped he could not see. Luckily, it put a heat in her voice,
too. She was not a girl, to go blushing because a man looked at her! “I will do what I can, whatever
that is. The chance will come to learn something or do something that will help Elayne, and I will
take it!”
“A dangerous decision,” he told her calmly. She wished she could make out his face in the
darkness. Only to read his expression, of course. “You heard him threaten to hang anyone who looked
at him the wrong way. I can believe it, in a man with those eyes. Like a beast. I was surprised he let
that fellow go; I thought he’d rip his throat out! If he discovers who you are, who you used to be. . . .
Balwer might betray you. He never really explained why he helped us escape Amador. Maybe he
thought Queen Morgase would give him a new position. Now he knows there’s no chance of that, and
he might want to curry favor with his new master and mistress.”
“Are you afraid of Lord Perrin Goldeneyes?” she demanded contemptuously. Light, the man
frightened her! Those eyes belonged on a wolf. “Balwer knows enough to hold his tongue. Anything

he says will reflect on him; he came with me, after all. If you’re afraid, then ride on!”
“You always fling that in my face,” he sighed, settling back on his heels. She could not see his
eyes, but she could feel them. “Ride on if you wish, you say. Once, there was a soldier loved a queen
from afar, knowing it was hopeless, knowing he could never dare speak. Now the queen is gone, and
only a woman remains, and I hope. I burn with hope! If you want me to leave, Maighdin, say it. One
word. ‘Go!’ A simple word.”
She opened her mouth. A simple word, she thought. Light, it’s only one word! Why can’t I say
it! Light, please! For the second time that night, the Light failed to hear. She sat there huddled in her
blankets like a fool, her mouth open, her face growing hotter and hotter.
If he had chuckled again, she would have put her belt knife in him. If he had laughed, or given
any sign of triumph. . . . Instead, he leaned forward and gently kissed her eyes. She made a sound
deep in her throat; she could not seem to move. Wide-eyed, she watched him stand. He loomed in the
moonlight. She was a queen—she had been a queen—used to command, used to hard decisions in
hard times, but right then the pounding of her heart drummed thought from her head.
“Had you said ‘go,’ ” he told her, “I’d have buried hope, but I could never leave you.”
Not until he was back in his own blankets could she make herself lie down and draw hers
around her. She breathed as if she had been running. The night was cool; she was shivering, not
trembling. Tallanvor was too young. Too young! Worse, he was right. Burn him for that! A lady’s
maid could do nothing to affect events, and if the Dragon Reborn’s wolf-eyed killer learned that he
had Morgase of Andor in his hands, she could be used against Elayne instead of helping her. He had
no right to be right when she wanted him to be wrong! The illogic of that thought infuriated her. There
was a chance she might do some good! There had to be!
In the back of her head, a small voice laughed. You can’t forget that you’re Morgase Trakand ,
it told her scornfully, and even after she’s abdicated her throne, Queen Morgase can’t stop trying
her hand in the affairs of the mighty, no matter how much ruin she’s made of it so far. And she
can’t tell a man to go away, either, because she can’t stop thinking how strong his hands are, and
how his lips curve when he smiles, and—
Furious, she pulled the blanket over her head, trying to shut out the voice. She was not staying
because she could not walk away from power. As for Tallanvor. . . . She would set him firmly in his
place. This time she would! But. . . . What was his place, with a woman who was no longer a queen?
She tried to put him out of her mind and tried to ignore that mocking voice that would not be quiet, yet
when sleep finally came, she could still feel the pressure of his lips on her eyelids.

CHAPTER
9

Tangles

p errin woke before first light as usual, and as usual, Faile was already up and about. She
could make a mouse seem noisy when she wanted to, and he suspected that if he woke an hour
after lying down, she would still manage to be up first. The door-flaps were tied back, the side
panels raised a little at the bottom, and a stir of air rose through the venthole in the peak, enough
to create an illusion of coolness. Perrin actually shivered while searching for his shirt and
breeches. Well, it was supposed to be winter, even if the weather did not know it.
He dressed in the dark and scrubbed his teeth with salt, needing no lamps, and when he left the
tent, stamping his feet into his boots, Faile had her new servants gathered around her in the deep
grayness of early morning, some holding lighted lanterns. A lord’s daughter needed servants; he
should have arranged for it before this. There were Two Rivers folk in Caemlyn that Faile had
trained herself, but with the need for secrecy there had been no way to fetch them along. Master Gill
would want to go home as soon as possible, and Lamgwin and Breane with him, but maybe Maighdin
and Lini would stay.
Aram straightened from where he had been sitting cross-legged beside the tent, and waited
silently on Perrin. If Perrin had not stopped him, Aram would have slept across the entrance. This
morning his coat was striped red-and-white, though the white was a trifle dingy, and even here that
wolfhead-pommeled sword hilt rose over his shoulder. Perrin had left his axe in the tent, and grateful
to be rid of it. Tallanvor still wore his sword belted over his coat, but not Master Gill or the other
two.
Faile must have been watching, because no sooner did Perrin come out than she gestured toward
the tent, clearly issuing orders. Maighdin and Breane came bustling past him and Aram with lanterns,
their jaws set, smelling of determination for some reason. Neither curtsied, a pleasant surprise. Lini
did, a quick bend of the knee before she darted after the other two muttering about “knowing their
place.” Perrin suspected Lini was one of those women who saw her “place” as being in charge.
Come to think of it, most women did. That was the way of the world, it seemed, not just the Two
Rivers.
Tallanvor and Lamgwin followed close behind the women, and Lamgwin was as serious about
bowing as Tallanvor, who was almost grim. Perrin sighed and bowed back, and they both gave a

start, gaping at him. A curt shout from Lini jerked them into the tent.
With only a quickly flashed smile for him, Faile strode off toward the carts, talking alternately to
Basel Gill on one side of her and Sebban Balwer on the other. The men each held a lantern out to
light her way. Of course, a double handful of those idiots kept pace where they could hear if she
raised her voice, strutting and stroking sword hilts and staring about in the dimness as though they
expected an attack or hoped for one. Perrin tugged at his short beard. She always found plenty of
work to fill her hours, and nobody took it out of her hands. Nobody would dare.
Not so much as the first fingers of dawn showed on the horizon yet, but the Cairhienin were
beginning to stir around the carts, and moving more quickly the closer Faile came. By the time she
reached them, they appeared to be trotting, their lanterns bobbing and swinging in the dimness. The
Two Rivers men, used to farmers’ days, were already making breakfast, some laughing and
roughhousing around their cook fires, some grumping, but most getting the work done. A few tried to
stay in their blankets and were unceremoniously tumbled out. Grady and Neald were up, too, as
always off by themselves, shadows in black coats among the trees. Perrin could not recall seeing
them without those coats, always buttoned to the neck, always clean and unwrinkled come sunrise,
whatever they had looked like the night before. Stepping through the forms in unison, the pair were
practicing the sword as they did every morning. That was better than their evening practice, when
they would sit cross-legged, hands on knees, staring at some distant nothing. They never did anything
then that anyone could see, yet not a man in the camp but knew what they were about and kept as far
off as possible. Not even the Maidens would step into their line of sight then.
Something was missing, Perrin realized with a start. Faile always had one of the men meet him
first thing with a bowl of the thick porridge they breakfasted on, but it seemed she had been too busy
this morning. Brightening, he hurried toward the cook fires, hoping at least to be able to dip up his
own porridge for once. A small hope.
Flann Barstere, a lanky fellow with a dent in his chin, met him halfway and shoved a carved
bowl into his hands. Flann was from up toward Watch Hill, and Perrin did not know him well, but
they had been hunting together a time or two, and once Perrin had helped him dig one of his father’s
cows out of a boghole in the Waterwood. “The Lady Faile told me to bring this to you, Perrin,” Flann
said anxiously. “You won’t tell her I forgot, will you? You won’t tell? I found some honey, and I put
in a good dollop.” Perrin tried not to sigh. At least Flann had remembered his name.
Well, maybe he could not get away with doing the simplest chores for himself, but he was still
responsible for the men eating beneath the trees. Without him, they would be with their families,
getting ready for the day’s chores around the farm, milking cows and cutting firewood instead of
wondering whether they might have to kill or be killed before sunset. Gulping down the honeyed
porridge quickly, he told Aram to take his ease over breakfast, but the man looked so miserable that
he relented, so Aram followed as he made his way around the camp. The journey was not one Perrin
enjoyed.
Men put down their bowls when he approached, or even stood until he passed. He gritted his
teeth whenever somebody he had grown up with, or worse, a man who had sent him on errands as a
boy, called him Lord Perrin. Not everyone did, but too many. Far too many. After a time, he gave up
telling them to stop out of sheer weariness; all too often the reply was “Oh! Whatever you say, Lord
Perrin.” It was enough to make a man howl!
Despite that, he made himself pause to speak a word or two to every man. Mainly, though, he
kept his eyes open. And his nose. They all knew enough to keep their bows in good repair and tend
the fletching and points on their arrows, but some would wear the soles out of their boots or the

bottom out of their breeches without noticing, or let blisters fester because they could not be bothered
to do anything about them just yet. Several had the habit of picking up brandy when they could, and
two or three of those had no head for it at all. There had been a small village the day before reaching
Bethal that held no fewer than three inns.
It was very strange. Having Mistress Luhhan or his mother tell him he needed new boots or his
breeches mended had always been embarrassing, and he was sure he would have been irritated at the
same from anybody else, but from grizzled old Jondyn Barran on down, the Two Rivers men just said
“Why, right you are, Lord Perrin; I’ll see to it straightaway” or some such. He caught a number of
them grinning at one another when he moved on. And they smelled pleased! When he rooted a clay jar
of pear brandy out of Jori Congar’s saddlebags—a skinny fellow who ate twice as much as anyone
else and always looked as if he had not had a bite in a week, Jori was a good shot with a bow, but
given a chance he would drink until he could not stand, and he had light fingers besides—Jori gave
him a wide-eyed look and spread his hands as if he did not know where the jar had come from. But as
Perrin walked on, emptying the brandy onto the ground, Jori laughed, “You can’t put anything over on
Lord Perrin!” He sounded proud! Sometimes, Perrin thought he was the only sane person left.
Another thing, he noticed. One and all, they were very interested in what he did not say. Man
after man cast an eye toward the two banners that occasionally flapped atop their poles in a brief gust,
Red Wolfhead and Red Eagle. They eyed the banners and watched him, waiting for the order he had
given every time the things had come out since reaching Ghealdan. And often enough before that.
Except that he had said nothing yesterday, and he said nothing today, and he saw speculation
blooming on men’s faces. He left behind clusters of men peering at the banners and at him, murmuring
excitedly among themselves. He did not try to listen. What would they say if he was wrong, if the
Whitecloaks or King Ailron decided they could look away from the Prophet and the Seanchan long
enough to snuff out a supposed rebellion? They were his responsibility, and he had already gotten too
many of them killed.
The sun was more than peeking above the horizon, spreading a sharp morning light, by the time
he finished, and over at the tent, Tallanvor and Lamgwin were lugging out chests under Lini’s
direction, while Maighdin and Breane appeared to be sorting the contents out on a broad patch of
dead grass, blankets and linens mainly, and long bright swaths of silk satin that had been intended to
drape the bed he had misplaced. Faile must have been inside, because that gaggle of idiots were
cooling their heels not far off. No carrying and hauling for them. Useful as rats in the barn.
Perrin thought about taking a look at Stayer and Stepper, but when he glanced through the trees at
the horselines, he was seen. No fewer than three of the farriers stepped out anxiously, watching him.
They were blocky men in leather aprons, alike as eggs in a basket, though Falton had only a fringe of
white around his head, Aemin was graying, and Jerasid had not yet come into his middle years. Perrin
growled at the sight of them. They would hover if he laid a hand on either horse, and goggle if he
lifted a hoof. The one time he had tried to change a worn shoe, on Stayer, all six farriers had darted
about grabbing up tools before he could touch them, nearly knocking the bay over in their rush to do
the work themselves.
“They’re afraid you don’t trust them,” Aram said suddenly. Perrin looked at him in surprise, and
Aram shifted his shoulders in his coat. “I’ve talked to them, some. They think if a lord tends his own
horses, it must be because he doesn’t trust them. You might send them off, with no way to get home.”
His tone said they were fools to think that, but he gave Perrin a sideways glance and shrugged again,
uncomfortably. “I think they’re embarrassed, too. If you don’t behave the way they think a lord should,
it reflects on them, as they see it.”

“Light!” Perrin muttered. Faile had said the same—about them being embarrassed, anyway—but
he had believed it just a lord’s daughter talking. Faile had grown up surrounded by servants, yet how
could a lady know the thoughts of a man who had to work for his bread? He frowned toward the
horselines. Five of the farriers stood together watching him, now. Embarrassed that he wanted to look
after his own horses, and upset that he did not want them pulling wool and scratching gravel all over
the place. “Do you think I ought to act like a fool in silk smallclothes?” he asked. Aram blinked, and
began studying his boots. “Light!” Perrin growled.
Spotting Basel Gill hurrying from the direction of the carts, Perrin moved to meet him. He did
not think he had done very well at making Gill feel at ease yesterday. The stout man was talking to
himself and once more mopping his head with a kerchief, sweating away in a rumpled dark gray coat.
The day’s heat was beginning to take hold already. He did not see Perrin until Perrin was nearly on
him, and then he gave a jump, stuffing the kerchief into a coat pocket and making a bow. He looked
curried and brushed fit for a feastday.
“Ah. My Lord Perrin. Your Lady told me to take a cart into Bethal. She says I’m to find you
some Two Rivers tabac, if I can, but I don’t know that’s possible. Two Rivers leaf has always been
dear, and trade isn’t what it was.”
“She’s sending you for tabac?” Perrin said, frowning. He supposed secrecy had gone down the
well, but still. “I bought three casks, two villages back. Enough for everybody.”
Gill shook his head firmly. “Not Two Rivers leaf, and your Lady says you like that above any
other. The Ghealdanin leaf will do for your men. I’m to be your shambayan, she called it, and keep
you and her supplied with what you need. Not much different from what I did running the Blessing,
really.” The similarity seemed to amuse him; his belly shook with quiet chuckles. “I have quite a list,
though I can’t say how much of it I’ll find. Good wine, herbs, fruit, candles and lamp oil, oilcloth and
wax, paper and ink, needles, pins, oh, all sorts of things. Tallanvor and Lamgwin and I are going,
with some of your Lady’s other retainers.”
His Lady’s other retainers. Tallanvor and Lamgwin were bringing out yet another chest for the
women to sort through. They had to pass by the squatting clump of young fools, who never offered to
lend a hand. In fact, the layabouts ignored them completely.
“You keep an eye on that lot,” Perrin cautioned. “If one of them starts any trouble—if he even
looks as if he will—you have Lamgwin crack his head.” And if it was one of the women? They were
just as likely, maybe more so. Perrin grunted. Faile’s “retainers” were going to tie his belly into
permanent knots yet. Too bad she could not be satisfied with the likes of Master Gill and Maighdin.
“You didn’t mention Balwer. Has he decided to go on alone?” Just then, a shift in the breeze brought
him Balwer’s scent, an alert smell very much at odds with the fellow’s almost desiccated exterior.
Even for so reedy a man, Balwer made surprisingly little noise on the dried leaves underfoot. In
a sparrow-brown coat, he offered a quick bow, and his tilted head added to the image of a bird. “I am
staying, my Lord,” he said cautiously. Or maybe that was just his manner. “As your gracious Lady’s
secretary. And yours, if it pleases you.” He stepped closer, very nearly a hop. “I am well versed, my
Lord. I possess a good memory and write a good hand, and my Lord can be assured that whatever he
confides in me will never pass my lips to another. The ability to keep secrets is a primary skill of a
secretary. Don’t you have pressing duties for our new mistress, Master Gill?”
Gill frowned at Balwer, opened his mouth, then closed it with a snap. Spinning on his heel, he
trotted away toward the tent.
For a moment Balwer watched him go, head to one side, lips pursed thoughtfully. “I can offer
other services, as well, my Lord,” he said finally. “Knowledge. I overheard some of my Lord’s men

speaking, and I understand that my Lord may have had some . . . difficulties . . . with the Children of
the Light. A secretary learns many things. I know a surprising amount about the Children.”
“With any luck I can avoid Whitecloaks,” Perrin told him. “Better if you knew where the Prophet
is. Or the Seanchan.” He did not expect any of that, of course, but Balwer surprised him.
“I cannot be certain, of course, but I think the Seanchan have not spread far beyond Amador as
yet. Fact is difficult to sift from rumor, my Lord, but I keep my ears open. Of course, they do seem to
move with unexpected suddenness. A dangerous people, with large numbers of Taraboner soldiers. I
believe from Master Gill that my Lord knows of them, but I observed them closely in Amador, and
what I saw is at my Lord’s disposal. As to the Prophet, there are as many rumors concerning him as
the Seanchan, but I believe I can say reliably that he was recently at Abila, a largish town some forty
leagues south of here.” Balwer smiled thinly, a brief self-satisfied smile.
“How can you be so sure?” Perrin said slowly.
“As I said, my Lord, I keep my ears open. The Prophet reportedly closed a number of inns and
taverns, and tore down those he considered too disreputable. Several were mentioned, and by chance,
I happen to know there are inns of those names in Abila. I think there is little chance another town
would have inns with the same names.” He flashed another narrow smile. He certainly, smelled
pleased with himself.
Perrin scratched his beard thoughtfully. The man just happened to remember where some inns
that Masema supposedly had torn down were located. And if Masema turned out not to be there after
all, well, these days rumors sprouted like mushrooms after rain. Balwer sounded a man trying to build
up his own importance. “Thank you, Master Balwer. I’ll keep that to mind. If you hear any more, be
sure to tell me.” As he turned to go, the man caught his sleeve.
Balwer’s skinny fingers leaped away immediately, as though burned, and he made one of those
birdlike bows, dry-washing his hands. “Forgive me, my Lord. I hesitate to press, but do not take the
Whitecloaks too lightly. Avoiding them is wise, but it may not be possible. They are much closer than
the Seanchan. Eamon Valda, the new Lord Captain Commander, led most of their numbers toward
northern Amadicia before Amador fell. He was hunting the Prophet, also, my Lord. Valda is a
dangerous man, and Rhadam Asunawa, the Grand Inquisitor, makes Valda seem pleasant. And I fear
neither has any love for your own Lord. Forgive me.” He bowed again, hesitated, then went on
smoothly. “If I may say so, my Lord’s display of Manetheren’s banner is inspired. My Lord will be
more than a match for Valda and Asunawa, if he takes care.”
Watching him bow himself away, Perrin thought he knew part of Balwer’s story now. Clearly,
he also had run afoul of the Whitecloaks. That could take no more than being on the same street with
them, a frown at the wrong time, but it seemed Balwer had a grudge. A sharp mind, too, seeing right
away about the Red Eagle. And a sharp tongue with Master Gill.
Gill was on his knees beside Maighdin, talking rapidly despite Lini’s effort to hush him.
Maighdin had turned to stare after Balwer as the fellow hurried through the trees toward the carts, but
now and then her gaze swung to Perrin. The rest of them clustered close to her, peering now at
Balwer, now at Perrin. If he had ever seen a group of people worried about what somebody else had
said, it was they. But what were they worried he might have heard? Backbiting, probably. Tales of
resentments and misdeeds, real or imagined. People cooped up together tended to start pecking at one
another. If that was it, maybe he could put a stop before somebody drew blood. Tallanvor was
fondling his sword hilt again! What did Faile intend to do with the fellow?
“Aram, I want you to go talk to Tallanvor and that lot. Tell them what Balwer said to me. Just
slide it into the talk, but tell everything.” That should soothe fears of tale-bearing. Faile said servants

needed to be made to feel at home. “Make friends with them if you can, Aram. But if you decide to
moon over one of the women, be sure it’s Lini. The other two are taken.”
The man had a smooth tongue for any pretty woman, but he managed to look surprised and
offended, both. “As you wish, Lord Perrin,” he muttered sulkily. “I’ll catch you up quickly.”
“I will be over with the Aiel.”
Aram blinked. “Ah. Yes. Well, it might take a while, at that, if I’m to make friends with them.
They don’t look like they much want friends, to me.” This from a fellow who stared suspiciously at
anyone except Faile who came near Perrin and never smiled for anyone not wearing a skirt.
Nevertheless, he went over and squatted on his heels where he could speak to Gill and the
others. Even from a distance their standoffishness was plain. They continued with their work, only
now and then saying a word to Aram, and they looked at each other as often as at him. Skittish as
green quail in summer, when the foxes were teaching the cubs to hunt. But at least they were talking.
Perrin wondered what mischief Aram had gotten up to with the Aiel—there did not seem to have
been any time for it!—but he did not wonder long. Any serious trouble with Aiel usually meant
someone dead, and not the Aiel. In truth, he was not so eager to meet the Wise Ones himself. He
walked around the curve of the hill, but instead of climbing the slope, his feet carried him all the way
to the Mayeners. He had stayed away from their camp as much as possible, too, and not simply
because of Berelain. There were disadvantages to having too keen a nose.
Fortunately, a freshening breeze was carrying most of the stink away, though it did little for the
heat. Sweat rolled down the faces of the mounted sentries in their red armor. At the sight of him, they
sat up even more rigidly in their saddles, which was saying something. Where the Two Rivers men
rode like fellows heading out to the fields, the Mayeners usually were statues on horseback. They
could fight, though. The Light send there was no need.
Havien Nurelle came running, buttoning up his coat, before Perrin was well past the sentries.
The dozen or so other officers followed at Nurelle’s heels, all coated and some fastening the straps of
their red breastplates. Two or three carried helmets with thin red plumes tucked under their arms.
Most were years older than Nurelle, some twice his age, graying men with hard, scarred faces, but
Nurelle’s reward for helping to rescue Rand had been to be named Gallenne’s second, his First
Lieutenant, they called it.
“The First hasn’t returned, yet, Lord Perrin,” Nurelle said, making a bow mirrored by the others.
A tall slender man, he did not look as young as he had before Dumai’s Wells. There was an edge to
his eyes, which had seen more blood than most veterans of twenty battles. But if his face was harder,
there was still an eagerness to please in his scent. To Havien Nurelle, Perrin Aybara was a man who
could fly or walk on water as he chose. “The morning patrols saw nothing, those that are back. I
would have reported, otherwise.”
“Of course,” Perrin told him. “I . . . just wanted to look about a bit.”
He simply meant to walk around until he could work up his nerve to face the Wise Ones, but the
young Mayener followed him with the rest of the officers, anxiously watching for Lord Perrin to find
some flaw in the Winged Guards, wincing whenever they came on bare-chested men tossing dice on a
blanket or some fellow snoring away with the sun on the climb. He need not have bothered; to Perrin,
the camp looked laid out with a plumb line and level. Each man had his blankets, and his saddle for a
pillow, not more than two paces from where his horse was tied to one of the long ropes drooping
between chest-high poles set upright in the ground. A cook fire stood every twenty paces, with lances
stacked in steel-tipped cones between. The whole made a sort of box around five peaked tents, one
striped gold-and-blue and larger than the other four combined. All very different from the Two Rivers

men’s every-which-way arrangement.
Perrin walked along briskly, trying not to look too much a fool. He was not sure how much
success he was having. He itched to stop and look over a horse or two—just to be able to pick up a
hoof without somebody practically fainting—but mindful of what Aram had said, he kept his hands to
himself. Everyone seemed as startled as Nurelle at his pace. Tough-eyed bannermen chivvied men to
their feet only to have Perrin stride by with a nod before they were all upright. A puzzled murmur
trailed in the air behind him, and his ears caught a few comments about officers, lords in particular,
that he was just as glad Nurelle and the others missed. Finally, he found himself on the verge of the
camp, staring up the brushy slope toward the Wise Ones’ tents. Only a few of the Maidens were
visible among the scattered trees up there, and some of the gai’shain.
“Lord Perrin,” Nurelle said hesitantly. “The Aes Sedai. . . . He stepped closer and lowered his
voice to a hoarse whisper. “I know they swore to the Lord Dragon, and. . . . I’ve seen things, Lord
Perrin. They do camp chores! Aes Sedai! This morning, Masuri and Seonid came down to fetch
water! And yesterday, after you returned. . . . Yesterday, I thought I heard someone up there . . . crying
out. It couldn’t have been one of the sisters, of course,” he added hurriedly, and laughed to show how
ridiculous the idea was, a very shaky laugh. “You. . . . You will see that everything is . . . all right . . .
with them?” He had ridden into forty thousand Shaido leading two hundred lancers, but talking about
this had him hunching his shoulders and shifting his feet. Of course, he had ridden into forty thousand
Shaido because an Aes Sedai wanted him to.
“I’ll do what I can,” Perrin muttered. Maybe matters were worse than he had thought. Now he
had to stop them getting worse still. If he could. He would rather have faced the Shaido again.
Nurelle nodded as though Perrin had promised all he asked and more. “That is well, then,” he
said, sounding relieved. Casting sideways glances at Perrin, he worked himself up to say something
else, but apparently this was not so touchy as the Aes Sedai. “I heard that you let the Red Eagle stay.”.
Perrin very nearly jumped. Even for just around the hill, news had traveled fast. “It seemed the
thing to do,” he said slowly. Berelain would have to know the truth, yet if too many knew, that truth
would spread from the next village they passed, the next farm. “This used to be part of Manetheren,”
he added, as if Nurelle did not know that perfectly well. Truth! He had gotten so he could bend truth
like an Aes Sedai, and to men on his side. “Not the first time that flag’s been raised around here, I’ll
warrant, but none of those fellows had the Dragon Reborn behind him.” And if that did not set the
necessary seeds, he did not know how to plow a furrow.
Abruptly he realized that what seemed every last one of the Winged Guards was watching him
with their officers. No doubt wondering what he was saying, after all but running through that way.
Even the lean balding old soldier Gallenne called his dogrobber had come out to stare, and
Berelain’s maids, a pair of plump plain-faced women garbed to match their mistress’s tent. Perrin
had hardly seen a thing, but he knew he had to give some sort of praise.
Raising his voice enough to carry, he said, “The Winged Guards will do Mayene proud if we
ever face another Dumai’s Wells.” Those were the first words that came to mind, but he winced at
saying them.
To his shock, shouting rose straightaway among the soldiers, cheering, “Perrin Goldeneyes!” and
“Mayene for Goldeneyes!” and “Goldeneyes and Manetheren!” Men danced and capered, and some
snatched lances from the stacks to shake them so the red streamers waved in the breeze. Grizzled
bannermen watched them with arms folded, nodding approval. Nurelle beamed, and not only him.
Officers with gray in their hair and scars on their faces grinned like boys praised at their lessons.
Light, he was the only sane man left! He prayed never to see another battle!

Wondering whether this was going to cause trouble with Berelain, he made his goodbyes with
Nurelle and the others and tramped up the slope through dead or dying brush, none of it waist-high.
Brown weeds crackled beneath his boots. Shouting still filled the Mayener camp. Even after she
learned the truth, the First might not be pleased to have her soldiers cheering him this way. Of course,
that could have good points. Maybe she would be angry enough to stop pestering him.
Short of the crest, he paused, listening to the cheers finally fade away. No one was going to
cheer him here. All of the side flaps were down on the Wise Ones’ low gray-brown tents, closing
them in. Only a few of the Maidens were in sight, now. Squatting easily on their heels beneath a
leatherleaf that still showed some green, they eyed him curiously. Their hands moved quickly in that
way they had of talking among themselves with signs. After a moment Sulin rose, shifting her heavy
belt knife, and strode in his direction, a tall, wiry woman with a pink scar across her sun-dark cheek.
She glanced back down the way he had come and seemed relieved that he was alone, though it was
often hard to tell with Aiel.
“This is good, Perrin Aybara,” she said quietly. “The Wise Ones have not been pleased that you
make them come to you. Only a fool displeases Wise Ones, and I have not taken you for a fool.”
Perrin scrubbed at his beard. He had been keeping clear of the Wise Ones—and the Aes Sedai
—as much as possible, but he had had no intention of forcing them to come to him. He just found their
company uncomfortable. To put it mildly. “Well, I need to see Edarra now,” he told her. “About the
Aes Sedai.”
“Perhaps I was mistaken after all,” Sulin said dryly. “But I will tell her.” Turning, she paused.
“Tell me something. Teryl Wynter and Furen Alharra are close to Seonid Traighan—like firstbrothers with a first-sister; she does not like men as men—yet they offered to take her punishment for
her. How could they shame her so?”
He opened his mouth, but nothing came out. A pair of gai’shain appeared from the reverse
slope, each leading two of the Aiel’s pack mules; the white-robed men passed within a few paces,
heading down toward the stream. He could not be sure, but he thought both were Shaido. The pair
kept their eyes meekly down, barely looking up enough to see where they were going. They had had
every opportunity to run away, doing chores like that without anyone to watch. A peculiar people.
“I see you are shocked, too,” Sulin said. “I had hoped you could explain. I will tell Edarra.” As
she started for the tents, she added over her shoulder, “You wetlanders are very strange, Perrin
Aybara.”
Perrin frowned after her, and when she vanished into one of the tents, he turned to frown at the
two gai’shain leading the horses to water. Wetlanders were strange? Light! So Nurelle had been
right in what he heard. It was beyond time to stick his nose into what was going on between the Wise
Ones and the Aes Sedai. He should have before this. He wished he did not think it would be the same
as sticking his nose into a hornet’s nest.
It seemed to take a long time for Sulin to reappear, and she did little to help his mood when she
did. Holding the tentflap for him, she flicked his belt knife contemptuously with a finger as he ducked
through. “You should be better armed for this dance, Perrin Aybara,” she said.
Inside, he was surprised to find all six Wise Ones sitting cross-legged on colorful tasseled
cushions, their shawls tied around their waists and their skirts making carefully arranged fans across
the layered rugs. He had hoped for just Edarra. None looked to be more than four or five years older
than he, some no older at all, yet somehow they always made him feel as if he were facing the oldest
members of the Women’s Circle, the ones who had spent years learning to sniff out whatever you
wanted to hide. Separating one woman’s scent from another’s was all but impossible, but he hardly

needed to. Six sets of eyes latched on to him, from Janina’s pale sky blue to Marline’s purple
twilight, not to mention Nevarin’s sharp green. Every eye could have been a skewer.
Edarra brusquely motioned him to take a cushion himself, which he did with gratitude, though it
put him facing them all in a semicircle. Maybe Wise Ones had designed these tents, to make men bend
their necks if they wanted to stand upright. Strangely, it was cooler in the dim interior, but he still felt
like sweating. Maybe he could not pick one from another, yet these women smelled like wolves
studying a tethered goat. A square-faced gai’shain who was half again as big as he was knelt to offer
a golden cup of dark wine-punch on an elaborate silver tray. The Wise Ones already held mismatched
silver cups and goblets. Unsure what it meant that he was being offered gold—maybe nothing, yet
who could say, with Aiel?—Perrin took it cautiously. It gave off the scent of plums. The fellow
bowed meekly enough when Edarra clapped her hands, and bent himself out of the tent backward, but
the half-healed slash down his hard face had to date from Dumai’s Wells.
“Now that you are here,” Edarra said as soon as the tentflap dropped behind the gai’shain, “we
will explain again why you must kill the man called Masema Dagar.”
“We should not have to explain again,” Delora put in. Her hair and eyes were nearly the same
shade as Maighdin’s, but no one would call her pinched face pretty. Her manner was pure ice. “This
Masema Dagar is a danger to the Car’a’carn. He must die.”
“The dreamwalkers have told us, Perrin Aybara.” Carelle certainly was pretty, and though her
fiery hair and piercing eyes made her look as though she had a temper, she was always mild. For a
Wise One. And certainly not soft. “They have read the dream. The man must die.”
Perrin took a swallow of plum punch to gain a moment. Somehow, the punch was cool. It was
always the same with them. Rand had not mentioned any warning from the dreamwalkers. The first
time, Perrin had mentioned that. Only the once; they had thought he was casting doubt on their word,
and even Carelle had gone hot-eyed. Not that Perrin thought they would lie. Not exactly. He had not
caught them in one, anyway. But what they wanted for the future and what Rand wanted—what he
himself wanted, for that matter—might be very different things. Maybe it was Rand who was keeping
secrets. “If you could just give me some idea what this danger is,” he said, finally. “The Light knows,
Masema’s a madman, but he supports Rand. A fine thing, if I go around killing people on our side.
That will certainly convince people to join Rand.”
Sarcasm was lost on them. They looked at him, unblinking. “The man must die,” Edarra said at
last. “It is enough that three dreamwalkers have said so, and six Wise Ones tell you.” The same as
always. Maybe they did not know any more than that. And maybe he should get on with why he had
come.
“I want to talk about Seonid and Masuri,” he said, and six faces turned to frost. Light, these
women could stare down a stone! Setting the winecup beside him, he leaned toward them stubbornly.
“I’m supposed to show people Aes Sedai sworn to Rand.” He was supposed to show Masema,
actually, but this did seem a good time to mention that. “They aren’t going to be very cooperative if
you lot beat them! Light! They’re Aes Sedai! Instead of making them haul water, why don’t you learn
from them? They must know all sorts of things you don’t.” Too late, he bit his tongue. The Aiel
women did not take offense, though; not that it showed, anyway.
“They know some things we do not,” Delora told him firmly, “and we know some they do not.”
As firmly as a spearpoint in the ribs.
“We learn what there is to learn, Perrin Aybara,” Marline said calmly, combing nearly black
hair with her fingers. She was one of the few Aiel he had seen with such dark hair, and she often
toyed with it. “And we teach what there is to teach.”

“In any event,” Janina said, “it is none of your affair. Men do not interfere between Wise Ones
and apprentices.” She shook her head over his foolishness.
“You may stop listening outside and come in, Seonid Traighan,” Edarra said suddenly. Perrin
blinked in surprise, but none of the women batted an eye.
There was a moment of silence, then the tentflap twitched aside, and Seonid ducked inside,
kneeling quickly on the rugs. That vaunted Aes Sedai serenity was shattered in her. Her mouth was a
thin line, her eyes tight, her face red. She smelled of anger, frustration, and a dozen more emotions all
whirling about so quickly that Perrin could barely separate any out. “May I speak to him?” she asked
in a stiff voice.
“If you take care what you say,” Edarra told her. Sipping her wine, the Wise One watched over
the rim of her cup. A teacher watching a pupil? A hawk watching a mouse? Perrin could not be sure.
Except that Edarra was very sure of her place, whatever the pairing. So was Seonid. But that did not
carry over to him.
She twisted around to face him on her knees, back going straight, eyes heated. Anger raged in the
smell of her. “Whatever you know,” she said angrily, “whatever you think you know, you will
forget!” No, there was not a shred of serenity left in her. “Whatever is between the Wise Ones and us
is for us alone! You will stand aside, avert your eyes, and keep your mouth closed!”
Amazed, Perrin raked his fingers through his hair. “Light, you’re upset because I know you got a
switching?” he said incredulously. Well, he would have been, too, but not alongside the rest. “Don’t
you know these women would as soon cut your throat as look at you? Slit your throat and leave you
by the side of the road! Well, I promised myself I wouldn’t let that happen! I don’t like you, but I
promised to protect you from the Wise Ones, or the Asha’man, or Rand himself, so come down off
that high horse!” Realizing that he was shouting, he drew a deep, embarrassed breath and settled back
on his cushion, snatched up his winecup and took a long drink.
Seonid went stiffer by the word with indignation, and her lip curled well before he finished.
“You promised?” she sneered. “You think Aes Sedai need your protection? You—?”
“Enough,” Edarra said quietly, and Seonid’s jaw snapped shut, though her hands made whiteknuckled fists clutching her skirts.
“What makes you think we would kill her, Perrin Aybara?” Janina asked curiously. Aiel seldom
showed much on their faces, but the others frowned at him or looked with open incredulity.
“I know how you feel,” he replied slowly. “I’ve known since I saw you with the sisters after
Dumai’s Wells.” He was not about to explain that he had smelled their hatred, their contempt, every
time a Wise One looked at an Aes Sedai back then. He did not smell it now, but no one could
maintain that level of fury for long without bursting. That did not mean it was gone, only that it had
sunk deep, maybe into the bone.
Delora snorted, a sound like linen ripping. “First you say they must be coddled because you need
them, and now because they are Aes Sedai and you have promised to protect them. Which is truth,
Perrin Aybara?”
“Both.” Perrin met Delora’s hard gaze for a long moment, then eyed each of the others in turn.
“Both are true, and I mean both.”
The Wise Ones exchanged glances, the sort where every flicker of an eyelid held a hundred
words and no man could make out a one. Finally, in a shifting of necklaces and readjusting of tied
shawls, they appeared to reach agreement.
“We do not kill apprentices, Perrin Aybara,” Nevarin said. She sounded shocked at the idea.
“When Rand al’Thor asked us to apprentice them, perhaps he thought it was just to make them obey

us, but we do not speak empty words. They are apprentices, now.”
“They will remain so until five Wise Ones agree they are ready to be more,” Marline added,
sweeping her long hair over her shoulder. “And they are treated no differently than any others.”
Edarra nodded over her winecup. “Tell him the advice you would give him concerning Masema
Dagar, Seonid Traighan,” she said.
The kneeling woman had practically writhed during Nevarin and Marline’s short speeches,
gripping her skirt until Perrin thought the silk might rip, but she wasted no time complying with
Edarra’s instructions. “The Wise Ones are right, whatever their reasons. I do not say this because
they wish it.” She drew herself up again, smoothing her features with a visible effort. A touch of heat
still flared in her voice, though. “I saw the work of so-called Dragonsworn before I ever met Rand
al’Thor. Death and destruction, to no purpose. Even a faithful dog must be put down if it begins to
foam at the mouth.”
“Blood and ashes!” Perrin grumbled. “How can I even let you in sight of the man after that? You
swore fealty to Rand; you know that isn’t what he wants! What about that ‘thousands will die if you
fail’?” Light, if Masuri felt the same, then he had to put up with Aes Sedai and Wise Ones for nothing!
No, worse. He would have to guard Masema from them!
“Masuri knows Masema for rabid as well as I,” Seonid replied when he put the question to her.
All of her serenity had returned. She regarded him with a cool, unreadable face. Her scent was
sharply alert. Intent. As if he needed his nose, with her eyes fixed on his, big and dark and bottomless.
“I swore to serve the Dragon Reborn, and the best service I can give him now is to keep this animal
from him. Bad enough that rulers know Masema supports him; worse if they see him embrace the man.
And thousands will die if you fail—to get close enough to Masema to kill him.”
Perrin thought his head would spin. Again an Aes Sedai whirled words about like a top, made it
seem she had said black when she meant white. Then the Wise Ones added their bit.
“Masuri Sokawa,” Nevarin said calmly, “believes the rabid dog can be leashed and bound so he
may be used safely.” For an instant, Seonid looked as surprised as Perrin felt, but she recovered
quickly. Outside, she did; her scent was suddenly wary, as if she sensed a trap where she had not
expected one.
“She also wishes to fit you for a halter, Perrin Aybara,” Carelle added, even more casually.
“She thinks you must be bound also, to make you safe.” Nothing on her freckled face told whether she
agreed.
Edarra raised a hand toward Seonid. “You may go, now. You will not listen further, but you may
ask Gharadin again to let you Heal the wound on his face. Remember, if he still refuses, you must
accept it. He is gai’shain, not one of your wetlander servants.” She invested that last word with
depths of scorn.
Seonid stared icy augers at Perrin. She looked at the Wise Ones, her lips trembling on the brink
of speech. In the end, though, all she could do was go with as good a grace as she could muster.
Outwardly, that was considerable, an Aes Sedai being Aes Sedai fit to shame a queen. But the scent
she trailed behind her was frustration sharp enough to cut.
As soon as she was gone, the six Wise Ones focused on Perrin again.
“Now,” Edarra said, “you can explain to us why you would put a rabid animal next to the
Car’a’carn.”
“Only a fool obeys another’s command to push him over a cliff,” Nevarin said.
“You will not listen to us,” Janina said, “so we will listen to you. Speak, Perrin Aybara.”
Perrin considered making a break for the doorflaps. But if he did, he would leave behind one

Aes Sedai who might possibly be of some doubtful help, and another, along with six Wise Ones, who
were all set to ruin everything he had come to do. He put his winecup down again, and settled his
hands on his knees. He needed a clear head if he was to show these women he was no tethered goat.

CHAPTER

Changes

W hen Perrin left the Wise Ones’ tent, he considered removing his coat to see whether his
hide was still attached and whole. Not a tethered goat, maybe, but a stag with six she-wolves on
his heels, and he was unsure what fast feet had gained him. For certain, none of the Wise Ones
had changed her mind, and their promises not to take any action on their own had been vague at
best. About the Aes Sedai, there had been no promises, even foggy ones.
He looked for either of the sisters, and found Masuri. A narrow rope had been tied between two
trees and a fringed red-and-green rug draped over it. The slender Brown was flailing away with a
bent-wood beater, raising thin clouds of dust motes that floated glittering in the midmorning sun. Her
Warder, a compact man with dark receding hair, sat on a fallen tree trunk nearby, watching her
glumly. Rovair Kirklin normally had a ready grin, but it was buried deep today. Masuri caught sight
of Perrin, and with barely a pause in her rug-beating shot him a look of such frozen malevolence that
he sighed. And she was the one who thought as he did. As close to it as he was likely to find, anyway.
A red-tailed hawk passed overhead, riding rising currents of hot air from hill to hill without flapping
its outstretched wings. It would be very nice to soar away from all this. The iron in front of him, not
dreams of silver.
Nodding to Sulin and the Maidens, who might have taken root under that leatherleaf, Perrin
turned to go, and stopped. Two men were climbing the hill, one an Aiel in the grays and browns and
greens of the cadin’sor, his cased bow on his back, a bristling quiver at his belt, and his spears and
round hide buckler in hand. Gaul was a friend, and the only man among the Aiel who did not wear
white. His companion, a head shorter in a broad-brimmed hat and coat and breeches of a plain dull
green, was no Aiel. He had a full quiver at his belt, too, and a knife even longer and heavier than the
Aielman’s, but he carried his bow, much shorter than a Two Rivers longbow though longer than the
horn bows of the Aiel. Despite his clothes, he did not have the look of a farmer, or a city man either.
Perhaps it was the graying hair tied at the nape of his neck and hanging to his waist, the beard fanning
across his chest, or perhaps just the way he moved, much like the man at his side, slipping around the
brush on the hill so that you were sure no twig snapped in his passing, no weeds broke under his foot.
Perrin had not seen him in what seemed a very long time.
Reaching the hilltop, Elyas Machera regarded Perrin, golden eyes shining faintly in the shadow

of his hat brim. His eyes had been that way years before Perrin’s; Elyas had introduced Perrin to the
wolves. He had been dressed in hides, then. “Good to see you again, boy,” he said quietly. Sweat
glistened on his face, but little more than on Gaul’s. “You give away that axe, finally? I didn’t think
you’d ever stop hating it.”
“I still do,” Perrin said just as quietly. A long time ago the onetime Warder had told him to keep
the axe until he stopped hating to use it. Light, but he still hated it! And he had added new reasons,
now. “What are you doing in this part of the world, Elyas? Where did Gaul find you?”
“He found me,” Gaul said. “I did not know he was behind me until he coughed.” He spoke
loudly enough to be heard by the Maidens, and the sudden stillness among them was solid as a touch.
Perrin expected at least a few cutting comments—Aiel humor could near draw blood, and the
Maidens seized any chance to dig at the green-eyed man—but instead, some of the women took up
spears and bucklers to rattle them together in approbation. Gaul nodded approval.
Elyas grunted ambiguously and tugged his hat down, yet he smelled pleased. The Aiel did not
approve of much this side of the Dragonwall. “I like to keep moving,” he told Perrin, “and I just
happened to be in Ghealdan when some mutual friends told me you were traveling with this parade.”
He did not name the mutual friends; it was unwise to speak openly about talking to wolves. “Told me
a lot of things. Told me they smell a change coming. They don’t know what. Maybe you do. I hear
you’ve been running with the Dragon Reborn.”
“I don’t know,” Perrin said slowly. A change? He had not thought to ask the wolves anything
more than where large groups of men were, so he could go around them. Even here in Ghealdan,
sometimes he felt blame among them for the wolves dead at Dumai’s Wells. What kind of change?
“Rand is surely changing things, but I couldn’t say what they mean. Light, the whole world is turning
somersaults, and never mind him.”
“All things change,” Gaul said dismissively. “Until we wake, the dream drifts on the wind.” For
a moment he studied Perrin and Elyas, comparing their eyes, Perrin was sure. He said nothing about
them, though; the Aiel seemed to take golden eyes as just one more peculiarity among wetlanders. “I
will leave you two to talk alone. Friends long separated need to talk by themselves. Sulin, are Chiad
and Bain about? I saw them hunting yesterday, and thought I might show them how to draw a bow
before one of them shoots herself.”
“I was surprised to see you come back today,” the white-haired woman replied. “They went out
to set snares for rabbits.” Laughter rippled through the Maidens, and fingers flickered rapidly in
handtalk.
Sighing, Gaul rolled his eyes ostentatiously. “In that case, I think I must go cut them loose.”
Almost as many Maidens laughed at that, including Sulin. “May you find shade this day,” he told
Perrin, a casual farewell between friends, but he clasped forearms formally with Elyas and said, “My
honor is yours, Elyas Machera.”
“Odd fellow,” Elyas murmured, watching Gaul lope back down the hill. “When I coughed, he
turned around ready to kill me, I think, then he just started laughing instead. You have any objections
to going somewhere else? I don’t know the sister who’s trying to murder that rug, but I don’t like
taking chances with Aes Sedai.” His eyes narrowed. “Gaul says there are three with you. You don’t
expect to be meeting up with any more, do you?”
“I hope not,” Perrin replied. Masuri was glancing their way between slashes with the beater; she
would learn about Elyas’ eyes soon enough and start trying to ferret out what else linked him to
Perrin. “Come on; it’s time I was back in my own camp anyway. Are you worried about meeting an
Aes Sedai who knows you?” Elyas’ days as a Warder had ended when it was learned he could talk to

wolves. Some sisters thought it a mark of the Dark One, and he had had to kill other Warders to get
away.
The older man waited until they were a dozen paces from the tents before he replied, and even
then, he spoke quietly, as though he suspected someone behind them might have ears as good as theirs.
“One who knows my name will be bad enough. Warders don’t run off often, boy. Most Aes Sedai
will free a man who really wants to go—most will—and anyway, she can track you down however
far you run if she decides to hunt. But any sister who finds a renegade will spend her idle moments
making him wish he’d never been born.” He shivered slightly. His smell was not fear, but anticipation
of pain. “Then she’ll turn him over to his own Aes Sedai to drive the lesson home. A man’s never
quite the same after that.” At the edge of the slope, he looked back. Masuri did seem to be trying to
kill the carpet, focusing all her rage on attempting to beat a hole through it. Elyas shivered again,
though. “Worse thing would be to run into Rina. I’d rather be caught in a forest fire with both legs
broken.”
“Rina’s your Aes Sedai? But how could you run into her? The bond lets you know where she
is.” That nudged something in Perrin’s memory, but whatever it was melted away at Elyas’ reply.
“A fair number can fuzz the bond, in a manner of speaking. Maybe they all can. You don’t know
much more than she’s still alive, and I know that anyway, because I haven’t gone crazy.” Elyas saw
the question on his face and barked a laugh. “Light, man, a sister’s flesh-and-blood, too. Most are.
Think about it. Would you want somebody inside your head while you cuddled up with a likely
wench? Sorry; I forgot you were married, now. No offense meant. I was surprised to hear you’d
married a Saldaean, though.”
“Surprised?” Perrin had never considered that about the Warder bond. Light! For that matter, he
had never really thought about Aes Sedai that way. It seemed about as possible as . . . as a man
talking to wolves. “Why surprised?” They started down through the trees on this side of the hill, not
hurrying and making little noise. Perrin had always been a good hunter, accustomed to the forests, and
Elyas hardly disturbed the leaves underfoot, gliding smoothly through the undergrowth without
shifting a branch. He might have slung his bow on his back now, but he still carried it ready. Elyas
was a wary man, especially around people.
“Why, because you’re a quiet sort, and I thought you’d marry somebody quiet, too. Well, you
know by now Saldaeans aren’t quiet. Except with strangers and outsiders. Set the sun on fire one
minute, and the next, it’s all blown away and forgotten. Make Arafellin look stolid and Domani
downright dull.” Elyas grinned suddenly. “I lived a year with a Saldaean, once, and Merya shouted
my ears off five days in the week, and maybe heaved the dishes at my head, too. Every time I thought
about leaving, though, she’d want to make up, and I never seemed to get to the door. In the end, she
left me. Said I was too restrained for her taste.” His rasping laugh was reminiscent, but he rubbed at a
faint, age-faded scar along his jaw reminiscently, too. It looked to have been made by a knife.
“Faile’s not like that.” It sounded like being married to Nynaeve! Nynaeve with sore teeth! “I
don’t mean she doesn’t get angry now and then,” he admitted reluctantly, “but she doesn’t shout and
throw things.” Well, she did not shout very often, and instead of flaring hot and vanishing, her anger
started hot and dragged on till it turned cold.
Elyas glanced at him sideways. “If I ever smelled a man trying to dodge hail. . . . You’ve been
giving her soft words all the time, haven’t you? Mild as milk-water and never lay your ears back?
Never raise your voice to her?”
“Of course not!” Perrin protested. “I love her! Why would I shout at her?”
Elyas began muttering under his breath, though Perrin could hear every word, of course. “Burn

me, a man wants to sit on a red adder, it’s his affair. Not my business if a man wants to warm his
hands when the roof’s on fire. It’s his life. Will he thank me? No, he bloody well won’t!”
“What are you going on about?” Perrin demanded. Catching Elyas’ arm, he pulled him to a stop
beneath a winterberry tree, its prickly leaves still mostly green. Little else nearby was, except for
some struggling creepers. They had come less than halfway down the hill. “Faile isn’t a red adder or
a roof on fire! Wait until you meet her before you start talking like you know her.”
Irritably, Elyas raked fingers through his long beard. “I know Saldaeans, boy. That year wasn’t
the only time I’ve been there. I’ve only ever met about five Saldaean women I’d call meek, or even
mild-mannered. No, she isn’t an adder; what she is is a leopard, I’ll wager. Don’t growl, burn you!
I’ll bet my boots she’d smile to hear me say it!”
Perrin opened his mouth angrily, then closed it again. He had not realized he was growling deep
in his throat. Faile would smile at being called a leopard. “You can’t be saying she wants me to shout
at her, Elyas.”
“Yes, I am. Most likely, anyway. Maybe she’s the sixth. Maybe. Just hear me out. Most women,
you raise your voice, and they go bulge-eyed or ice, and next thing you know, you’re arguing about
you being angry, never mind what put the ember down your back in the first place. Swallow your
tongue with a Saldaean, though, and to her, you’re saying she isn’t strong enough to stand up to you.
Insult her like that, and you’re lucky she doesn’t feed you your own gizzard for breakfast. She’s no
Far Madding wench, to expect a man to sit where she points and jump when she snaps her fingers.
She’s a leopard, and she expects her husband to be a leopard, too. Light! I don’t know what I’m
doing. Giving a man advice about his wife is a good way to get your innards spilled.”
It was Elyas’ turn to growl. He jerked his hat straight unnecessarily and looked around the slope
frowning, as though considering whether to vanish back into the forests, then poked a finger at Perrin.
“Look here. I always knew you were more than a stray, and putting what the wolves told me together
with you just happening to be heading toward this Prophet fellow, I thought maybe you could use a
friend to watch your back. Of course, the wolves didn’t mention you were leading those pretty
Mayener lancers. Neither did Gaul, till we saw them. If you’d like me to stay, I will. If not, there’s
plenty of the world I haven’t seen yet.”
“I can always use another friend, Elyas.” Could Faile really want him to shout? He had always
known he might hurt somebody if he was not careful, and he always tried to keep a tight rein on his
temper. Words could hurt as hard as fists, the wrong words, words you never meant, let loose in a
temper. It had to be impossible. It just stood to reason. No woman would stand for that, from her
husband or any man.
A bluefinch’s call brought Perrin’s head up, ears pricking. It was just at the edge of hearing even
for him, but a moment later the trill was repeated closer, then again, nearer still. Elyas cocked an
eyebrow at him; he would know the call of a Borderland bird. Perrin had learned it from some
Shienarans, Masema among them, and taught the Two Rivers men.
“We have visitors coming,” he told Elyas.
They came quickly, four riders at a fast canter, arriving before he and Elyas reached the bottom
of the hill. Berelain led the way, splashing across the stream with Annoura and Gallenne close behind
and a woman in a pale, hooded dust-cloak at her side. They swept right by the Mayener camp without
a glance, not drawing rein until they were in front of the red-and-white striped tent. Some of the
Cairhienin servants rushed to take bridles and hold stirrups, and Berelain and her companions were
inside before the dust of their arrival settled.
All in all, the arrival created quite a stir. A buzz rose among the Two Rivers men that Perrin

could only call anticipatory. The inevitable gathering of Faile’s young fools scratched their heads and
stared at the tent, chattering excitedly among themselves. Grady and Neald watched the tent through
the trees, too, now and then leaning together to talk though nobody was close enough to hear anything
they said.
“Looks like your visitors are more than casual,” Elyas said quietly. “Watch Gallenne; he could
be trouble.”
“You know him, Elyas? I’d like you to stay, but if you think he might tell one of the sisters who
you are. . . .” Perrin shrugged in resignation. “I might be able to stop Seonid and Masuri”—he thought
he could—“but I think Annoura will do whatever she wants.” And what did she really think about
Masema?
“Oh, Bertain Gallenne doesn’t know the likes of Elyas Machera,” Elyas replied with a wry grin.
“ ‘More fools know Jak Fool than Jak Fool knows.’ I know him, though. He won’t go against you or
behind your back, but Berelain has the brains between them. She’s kept Tear out of Mayene by
playing the Tairens against the Illianers since she was sixteen. Berelain knows how to maneuver; all
Gallenne knows is attack. He’s good at it, but he never sees anything else, and sometimes he doesn’t
stop to think.”
“I’d figured that out about both of them,” Perrin muttered. At least Berelain had brought a
messenger from Alliandre. She would not have come rushing in that way with a new maid. The only
question was why Alliandre’s reply needed a messenger. “I had best find out whether the news is
good, Elyas. Later, we’ll talk about what lies south. And you can meet Faile,” he added before turning
away.
“The Pit of Doom lies south,” the other man called after him, “or as close to it as I expected to
see below the Blight.” Perrin imagined he heard that faint thunder in the west again. Now, that would
be a pleasant change.
In the tent, Breane was carrying a silver tray about with a bowl of rose-scented water and cloths
for washing faces and hands, curtsying stiffly as she presented it. With even stiffer curtsies, Maighdin
was offering a tray holding cups of wine-punch—made with the last of the dried blueberries, by the
smell—while Lini folded the newcomer’s dust-cloak. There seemed something odd in the way Faile
and Berelain stood to either side of the new woman, and Annoura hovered behind them, all focused
on her. Somewhere in her middle years, with a cap of green net gathering dark hair that fell almost to
her waist, she might have been pretty if her nose had not been so long. And if she had not carried it so
high. Shorter than Faile or Berelain either one, she still managed to look down that nose at Perrin,
coolly examining him from hair to boots. She did not blink at sight of his eyes, although nearly
everyone did.
“Majesty,” Berelain pronounced in a formal voice as soon as Perrin entered, “may I present
Lord Perrin Aybara of the Two Rivers, in Andor, the personal friend and emissary of the Dragon
Reborn.” The long-nosed woman nodded carefully, coolly, and Berelain went on with scarcely a
pause. “Lord Aybara, give greetings and welcome to Alliandre Maritha Kigarin, Queen of Ghealdan,
Blessed of the Light, Defender of Garen’s Wall, who is pleased to receive you in person.” Gallenne,
standing near the tent wall, adjusted his eyepatch and raised his winecup to Perrin with a smile of
triumph.
For some reason Faile shot Berelain a hard look. Perrin’s mouth nearly dropped open. Alliandre
herself? He wondered whether he should kneel, then settled for a bow after too long a pause. Light!
He had no notion how to deal with a queen. Especially one who turned up out of the blue with no
escort, without a jewel in sight. Her dark green riding dress was plain wool, lacking a single stitch of

embroidery.
“After the recent news,” Alliandre said, “I thought I should come to you, Lord Aybara.” Her
voice was calm, her face smooth, her eyes aloof. And observant, or he was a Taren Ferry man. Best
to step warily till he knew how the path lay. “You may not have heard,” she continued, “but four days
ago Illian fell to the Dragon Reborn, blessed be his name in the Light. He has taken the Laurel Crown,
though I understand it is now called the Crown of Swords.”
Faile, taking a cup from Maighdin’s tray, whispered under her breath, “And seven days gone, the
Seanchan took Ebou Dar.” Even Maighdin did not notice.
If Perrin had not already taken hold of himself, he truly would have gaped. Why did Faile tell
him this way instead of waiting for it to come from the woman who must have told her? In a voice that
everyone could hear, he repeated her words. A hard voice, but that was the only way to keep it from
shaking. Ebou Dar, too? Light! And seven days ago? The day Grady and the others had seen the One
Power in the sky. Coincidence, maybe. But would he rather it had been the Forsaken?
Annoura frowned over her cup, pursing her lips, before he finished speaking, and Berelain gave
him a startled look that vanished quickly. They knew he had not known about Ebou Dar when they
rode into Bethal.
Alliandre merely nodded, every bit as self-possessed as the Gray. “You seem remarkably well
informed,” she said, coming closer to him. “I doubt the first rumors are reaching Jehannah with the
river trade, yet. I myself learned of it only a few days ago. Several of the merchants keep me abreast
of events. I believe,” she added dryly, “that they hope I can intercede for them with the Prophet of the
Lord Dragon, if such becomes necessary.”
At last he could pick out her scent, and his opinion of her changed, though not for the worse.
Outwardly, the Queen was all cool reserve, but uncertainty shot through with fear filled the smell of
her. He did not believe he could have held his face so calm had he felt that.
“Always best to know as much as you can,” he told her, half distracted. Burn me, he thought, I
have to let Rand know about this!
“In Saldaea we find merchants useful for information, too,” Faile said. Implying that was how
Perrin knew about Ebou Dar. “They seem to learn what happened a thousand miles off weeks before
the rumors begin.”
She did not look at Perrin, but he knew she spoke to him as much as Alliandre. Rand knew, she
was saying. And anyway, there was no way to get word to him in secret. Could Faile really want him
to . . . ? No, it was unthinkable. Blinking, he realized he had missed something Alliandre had said.
“Your pardon, Alliandre,” he said politely. “I was thinking about Rand—the Dragon Reborn.” Of
course it was unthinkable!
Everyone stared at him, even Lini and Maighdin and Breane. Annoura’s eyes had gone wide, and
Gallenne’s mouth hung open. Then it hit him. He had just called the Queen by name. He took a cup
from Maighdin’s tray, and she rose from her curtsy so quickly that she nearly knocked it from his
hand. Waving her away absently, he wiped his damp hand on his coat. He had to concentrate here, not
let his mind wander in nine directions. No matter what Elyas thought he knew, Faile would never. . . .
No! Concentrate!
Alliandre recovered her equilibrium quickly. In truth, she had appeared the least surprised of
anyone, and her scent never wavered. “I was saying that coming to you in secret seemed the wisest
course, Lord Aybara,” she said in that cool voice. “Lord Telabin believes I am keeping private in his
gardens, which I left by a seldom-used gate. Passing out of the city, I was Annoura Sedai’s maid.”
Brushing fingertips across one skirt of her riding dress, she gave a small laugh. Even that about her

was cool, so at odds with what his nose told him. “A number of my own soldiers saw me, but with
the hood of my cloak pulled up, none knew me.”
“Times being what they are, that probably was wisest,” Perrin said carefully. “But you will have
to come into the open sooner or later. One way or another.” Polite and to the point, that was the thing.
A queen would not want to waste time with a man who blathered. And he did not want to disappoint
Faile by acting the hayfoot again. “Why come at all? All you had to do was send a letter, or just tell
Berelain your answer. Will you declare for Rand or not? Either way, have no fear about getting back
to Bethal safely.” A good point, that. Whatever else frightened her, being here alone must.
Faile was watching him, pretending not to, sipping her punch and directing her smiles at
Alliandre, but he caught the quick flickers of her eyes in his direction. Berelain made no pretense,
watching quite openly, eyes slightly narrowed and never leaving his face. Annoura was just as intent,
just as thoughtful. Did they all believe he was going to trip over his own tongue again?
Instead of answering the important question, Alliandre said, “The First told me a great deal
about you, Lord Aybara, and about the Lord Dragon Reborn, blessed be his name in the Light.” That
last sounded by rote, an addition she no longer had to think about. “I cannot see him before I make my
decision, so I wished to see you, to take a measure of you. It’s possible to tell much about a man by
those he chooses to speak for him.” Tilting her face down toward the cup in her hands, she peered at
him through her lashes. From Berelain, that would have been flirtatious, but Alliandre was cautiously
watching a wolf sure as he was standing in front of her. “I also saw your banners,” she said quietly.
“The First did not mention them.”
Perrin scowled before he could stop himself. Berelain had told her a great deal about him? What
had she said? “The banners are meant to be seen.” Anger put a roughness in his voice that required
some effort to force down. Now, Berelain was a woman who needed shouting at. “Believe me, there
are no plans to set up Manetheren again.” There; his tone was as cool as Alliandre’s. “What is your
decision? Rand can have ten thousand soldiers, a hundred thousand, here in the blink of an eye, or
near enough.” And he might have to. The Seanchan in Amador and Ebou Dar? Light, how many were
they?
Alliandre sipped delicately at her wine-punch before speaking, and again she dodged the
question. “There are a thousand rumors, as you must know, and even the wildest is believable when
the Dragon is Reborn, strangers appear claiming to be Artur Hawkwing’s armies returned, and the
Tower itself is broken by rebellion.”
“A matter for Aes Sedai,” Annoura said sharply. “It concerns no one else.” Berelain flashed an
exasperated look at her, which she affected not to notice.
Alliandre flinched and turned her shoulder to the sister. Queen or not, no one wanted to hear that
tone from an Aes Sedai. “The world is turned upside down, Lord Aybara. Why, I’ve even had reports
of Aiel sacking a village right here in Ghealdan.” Abruptly Perrin realized there was more here than
anxiety over offending Aes Sedai. Alliandre watched him, waiting. But for what? Reassurance?
“The only Aiel in Ghealdan are with me,” he told her. “The Seanchan may be descendants of
Artur Hawkwing’s army, but Hawkwing is a thousand years dead. Rand dealt with them once already,
and he will again.” He remembered Falme as clearly as Dumai’s Wells, though he had tried
forgetting. Surely there had not been enough of them there to take Amador and Ebou Dar, even with
their damane. Balwer claimed they had Taraboner soldiers, too. “And it might cheer you to hear that
those rebel Aes Sedai support Rand. They will, soon, at least.” That was what Rand said, a handful
of Aes Sedai with nowhere to go except to him. Perrin was not so sure. Rumor in Ghealdan put an
army with those sisters. Of course, the same rumors counted more Aes Sedai in that handful than there

were in the world, but still. . . . Light, he wished someone would reassure him! “Why don’t we sit,”
he said. “I’ll answer any questions you have, to help you make your decision, but we might as well be
comfortable.” Drawing one of the folding chairs to him, he remembered at the last instant not to just
drop into it, but it creaked under him just the same.
Lini and the other two servants rushed about, pulling chairs into a circle with his, but none of the
other women moved toward them. Alliandre stood looking at him, and the rest looked at her. Except
for Gallenne, who merely poured himself another cup of punch from the silver pitcher.
It came to Perrin that Faile had not opened her mouth since speaking of the merchants. He was as
grateful for Berelain’s silence as he was that she had not decided to flutter her lashes at him in front
of the Queen, but he could have used some help from Faile right then. A little advice. Light, she knew
ten times what he did about what he should say and do here.
Wondering whether he should stand with the others, he set his wine-punch on one of the small
tables and asked her to speak to Alliandre. “If anyone can make her see the right way to go, you can,”
he said. Faile gave him a pleased smile, but held her tongue.
Abruptly Alliandre put out her cup to one side without looking, as if expecting a tray to be there.
One was, barely in time to catch the cup, and Maighdin, who held it, muttered something Perrin hoped
Faile had not heard. Faile was death on servants using that sort of language. He started to rise as
Alliandre approached him, but to his shock, she knelt gracefully in front of him, catching his hands
with hers. Before he knew what she was doing, she twisted so her hands were back-to-back between
his palms. She clung so hard her hands must have hurt; for sure, he was not certain he could loose
himself without hurting her.
“Under the Light,” she said firmly, looking up at him, “I, Alliandre Maritha Kigarin, pledge my
fealty and service to Lord Perrin Aybara of the Two Rivers, now and for all time, save that he
chooses to release me of his own will. My lands and throne are his, and I yield them to his hand. So I
do swear.”
For an instant there was a silence broken only by Gallenne’s gasp and the muted thud of his
winecup hitting the rug.
Then Perrin heard Faile, once more whispering so softly no one next to her could have made out
her words. “Under the Light, I do accept your pledge and will defend and protect you and yours
through battle’s wrack and winter’s blast and all that time may bring. The lands and throne of
Ghealdan, I give to you as my faithful vassal. Under the Light, I do accept. . . .” That must have been
the Saldaean manner of accepting. Thank the Light she was too busy concentrating on him to see
Berelain nodding at him furiously, urging the same. The pair of them looked almost as if they had
expected this! Annoura, though, with her mouth hanging open, appeared as stunned as he, like a fish
who had just seen the water vanish.
“Why?” he asked gently, ignoring Faile’s frustrated hiss and Berelain’s exasperated grunt alike.
Burn me, he thought, I’m a bloody blacksmith! Nobody swore fealty to blacksmiths. Queens did not
swear fealty to anyone! “I’ve been told I’m ta’veren; you might want to reconsider this in an hour.”
“I hope you are ta’veren, my Lord.” Alliandre laughed, but not in amusement, and gripped his
hands even more tightly, as though fearful he might pull away. “With all my heart, I hope it. I fear
nothing less will save Ghealdan. I all but reached this decision as soon as the First told me why you
are here, and meeting you only confirmed me in it. Ghealdan needs protection I cannot give, so duty
demands I find it. You can give it, my Lord, you and the Lord Dragon Reborn, blessed be his name in
the Light. In truth, I would swear directly to him if he were here, but you are his man. Swearing to
you, I also swear to him.” Drawing a deep breath, she forced out another word. “Please.” She

smelled desperate, now, and her eyes shone with fear.
Still, he hesitated. This was everything Rand could want and more, but Perrin Aybara was just a
blacksmith. He was! Could he still tell himself that if he did this thing? Alliandre stared up at him
pleadingly. Did ta’veren work on themselves, he wondered. “Under the Light, I, Perrin Aybara,
accept your pledge. . . .” His throat was dry by the time he finished the words Faile had whispered.
Too late to stop and think now.
With a gasp of relief, Alliandre kissed his hands. Perrin did not think he had ever been so
embarrassed in his life. Standing hurriedly, he drew her to her feet. And realized he did not know
what to do next. A proudly beaming Faile whispered no further hints. Berelain smiled, too, relief so
strong on her face she might have just been pulled from a fire.
He was sure Annoura would speak—Aes Sedai always had plenty to say, especially when it
gave an opportunity to take charge—but the Gray sister was holding out a winecup for Maighdin to
refill. Annoura watched him with an unreadable expression, and for that matter, so did Maighdin, so
much so that she continued tilting her pitcher until punch slopped over onto the Aes Sedai’s wrist. At
which Annoura gave a start, staring at the cup in her hand as though she had forgotten it was there.
Faile frowned, and Lini frowned even harder, and Maighdin scurried for a cloth to dry the sister’s
hand, all the while muttering under her breath again. Faile was going to have fits if she ever heard
those mutters.
Perrin knew he was taking too long. Alliandre licked her lips anxiously; she expected more, but
what? “Now that we’re done here, I have to find the Prophet next,” he said, and winced. Too abrupt.
He had no feel for dealing with nobles, much less queens. “I suppose you’ll want to get back to
Bethal before anyone learns you’re gone.”
“The last I heard,” Alliandre told him, “the Prophet of the Lord Dragon was in Abila. That’s a
largish town in Amadicia, perhaps forty leagues south of here.”
In spite of himself, Perrin frowned, though he smoothed his brow quickly. So Balwer had been
right. Right in one thing did not mean right in all, but it might be worthwhile hearing what the man had
to say about the Whitecloaks. And the Seanchan. How many Taraboners?
Faile glided to his side, laying a hand on his arm and directing a warm smile at Alliandre. “You
cannot mean to send her away now, my heart. Not when she has just arrived. Leave us to talk here out
of the sun before she must face the ride back. I know you have important matters to see to.”
He managed not to stare, with a little effort. What could be more important than the Queen of
Ghealdan? Certain sure, nothing anyone would let him lay hand to. Clearly she wanted to talk with
Alliandre without him. With luck, she would tell him why later. With luck, she would tell him all of
it. Elyas might think he knew Saldaeans, but Perrin had learned on his own that only a fool tried to
root out all of his wife’s secrets. Or let her know about those he had unearthed already.
Leaving Alliandre should no doubt involve as much ceremony as meeting her, but he managed a
credible leg and made his bow, asking her pardon for going off, and she curtsied deeply, murmuring
that he honored her too much, and that was that. Except for jerking his head at Gallenne to follow him.
He doubted that Faile would send him off and want that one to stay. What did she want to talk about
alone?
Outside, the one-eyed man gave Perrin a clap on the shoulder that would have staggered a
smaller man. “Burn me, I’ve never heard of the like! Now I can say I’ve seen ata’veren at work for
true. What did you want with me?” And what was he to say to that?
Just then, he heard shouting from the Mayener camp, the sound of arguing, loud enough that Two
Rivers men stood to peer through the trees, though the side of the hill hid everything.

“First let’s see what all that is about,” Perrin replied. That would give him time to think. About
what to say to Gallenne, and other things.
Faile waited a few moments after Perrin left before telling the servants that she and the others
would see to themselves. Maighdin was so busy staring at Alliandre that Lini had to pluck at her
sleeve before she moved. That would have to be handled later. Setting her cup down, Faile followed
the three women to the door of the tent as if hurrying them, but she paused there.
Perrin and Gallenne were striding off through the trees toward the Mayener camp. Good. Most
of Cha Faile was squatting not far off. Catching Parelean’s eye, she gestured low in front of her
waist, where no one behind her could see. A quick circular motion followed by a clenched fist.
Immediately the Tairens and Cairhien broke apart in groups of two or three and spread out. Far less
elaborate than Maiden handtalk, Cha Faile’s signals sufficed. In moments a scattered ring of her
people had surrounded the tent, apparently at random, talking idly or playing at cat’s cradle. But no
one would come nearer than twenty paces without her receiving warning before they reached the
threshold.
It was Perrin who worried her most. She had expected something momentous as soon as
Alliandre appeared in the flesh, if not what came, but he had been stunned by her vow. If he took it
into his head to return, to take another stab at making Alliandre feel comfortable in her decision. . . .
Oh, he did think with his heart when he should use his head. And with his head when he should use
his heart! Guilt pricked her at the thought.
“Peculiar servants you found by the side of the road,” Berelain said in tones of mock sympathy at
her side, and Faile gave a start. She had not heard the woman come up behind her. Lini and the others
were walking toward the carts, Lini shaking a finger at Maighdin, and Berelain shifted her gaze from
Faile to them. She kept her voice low, but the mocking tone remained. “The oldest at least seems to
know her duties instead of simply having heard about them, but Annoura tells me the youngest is a
wilder. Very weak, Annoura says, negligible, but wilders always cause problems. The others will
carry tales about her, if they know, and sooner or later, she will run away. Wilders always do, I hear.
That’s what comes of picking up your maids like stray dogs.”
“They suit me well enough,” Faile replied coolly. Still, a long conversation with Lini was
definitely needed. A wilder? Even if weak, that might prove useful. “I always thought you were fit for
hiring servants.” Berelain blinked, uncertain what that meant, and Faile carefully did not let her
satisfaction show. Turning away, she said, “Annoura, will you make us private with a ward against
listeners?”
There seemed little chance that Seonid or Masuri would find any opportunity to eavesdrop using
the Power—she was waiting for the explosion when Perrin found out just how tightly the Wise Ones
had that pair haltered—yet the Wise Ones themselves might have learned. Faile was sure Edarra and
the others were wringing Seonid and Masuri dry.
The Gray sister’s beaded braids clicked softly as she nodded. “It is done, Lady Faile,” she said,
and Berelain’s lips compressed briefly. Quite satisfying. The temerity of making the presentations
here in Faile’s own tent! She deserved more than having someone step between her and her advisor,
but it was satisfying.
Childishly satisfying, Faile admitted, when she should be focused on the matter at hand. She
almost bit her lip in aggravation. She did not doubt her husband’s love, but she could not treat
Berelain as the woman deserved, and that forced her, against her will, to play a game with Perrin too
often as the gaming board. And the prize, so Berelain believed. If only Perrin did not sometimes
behave as if he might be. Firmly she put all that out of her head. There was a wife’s work to be done

here. The practical side.
Alliandre glanced thoughtfully at Annoura when a ward was mentioned—she had to realize it
meant serious talk—but what she said was “Your husband is a formidable man, Lady Faile. I mean no
offense when I say his bluff exterior belies a shrewd mind. With Amadicia on our doorstep, we in
Ghealdan play Daes Dae’mar of necessity, but I do not think I have ever been danced so swiftly or so
deftly to a decision as your Lord did. The hint of a threat here, a frown there. A very formidable
man.”
This time hiding her smile took some effort on Faile’s part. These southlanders set a great store
by the Game of Houses, and she did not think Alliandre would appreciate learning that Perrin simply
said what he believed—too freely by half, at times—and people with devious minds saw calculation
in his honesty. “He spent some time in Cairhien,” she said. Let Alliandre make of that what she
would. “We can speak freely here, safe behind Annoura Sedai’s warding. It is plain you do not want
to return to Bethal yet. Is your oath to Perrin, and his to you, not enough to tie him to you?” Some here
in the south had peculiar ideas of what fealty entailed.
Berelain silently took a position to Faile’s right, and a moment later Annoura did the same on
her left, so that Alliandre found herself confronted by all three. It surprised Faile that the Aes Sedai
fell in with her plan without knowing what it was—without doubt Annoura had her own reasons, and
Faile would have given a pretty to know what they were—but she felt no surprise that Berelain did
so. One casual mocking sentence could spoil everything, especially about Perrin’s skill in the Great
Game, yet she was sure it would not come. In a way, that irritated her. Once she had despised
Berelain; she still hated her, deep and hot, but grudging respect had replaced contempt. The woman
knew when their “game” had to be put aside. If not for Perrin, Faile thought she might actually have
liked her! Briefly, to extinguish that hateful thought, she pictured herself shaving Berelain bald. She
was a jade and a trull! And not something Faile could allow to divert her now.
Alliandre studied each of the women in front of her in turn, but she gave no evidence of
nervousness. Taking up her winecup again, she sipped casually and spoke with sighs and rueful
smiles as if her words were not really as important as they sounded. “I mean to keep my oath, of
course, but you must understand that I hoped for more. Once your husband goes, I am left as I was.
Worse, perhaps, until some tangible aid comes from the Lord Dragon, blessed be his name in the
Light. The Prophet could ruin Bethal or even Jehannah itself as he did Samara, and I cannot stop him.
And if he somehow learns of my oath. . . . He says he has come to show us how to serve the Lord
Dragon in the Light, but he is the one who shows that way, and I cannot think he will be pleased with
anyone who finds another.”
“It is good that you will keep your oath,” Faile told her dryly. “If you want more of my husband,
perhaps you should do more. Perhaps you should accompany him when he goes south to meet the
Prophet. Of course, you will want your own soldiers with you, but I suggest no more than the First has
with her. Shall we sit?” Taking the chair Perrin had vacated, she motioned Berelain and Annoura to
those on either side, and only then gestured toward another for Alliandre.
The Queen sat slowly, staring wide-eyed at Faile, not nervous but astounded. “Why in the Light
would I do that?” she exclaimed. “Lady Faile, the Children of the Light will take any excuse to
increase their depredations in Ghealdan, and King Ailron might decide to send an army north as well.
It’s impossible!”
“The wife of your liege lord asks it of you, Alliandre,” Faile said firmly.
It didn’t seem possible that Alliandre’s eyes could widen farther, yet they did. She looked to
Annoura and found only imperturbable Aes Sedai calm looking back. “Of course,” she said after a

moment. Her voice was hollow. Swallowing, she added, “Of course, I will do as you . . . ask . . . my
Lady.”
Faile hid her relief behind a gracious nod of acceptance. She had expected Alliandre to balk.
That Alliandre could swear fealty without realizing what that meant—that she felt it necessary to say
that she intended to keep her oath!—had only confirmed Faile’s belief that the woman could not be
left behind. By all accounts, Alliandre had dealt with Masema by yielding to him. Slowly, to be sure,
with little other choice and only when she had to, yet submission could become a habit. Back in
Bethal, with nothing visible changed, how soon before she would decide to hedge with a warning to
Masema? She had felt the weight of her oath; now Faile could lighten her burden.
“I am happy that you will be accompanying us,” she said warmly. And truly, she was. “My
husband does not forget those who render him service. One such service would be to write to your
nobles, telling them that a man in the south has raised the banner of Manetheren.” Berelain’s head half
jerked around in surprise, and Annoura went so far as to blink.
“My Lady,” Alliandre said urgently, “half of them will send word to the Prophet as soon as they
receive my letter. They are terrified of him, and the Light alone knows what he might do.” Just the
response Faile had hoped for.
“Which is why you will write him also, saying that you have gathered a few soldiers to deal
with this man personally. After all, the Prophet of the Lord Dragon is too important to have to turn his
attention to such a minor matter.”
“Very good,” Annoura murmured. “No one will know who is who.”
Berelain laughed in delighted approval, burn her!
“My Lady,” Alliandre breathed, “I said that my Lord Perrin is formidable. May I add that his
wife is every bit as formidable?”
Faile tried not to bask too visibly. Now she had to send word to her people in Bethal. In a way,
she regretted that. Explaining to Perrin would have been more than difficult, but even he could not
have kept his temper if she had kidnapped the Queen of Ghealdan.
Most of the Winged Guards appeared to be gathered on the edge of their camp, surrounding ten
of their number on horseback. The absence of lances said the riders were scouts. The men afoot
milled and pushed, trying to get closer. Perrin thought he heard thunder again, not so distant, but it
only touched the edge of awareness.
As he prepared to push his way through, Gallenne roared, “Make way, you mangy hounds!”
Heads whipped around, and men wriggled sideways in the mass, opening a narrow path. Perrin
wondered what would happen if he called the Two Rivers men mangy hounds. Probably earn him a
punch in the nose. It might be worth a try.
Nurelle and the other officers were with the scouts. So were seven men afoot with their hands
tied behind them and lead ropes around their necks, all shuffling their feet and hunching their
shoulders and scowling defiance or fear or both. Their clothes were stiff with old filth, though some
had been fine once. Strangely, they smelled heavily of woodsmoke. For that matter, some of the
mounted soldiers had soot on their faces, and one or two seemed to be nursing burns. Aram stood
studying the prisoners, frowning slightly.
Gallenne took a stance with his feet apart and fists on his hips, his one eye doing as good a job
of glaring as most men’s two. “What happened?” he demanded. “My scouts are supposed to bring
back information, not rag-pickers!”
“I will let Ortis report, my Lord,” Nurelle said. “He was there. Squad-man Ortis!”
A soldier in his middle years scrambled down from his saddle to bow, gauntleted hand pressed

to heart. His helmet was plain, without the thin plumes and wings that were worked in the sides of
officers’ helmets. Beneath the rim, a livid burn stood out plainly on his face. The other cheek had a
scar that pulled up the corner of his mouth. “My Lord Gallenne, my Lord Aybara,” he said in a
gravelly voice. “We came on these turnip-eaters about two leagues to the west, my Lords. Burning a
farm, with the farm folk inside. A woman tried to get out a window, and one of these scum bashed her
head in. Knowing how Lord Aybara feels, we put a stop to it. We were too late to save anybody, but
we caught these seven. The rest got away.”
“People are often tempted to slide back into the Shadow,” one of the prisoners said suddenly.
“They must be reminded of the cost.” A tall, lean man with a stately air, his voice was smooth and
educated, but his coat was as dirty as any of the others, and he had not shaved in two or three days.
The Prophet did not seem to approve of wasting time on things like razors. Or washing. With his
hands bound and a rope around his neck, he glared at his captors without the least bit of fear. He was
all supercilious defiance. “Your soldiers do not impress me,” he said. “The Prophet of the Lord
Dragon, blessed be his name in the Light, has destroyed greater armies by far than your tag end. You
may kill us, but we will be avenged when the Prophet spills your blood on the ground. None of you
will survive us long. He will triumph in fire and in blood.” He finished on a ringing tone, his back
straight as an iron rod. Murmurs ran through the listening soldiers. They knew very well that Masema
had destroyed larger armies than theirs.
“Hang them,” Perrin said. Again, he heard that thunder.
Having given the order, he made himself watch. Despite the murmurs, there was no lack of ready
hands. Some of the prisoners began to weep as their lead ropes were thrown over tree limbs. A oncefat man whose wattles hung in folds shouted that he repented, that he would serve any master they
named. A bald-headed fellow who looked as tough as Lamgwin thrashed and screamed until the rope
cut off his howls. Only the smooth-voiced man did not kick or fight, even when the noose drew tight
on his neck. To the end he glared defiance.
“At least one of them knew how to die,” Gallenne growled as the last body went limp. He
frowned at the men decorating the trees as if regretting they had not put up more fight.
“If those people were serving the Shadow,” Aram began, then hesitated. “Forgive me, Lord
Perrin, but will the Lord Dragon approve of this?”
Perrin gave a start and stared at him, aghast. “Light, Aram, you heard what they did! Rand
would’ve put the ropes on their necks himself!” He thought Rand would have, hoped he would have.
Rand was fixed on welding the nations together before the Last Battle, and he had done little counting
of cost to do so.
Men’s heads jerked up as thunder pealed loud enough for all to hear, then closer, and again
closer still. A wind gusted, fell, rose again, tugging Perrin’s coat as it slashed this way and that.
Lightning forked in a cloudless sky. In the Mayener camp, horses whinnied and reared at their ties.
Thunder tolled repeatedly, and lightning writhed in silver-blue snakes, and beneath a burning sun, rain
fell, fat scattered drops that splashed fountains of dust where they hit bare ground. Perrin wiped one
from his cheek and peered at damp fingers in amazement.
In moments the storm was gone, thunder and lightning rolling on eastward. Thirsty ground
absorbed the raindrops that had fallen, the sun baked as fiercely as ever, and only flickering lights in
the sky and fading booms said that anything had happened. Soldiers stared at each other uncertainly.
Gallenne pried his fingers from the hilt of his sword with an obvious effort.
“This . . . this can’t be the Dark One’s work,” Aram said, and flinched. No one had ever seen a
natural storm like that. “It means the weather is changing, doesn’t it, Lord Perrin? The weather is

going to be right again?”
Perrin opened his mouth to tell the man not to call him that, but he closed it again with a sigh. “I
don’t know,” he said. What was it Gaul had said? “Everything changes, Aram.” He had just never
thought that he would have to change, too.

CHAPTER
11

Questions and an Oath

T he air in the huge stable smelled of old hay and horse dung. And blood, and burned flesh.
With all the doors closed, the air felt thick. Two lanterns gave little light, and shadows filled
most of the interior. In the long rows of stalls, horses whickered nervously. The man hanging by
his wrists from a roof beam gave a low moan, then a ragged cough. His head fell down on his
chest. He was a tall man, well-muscled, if rather the worse for wear.
Abruptly Sevanna realized that his chest no longer moved. The gem-studded rings on her fingers
glittered red and green as she gestured curtly to Rhiale.
The flame-haired woman pushed the man’s head up and thumbed back one eyelid, then pressed
an ear to his chest, careless of the still-smoldering splinters that peppered him. With a sound of
disgust, she straightened. “He is dead. We should have left this to the Maidens, Sevanna, or the Black
Eyes. I do not doubt we killed him by ignorance.”
Sevanna’s mouth tightened, and she shifted her shawl in a clatter of bracelets. They ran nearly to
her elbows, a noticeable weight in gold and ivory and gems, yet she would have worn every one she
owned if she could. None of the other women said anything. Putting prisoners to the question was not
the work of Wise Ones, but Rhiale knew why they had to do this themselves. The lone survivor of ten
mounted men who thought they could defeat twenty Maidens because they rode horses, the man had
also been the first Seanchan captured in the ten days since their arrival in this land.
“He would have lived if he had not fought the pain so hard, Rhiale,” Someryn said finally,
shaking her head. “A strong man for a wetlander, but he could not accept pain. Still, he told us much.”
Sevanna eyed her sideways, trying to see whether she hid sarcasm. As tall as most men,
Someryn wore more bracelets and necklaces than any woman there except Sevanna herself, layers of
firedrops and emeralds, rubies and sapphires, almost concealing a too-full bosom that otherwise
would have been half bared with her blouse undone almost to her skirt. Her shawl, tied around her
waist, hid nothing. At times it was difficult for Sevanna to tell whether Someryn was copying her or
competing with her.
“Much!” Meira exclaimed. In the light of the lantern she held, her long face was grimmer than
usual, though that hardly seemed possible. Meira could find the dark side of the noonday sun. “That
his people lie two days west in the city called Amador? We knew that. All he has told us are wild
tales. Artur Hawkwing! Bah! The Maidens should have kept him and done what was needed.”
“Would you . . . risk letting everyone learn too much too soon?” Sevanna bit her lip in vexation.

She had almost called them “you fools.” Too many already knew too much, in her opinion, Wise Ones
among them, but she could not risk offending these women. That knowledge grated on her! “The
people are frightened.” There was no need to hide her contempt for that, at least. What shocked her,
outraged her, was not that they were afraid, but how few made any effort to hide the fact. “Black
Eyes, or Stone Dogs, or even Maidens, would have talked of what he said. You know they would!
His lies would only have spread more fear.” They had to be lies. In Sevanna’s mind a sea was like
the lakes she had seen in the wetlands, but with its far side beyond sight. If hundreds of thousands
more of his people were coming, even from the other side of so large a body of water, the other
prisoners she had questioned would have known of them. And no prisoner was questioned without
her present.
Tion raised the second lantern and regarded her with unblinking gray eyes. Nearly a head shorter
than Someryn, Tion was still taller than Sevanna. And twice as wide. Her round face often appeared
placid, but thinking her so was a mistake. “They are right to fear,” she said in a stony voice. “I am
afraid, and take no shame in it. The Seanchan are many if they are no more than took Amador, and we
are few. You have your sept around you, Sevanna, but where is my sept? Your wetlander friend
Caddar and his tame Aes Sedai sent us through his holes in the air to die. Where are the rest of the
Shaido?”
Rhiale moved to stand defiantly beside Tion, and they were quickly joined by Alarys, even now
toying with her black hair to draw attention to it. Or perhaps it was to avoid meeting Sevanna’s eyes.
After a moment, a scowling Meira added herself to the cluster, and then Modarra. Modarra might
have been called slim if she were not even taller than Someryn; as it was, lean was the best that could
be said of her. Sevanna had thought Modarra as firmly in her grasp as any of the rings on her fingers.
As firmly in her grasp as. . . . Someryn looked at her and sighed, looked at the others. Slowly she
walked over to stand beside them.
Sevanna was left standing on the very edge of the lantern’s light. Of all the women tied to her by
the killing of Desaine, she trusted these most. Not that she trusted anyone very far, of course. But
Someryn and Modarra she had been sure were hers as tightly as if they had sworn water oath to
follow where she led. And now they dared face her with accusing eyes. Even Alarys looked up from
playing with her hair.
Sevanna met their stares with a cool smile just short of a sneer. Now, she decided, was not the
time to remind them of the crime that bound their fates together. Not the bludgeon, this time. “I
suspected Caddar might try to betray us,” she said instead. Rhiale’s blue eyes widened at the
admission, and Tion opened her mouth. Sevanna went on, not leaving them room to speak. “Would
you rather have remained in Kinslayer’s Dagger to be destroyed? To be hunted like animals by four
clans whose Wise Ones know how to make those holes without the traveling boxes? Instead, we are
in the heart of a rich, soft land. Richer even than the lands of the tree-killers. Look at what we have
taken in only ten days. How much more will we take in a wetlander city? You fear the Seanchan
because they have numbers? Remember that I brought every Shaido Wise One who can channel with
me.” That she could not channel herself seldom occurred to her, now. Soon that lack would be
remedied. “We are as strong as any force these wetlanders can send against us. Even if they do have
flying lizards.” She sniffed forcefully to show what she thought of those! None of them had seen one,
nor any of the scouts, but nearly every prisoner had been full of the ridiculous tales. “After we find
the other septs, we will take this land for our own. All of it! We will extract a tenfold repayment from
the Aes Sedai. And we will find Caddar and make him die screaming for mercy.”
That should have rallied them, restored their hearts as she had had to do before. Not one

woman’s face changed. Not one.
“And there is the Car’a’carn,” Tion said calmly. “Unless you have given up your plan to marry
him.”
“I have given up nothing,” Sevanna replied irritably. The man—and more important, the power
that came with him—would be hers someday. Somehow. Whatever it took. Smoothing her voice, she
went on. “Rand al’Thor is hardly of consequence now.” At least to these blind simpletons. With him
in her hands, anything would be possible for her. “I do not intend to stand here all day discussing my
bridal wreath. I have matters to see to that are important.”
As she stalked away from them through the gloom, toward the doors of the stable, an unpleasant
thought suddenly occurred to her. She was alone with these women. How far could she trust them,
now? Desaine’s death remained all too vivid in her mind; the Wise One had been . . . butchered . . .
using the One Power. By the women behind her, among others. The thought twisted her belly tight.
She listened for the faint rustle of straw that would announce feet following her and heard nothing.
Were they just standing there watching? She refused to look over her shoulder. Keeping the same
slow pace required only a little effort—she would not display fear and shame herself!—yet when she
pushed one of the tall doors open on its well-oiled hinges and stepped into bright midday light, she
could not stop from drawing a relieved breath.
Efalin was pacing outside, shoufa draped around her neck, bow cased on her back, spears and
buckler in hand. The gray-haired woman turned abruptly, the worry on her face fading only a little at
sight of Sevanna. The leader of all the Shaido Maidens, and she let her distress show! She was not
Jumai, but she had come with Sevanna using the excuse that Sevanna spoke as the chief until a new
chief of the Shaido could be chosen. Sevanna was sure that Efalin suspected that would never happen.
Efalin knew where the power lay. And when to keep her mouth closed.
“Bury him deeply and hide the grave,” Sevanna told her.
Efalin nodded, signaling the Maidens ringing the stable to their feet, and they vanished inside
behind her. Sevanna studied the building, with its sharp-peaked red roof and blue walls, then turned
to the field in front of it. A low stone fence with a single opening, right before the stable, enclosed a
circle of hard-packed dirt perhaps a hundred paces across. The wetlanders had used it for training
horses. Why it had been placed so far from everything else, surrounded by trees so tall that Sevanna
still sometimes stared at them, she had not thought to ask the former owners, but the isolation served
her purposes. The Maidens with Efalin were those who had captured the Seanchan. No one not here
knew he existed. Or would know. Were the other Wise Ones talking in there? About her? In front of
the Maidens? What were they saying? She would not wait on them or anyone!
They came out of the stable just as she started off toward the forest, Someryn and the others, and
followed her into the trees arguing among themselves about the Seanchan, and Caddar, and where the
rest of the Shaido had been sent. Not about her, but then, they would not where she could listen. What
she did hear made her grimace. There were over three hundred Wise Ones with the Jumai, and it was
the same whenever three or four started talking. Where were the rest of the septs, and had Caddar
been a spear hurled by Rand al’Thor, and how many Seanchan were there, and even did they really
ride lizards? Lizards! These women had been with her from the first. She had guided their feet step by
step, but they believed they had helped plan every move, believed they knew the destination. If she
was losing them now. . . .
The forest gave way to a huge clearing that could have swallowed the circle back at the stable
fifty times over, and Sevanna felt ill temper slipping away as she stopped to look. Low hills rose to
the north, and mountains a few leagues beyond them were capped with clouds, great masses of white

streaked with dark gray. She had never seen so many clouds in her life. Closer at hand, thousands of
Jumai went about the day’s work. The ring of hammer on anvil rose from blacksmiths, and sheep and
goats were being slaughtered for the evening meal, their bleating mixed with the laughter of the
children as they ran at play. Given more time to prepare for their flight from Kinslayer’s Dagger than
the other septs, the Jumai had brought the flocks gathered in Cairhien, and added to them here.
Many people had set up their tents, but there was no need. Colorful structures nearly filled the
clearing like a large wetlander village, tall barns and stables, a large forge and the squat roofs that
had sheltered servants, all painted red and blue, surrounding the great roof itself. The manor house
that was called, three floors high beneath a dark green tile roof, all of it a paler green trimmed with
yellow, atop a broad man-made stone hill ten paces tall. Jumai and gai’shain climbed the long ramp
that led to the great building’s door and walked the ornately carved balconies that ringed it.
The stone walls and palaces she had seen in Cairhien had not impressed her half so much. This
one was painted like a wagon of the Lost Ones, but even so, marvelous. She should have realized that
with so many trees, these people could afford to build anything of wood. Could no one but she see
how fat this land was? More white-clad gai’shain scurried about their tasks than any twenty septs
had ever had before, nearly half as many as there were Jumai! No one complained about making
wetlanders gai’shain anymore. They were so docile! A wide-eyed young man in rough-sewn white
hurried past clutching a basket, gaping at the people around him and stumbling over the hem of his
robe. Sevanna smiled. That one’s father had called himself the lord of this place and blustered that
she and her people would be hunted down—by children, of all things!—for this outrage, yet now he
wore white and worked as hard as his son, as did his wife and his daughters and his other sons. The
women had possessed many fine gems and beautiful silks, and Sevanna had only taken the first pick
for herself. A fat land, so soft it oozed rich oils.
The women behind her had stopped short to talk among themselves at the edge of the trees. She
caught what they were saying, and it turned her mood again.
“. . . how many Aes Sedai fight for these Seanchan,” Tion was saying. “We must learn that.”
Someryn and Modarra murmured agreement.
“I do not think it matters,” Rhiale put in. At least her contrariness extended to the others, too. “I
do not think they will fight unless we attack them. Remember, they did nothing until we moved against
them, not even to defend themselves.”
“And when they did,” Meira said sourly, “twenty-three of us died. And more than ten thousand
al-gai’d’siswai did not return either. Here, we have little more than a third of that number even
counting the Brotherless.” She soaked the last word in scorn.
“That was Rand al’Thor’s work!” Sevanna told them sharply. “Instead of thinking what he did
against us, think what we can do when he is ours!” When he is mine, she thought. The Aes Sedai had
been able to take and hold him as long as they had, and she had something the Aes Sedai had not, else
they would have used it. “Remember instead that we had the Aes Sedai beaten until he took their side.
Aes Sedai are nothing!”
Once again her effort to strengthen their hearts produced no visible effect. All they could
remember was that the spears had been broken trying to capture Rand al’Thor, and they with them.
Modarra might have been staring into the grave of all her sept, and even Tion frowned uneasily,
doubtless recalling that she, too, had run like a frightened goat.
“Wise Ones,” a man’s voice said behind Sevanna, “I have been sent to ask for your judgment.”
Instantly every woman’s face regained its equanimity. What she could not do, he had done with
his very presence. No Wise One would allow any but another Wise One to see her out of

countenance. Alarys stopped stroking her hair, which she had pulled over her shoulder. Plainly none
of them recognized him. Sevanna thought she did.
He regarded them gravely, with green eyes much older than his smooth face. He had full lips, but
there was a set to his mouth, as if he had forgotten how to smile. “I am Kinhuin, of the Mera’din,
Wise Ones. The Jumai say we may not take our full share from this place because we are not Jumai,
but it is because they will have less since we are two for every Jumai al-gai’d’siswai. The
Brotherless ask your judgment, Wise Ones.”
Now that they knew who he was, some could not hide their dislike of the men who had
abandoned clan and sept to come to the Shaido rather than follow Rand al’Thor, a wetlander and no
true Car’a’carn, as they thought. Tion’s face merely went flat, but Rhiale’s eyes flashed, and Meira
teetered on the edge of a scowl. Only Modarra showed concern, but then, she would have tried to
settle a dispute between treekillers.
“These six Wise Ones will give judgment after hearing both sides,” Sevanna told Kinhuin with a
graveness to match his.
The other women looked at her, barely concealing their surprise that she intended to stand aside.
It had been she who arranged for ten times the number of Mera’din to accompany the Jumai as went
with any other sept. She really had suspected Caddar, if not of what he had done, and she had wanted
as many spears around her as possible. Besides, they could always die in place of Jumai.
She affected surprise at the others’ surprise. “It would not be fair for me to take part since my
own sept is involved,” she told them before turning back to the green-eyed man. “They will give fair
judgment, Kinhuin. And I am certain they will speak in favor of the Mera’din.”
The other women gave her hard looks before Tion motioned abruptly for Kinhuin to lead the
way. He had to tear his eyes away from Sevanna to comply. Wearing a faint smile—he had been
staring at her, not Someryn—she watched them vanish into the mass of people moving about the
manor grounds. For all their misliking the Brotherless—and her making predictions to the man about
their decision—the chances were they would decide that way. Either Way, Kinhuin would remember
and tell the others of his so-called society. The Jumai were already in her belt pouch, but anything that
tied the Mera’din to her was welcome.
Turning, Sevanna strode back into the trees, though not toward the stable. Now that she was
alone, she could see to something much more important than the Brotherless. She checked what she
had tucked into her skirt at the small of her back, where her shawl hid it. She would have felt if it
slipped a hair, but she wanted to touch its smooth length with her fingers. No Wise One would dare
think her less than they, once she used that, perhaps today. And one day, it would give her Rand
al’Thor. After all, if Caddar had lied in one thing, maybe he had lied in others.
Through a blur of tears Galina Casban glared at the Wise One shielding her. As if there were any
need for the slender woman’s shield. Right then she could not have so much as embraced the Source.
Sitting cross-legged on the ground between two squatting Maidens, Belinde adjusted her shawl and
gave a thin smile, as if she knew Galina’s thoughts. Her face was narrow and foxlike, and her hair
and eyebrows had been bleached nearly white by the sun. Galina wished she had crushed her skull
instead of merely slapping her.
It had not been an attempt at escape, merely more frustration than she could bear. Her days began
and ended with exhaustion, every day more than the last. She could not remember how long since they
had stuffed her into that coarse black robe; the days ran together like an everlasting stream. A week?
A month? Maybe not that long. Surely not more. She wished she had never touched Belinde. If the
woman had not stuffed rags into her mouth to silence her sobbing, she would have begged to be

allowed to carry rocks again, or move a pile of pebbles stone by stone, or any of the tortures they
filled her hours with. Anything rather than this.
Only Galina’s head stuck out of the leather sack that hung suspended from the stout limb of an
oak. Directly beneath the sack, coals glowed in a bronze brazier, a slow burn, heating the air inside
the sack. She huddled in that sweltering heat with her thumbs tied to her toes, sweat slicking her
nakedness. Her hair clung damply to her face, and she panted, nostrils flaring for air, when she was
not sobbing. Even so, this would have been better than the endless, senseless, backbreaking labor they
subjected her to except for one thing. Before snugging the neck of the sack beneath her chin, Belinde
had emptied a pouch of some fine powder over her, and as she had begun to sweat, it had begun to
burn like pepper flung in the eyes. It seemed to coat her from the shoulders down, and, oh, Light, it
burned!
That she called on the Light measured her desperation, but they had not broken her for all their
trying. She would get free—she would!—and once she did, she would make these savages pay in
blood! Rivers of blood! Oceans! She would have them all skinned alive! She would . . . ! Flinging
back her head, she howled; the wadded rags in her mouth muffled the sound, but she howled, and she
did not know whether it was a shriek of rage or a scream for mercy.
When her howls died and her head fell forward, Belinde and the Maidens were on their feet, and
Sevanna was with them. Galina attempted to stifle her sobbing in front of the golden-haired woman,
but she could as soon have plucked the sun from the sky with her fingers.
“Listen to her whine and snivel,” Sevanna sneered, coming to look up at her. Galina tried to put
an equal contempt in her own stare. Sevanna decked herself with enough jewelry for ten women! She
wore her blouse unlaced to nearly bare her bosom, except for all those mismatched necklaces, and
breathed deep when men looked at her! Galina tried, but contempt was hard to manage with tears
rolling down her cheeks along with her sweat. She shook with weeping, making the sack sway.
“This da’tsang is tough as an old ewe,” Belinde cackled, “but I always found even the toughest
old ewe was made tender if cooked slowly, with the right herbs. When I was a Maiden, I softened
Stone Dogs with enough cooking.” Galina closed her eyes. Oceans of blood, to pay for . . . !
The sack lurched, and Galina’s eyes popped open as it began to settle. The Maidens had undone
the rope running over the limb, and the pair of them were lowering her slowly. Frantically she
thrashed about, trying to look down, and almost began sobbing anew, with relief, when she saw that
the brazier had been moved aside. With Belinde’s talk of cooking. . . . That would be Belinde’s fate,
Galina decided. Tied to a spit and turned over a fire until her juices dripped! That to begin!
With a thud that made Galina grunt, the leather bag hit the ground and toppled over. As
unconcerned as if they were handling a sack of potatoes, the Maidens tumbled her out onto the brown
weeds, sliced the cords that held her thumbs and toes, plucked the gag from between her teeth. Dirt
and dead leaves stuck to the sweat coating her.
She very much wanted to stand, to meet them all eye-to-eye and glare-for-glare. Instead, she rose
only as far as hands and knees, then dug her fingers into the mulch of the forest floor, dug her toes in.
Any farther, and she would not be able to stop her hands from flying to soothe her red, flaming skin.
Her sweat felt like the juice of ice peppers. All she could do was crouch there and quiver, try to work
some moisture back into her mouth and daydream of what she would do to these savages.
“I believed you were stronger than this,” Sevanna said above her in thoughtful tones, “but
perhaps Belinde is right. Perhaps you are soft enough, now. If you swear to obey me, you can stop
being da’tsang. Perhaps you will not even have to be gai’shain. Will you swear to obey me in all
things?”

“Yes!” The hoarse word flew from Galina’s tongue without hesitation, though she had to
swallow before speaking more. “I will obey you! I swear it!” And so she would obey. Until they gave
the opening she needed. Was this all that had been necessary? An oath she would have made the first
day? Sevanna would learn what it was like to hang over hot coals. Oh, yes, she. . . .
“Then you will not object to swearing your oath on this,” Sevanna said, tossing something down
in front of her.
Galina’s scalp crawled as she stared at it. A white rod like polished ivory, a foot long and no
thicker than her wrist. Then she saw the flowing marks carved into the end toward her, numerals used
in the Age of Legends. One hundred eleven. She had thought it was the Oath Rod, somehow stolen
from the White Tower. That also was marked, but with the numeral three, which some thought stood
for the Three Oaths. Maybe this was not what it seemed. Maybe. Yet no hooded viper from the
Drowned Lands coiled there could have frozen her so still.
“A fine oath, Sevanna. When did you intend to tell the rest of us?”
That voice jerked Galina’s head up. It could have pulled her eyes away from a hooded viper,
too.
Therava appeared among the trees leading a dozen cold-faced Wise Ones. When they stopped
behind her, confronting Sevanna, every woman present except for the Maidens had been there when
Galina was sentenced to wear the black robe. A word from Therava, a short nod from Sevanna, and
the Maidens departed swiftly. Sweat still oozed from Galina, but suddenly the air seemed cold.
Sevanna glanced at Belinde, who avoided her eye. Sevanna’s lip curled, half sneer, half snarl,
and she planted fists on hips. Galina did not understand where she found the nerve, a woman who
could not channel at all. Some of these women possessed not inconsiderable strength. No, she could
not afford to think of them only as wilders if she was to escape and have her revenge. Therava and
Someryn were stronger than any woman in the Tower, and any of them could have been Aes Sedai
easily.
But Sevanna faced them defiantly. “It seems you rendered justice quickly,” she said in a voice
dry as dust.
“The matter was simple,” Tion replied calmly. “The Mera’din received the justice they
deserved.”
“And they were told they received it in spite of your attempt to sway us,” Rhiale added with
some heat. Sevanna nearly did snarl at that.
Therava would not be diverted from her purpose, though. In one swift step she reached Galina,
gripped a handful of her hair and jerked her up to her knees, bent her head back. Therava was not the
tallest of these women by at least a head, yet she loomed taller than most men, staring down with a
hawk’s eyes, driving away every thought of revenge or defiance. The white streaks touching her dark
red hair only made her face more commanding. Galina’s hands clenched into fists on her thighs, nails
digging into her palms. Even the burning of her skin paled under that stare. She had daydreamed about
breaking every one of these women, making them plead for death, laughing as she denied their
begging. About every one except Therava. At night, Therava filled her dreams and all Galina could
do was try to flee; the only escape was to wake screaming. Galina had broken strong men and strong
women, but she stared up at Therava wide-eyed and whined.
“This one has no honor to shame.” Therava almost spat the words. “If you want her broken,
Sevanna, let me have her. When I am done, she will obey without the need for your friend Caddar’s
toy.”
Sevanna spoke up heatedly, denying friendship with this Caddar, whoever he was, and Rhiale

barked that Sevanna had brought him to the others, and others began arguing about whether the
“binder” would work any better than the “traveling box.”
A small part of Galina’s mind seized on mention of the traveling box. She had heard it spoken of
before, longed to lay hands on it if only for a moment. With a ter’angreal that enabled her to Travel,
however imperfectly it seemed to work, she would be able to. . . . Even hope of escape could not
stand against thoughts of what Therava would do to her if the others decided to give in to the
woman’s request. When the hawk-eyed Wise One loosed her hair to join the argument, Galina hurled
herself at the rod, landing flat on her belly. Anything, even having to obey Sevanna, was better than
being handed over to Therava. If she had not been shielded, she would have channeled to operate the
rod herself.
No sooner did her fingers close on the smooth rod than Therava’s foot came down on it hard,
trapping her hands painfully against the ground. None of the Wise Ones so much as glanced at her
where she lay writhing, trying futilely to pull free. She could not make herself pull too hard; dimly she
could recall making rulers pale with fear, but she did not dare disturb this woman’s foot.
“If she is to swear,” Therava said, staring hard at Sevanna, “it should be to obey all of us here.”
The others nodded, some voicing agreement, all but Belinde, and she pursed her lips thoughtfully.
Sevanna stared back just as hard. “Very well,” she acceded finally. “But me first among us. I am
not only a Wise One; I speak as the clan chief.”
Therava smiled thinly. “So you do. Two among us first, Sevanna. You and I.” Not a whisper of
defiance faded from Sevanna’s face, but she nodded. Grudgingly. Only then did Therava move her
foot. The light of saidar surrounded her, and a flow of Spirit touched the numerals at the end of the
rod in Galina’s hands. Just as was done with the Oath Rod.
For an instant, Galina hesitated, flexing mashed fingers. It felt the same as the Oath Rod, too; not
quite like ivory, not quite like glass, distinctly cool on her palms. If it was a second Oath Rod, it
could be used to remove any oath she swore now. If she were given the opportunity. She did not want
to take the chance, did not want to swear to Therava in any case. Always before this in her life, she
had commanded; life since her capture had been misery, but Therava would make her a lapdog! Yet if
she did not, would they let Therava break her? She could not find the smallest particle of doubt that
the woman would do just that. Utterly.
“Under the Light and by my hope of salvation and rebirth”—she no longer believed in the Light
or a hope of salvation, and there was no need to speak more than a simple promise, but they expected
a strong oath—“I swear to obey every Wise One present here in all things, and first among them,
Therava and Sevanna.” The last hope that this “binder” was something else vanished as Galina felt
the oath settle on her, as if she suddenly wore a garment that covered her far too tightly from her scalp
to the soles of her feet. Throwing back her head, she screamed. In part that was because it suddenly
seemed as if the burning of her skin was being pressed deep into her flesh, but mainly, it was pure
despair.
“Be quiet!” Therava said sharply. “I do not want to listen to you wailing!” Galina’s teeth clicked
shut, nearly biting her tongue, and she struggled to swallow her sobs. Nothing but obedience was
possible, now. Therava frowned at her. “Let us see if this truly works,” she muttered, bending closer.
“Have you planned violence against any Wise One here? Answer truthfully, and ask to be punished if
you have. The penalty for violence against a Wise One,” she added like an afterthought, “can be to be
killed like an animal.” She drew a finger expressively across her throat then gripped her belt knife
with the same hand.
Gulping air in horrified panic, Galina shied back from the woman. She could not take her eyes

away from Therava’s, though, and she could not stop the words that chattered through her teeth. “I ddid, ag-g-gainst all of you! P-please p-punish me f-for it!” Would they kill her, now? After all of this,
was she to die here?
“It seems this binder does as your friend claimed after all, Sevanna.” Plucking the rod from
Galina’s limp hands, Therava tucked it behind her belt as she straightened. “It also seems that you
will wear white after all, Galina Casban.” For some reason, she gave a pleased smile at that. But she
issued other commands, too. “You will behave meekly, as a gai’shain should. If a child tells you to
jump, you will jump unless one of us has said otherwise. And you will not touch saidar or channel
unless one of us tells you. Release the shield on her, Belinde.”
The shield vanished, and Galina knelt there, staring hollowly. The Source shone just out of sight,
tantalizing. And she could have sprouted wings as easily as she could stretch out for it.
Bracelets clattered as Sevanna shifted her shawl in anger. “You take too much on yourself,
Therava. That is mine; give it to me!” She held out her hand, but Therava merely folded her arms
beneath her breasts.
“There have been meetings among the Wise Ones,” the stern-eyed woman told Sevanna. “We
have reached certain decisions.” The women who had come with her gathered behind her, all of them
facing Sevanna, and Belinde hurried to join them.
“Without me?” Sevanna snapped. “Do any of you dare reach a decision without me?” Her tone
remained as strong as ever, but her eyes flickered to the rod in Therava’s belt, and Galina thought
there was a touch of uneasiness there. Another time, she would have been delighted to see it.
“One decision had to be reached without you,” Tion said in a flat voice.
“As you so often point out, you speak as the clan chief,” Emerys added, a mocking light in her
big gray eyes. “Sometimes, Wise Ones must talk without a clan chief listening. Or someone who
speaks as a chief.”
“We decided,” Therava said, “that just as a clan chief must have a Wise One to advise him, so
must you have a Wise One’s advice. I will advise you.”
Gathering her shawl around her, Sevanna studied the women confronting her. Her expression
was unreadable. How did she do it? They could crush her like an egg beneath a hammer. “And what
advice do you offer me, Therava?” she said at last in an icy voice.
“My strong advice is that we move without delay,” Therava replied, as cool as Sevanna. “These
Seanchan are too close and too many. We should move north into these Mountains of Mist and
establish a hold. From there, we can send parties to find the other septs. It may take long to reunite the
Shaido, Sevanna. Your wetlander friend may have scattered us to the nine corners of the world. Until
we do that, we are vulnerable.”
“We will move tomorrow.” If Galina had not been sure she knew Sevanna inside and out, she
would have thought the woman sounded petulant as well as angry. Those green eyes flashed. “But
east. That also is away from the Seanchan, and the lands to the east are in turmoil, ripe for plucking.”
There was a long silence, then Therava nodded. “East.” She said the word softly, the softness of
silk laid over steel. “But remember that clan chiefs have lived to regret rejecting a Wise One’s
advice too often. You may, as well.” The threat on her face was plain as that in her voice, yet
Sevanna laughed!
“You remember, Therava! All of you remember! If I am left for the vultures, so will you be! I
have made assurance of that.”
The other women exchanged worried glances, all but Therava, and Modarra and Norlea
frowned.

Slumped on her knees, whimpering and trying in vain to soothe her skin with her hands, Galina
found herself wondering what these threats meant. It was a small thought, worming its way through
bitterness and self-pity. Anything she could use against these women would be welcome. If she dared
use it. A bitter thought.
Abruptly she realized that the sky was turning dark. Billowing clouds were rolling down from
the north, streaked gray and black, obscuring the sun. And beneath the clouds fell flurries of snow,
swirling in the air. None reached the ground—few fell as far as the treetops—but Galina gaped.
Snow! Had the Great Lord loosened his grip on the world for some reason?
The Wise Ones stared at the sky, too, mouths hanging open as if they had never seen clouds,
much less snow.
“What is this, Galina Casban?” Therava demanded. “Speak if you know!” She did not look away
from the sky until Galina told her it was snow, and when she did it was to laugh. “I always thought the
men who ran down Laman Treekiller lied about snow. This could not hamper a mouse!”
Galina clamped her jaws shut on explaining about snowfalls, aghast that her instinct had been to
curry favor. Aghast as well at the small pang of pleasure that keeping the information back gave. I am
the Highest of the Red Ajah! she reminded herself. I sit on the Supreme Council of the Black Ajah!
They sounded like lies. This was not fair!
“If we are done here,” Sevanna said, “I will take the gai’shain back to the great roof and see her
put in white. You can remain and stare at the snow if you wish.” Her tone was so smooth, like butter
in the tub, that no one would have thought her at daggers’ points only moments earlier. She looped her
shawl over her elbows and adjusted some of her necklaces; nothing in the world concerned her more.
“We will take care of the gai’shain,” Therava told her just as smoothly. “Since you speak as the
chief, you have a long day and most of the night ahead of you if we are to move tomorrow.” For an
instant, Sevanna’s eyes flashed again, but Therava merely snapped her fingers and gestured sharply at
Galina before turning to go. “Come with me,” she said. “And stop pouting.”
Head down, Galina scrambled to her feet and scurried after Therava and the other women who
could channel. Pouting? She might have been scowling, but never pouting! Her thoughts scrabbled
like rats in a cage, finding no hope of escape. There had to be one! There had to be! One thought that
surfaced in the middle of that turmoil almost made her begin weeping again. Were gai’shain robes
softer than the scratchy black wool she had been forced to wear so far? There had to be a way out! A
hasty glance back through the trees showed Sevanna still standing there, glaring after them. Overhead,
the clouds swirled, and the falling snow melted like Galina’s hopes.

CHAPTER
12

New Alliances

G raendal wished there had been even a simple transcriber among the things she had removed
from Illian after Sammael’s death. This Age was frightful usually, primitive and uncomfortable.
Still, some of it suited her. In a large bamboo cage at the far end of the room a hundred brightly
plumaged birds sang melodiously, almost as beautiful in their multicolored flitting as her two
pets in transparent robes who waited on either side of the door, their gazes locked on her, eager
to serve her pleasure. If oil lamps did not give the same light as glowbulbs, aided by large
mirrors on the walls they produced a certain barbaric splendor with the gilded fish-scale
ceiling. It would have been nice to need only speak the words, but actually putting them on paper
with her own hand produced a pleasure akin to that she felt in sketching. The script of this Age
was quite simple, and learning to duplicate another’s style had been no more difficult.
Signing with a flourish—not her own name, of course—she sanded the thick page, then folded it
and sealed it with one of the signet rings of various sizes that made a decorative line across the
writing table. The Hand and Sword of Arad Doman impressed on an irregular circle of blue-andgreen wax.
“Take this to Lord Ituralde with all speed,” she said, “and say only what I told you.”
“As fast as horses can carry me, my Lady.” Nazran bowed as he took the letter, one finger
stroking thin black mustaches above a winning smile. Square and deeply brown in a well-fitting blue
coat, he was handsome; just not sufficiently handsome. “I received this from the Lady Tuva, who died
of her wounds after telling me that she was a courier from Alsalam and had been attacked by a Gray
Man.”
“Make sure there is human blood on it,” she admonished. She doubted anyone in this time could
tell human blood from any other, but she had found too many surprises to take an unnecessary chance.
“Enough for realism; not enough to spoil what I wrote.”
His black eyes lingered warmly on her as he bowed again, but as soon as he straightened he
hurried to the door, boots thudding on the pale yellow marble floor. He did not notice the servants
with their eyes fixed ardently on her, or affected not to notice, though he had once been a friend of the
young man. Only a touch of Compulsion had been needed to make Nazran nearly as avid to obey as

they, not to mention certain that he might yet taste her charms again. She laughed softly. Well, he
believed he had tasted them; just a little prettier, and he might have. Of course, he would have been
useless for anything else then. He would ride horses to death reaching Ituralde, and if that message,
delivered by Alsalam’s close cousin, supposedly coming from the King himself and with Gray Men
trying to stop it, did not satisfy the Great Lord’s command to increase chaos, nothing would, short of
balefire. And it would serve her own ends very nicely as well. Her own ends.
Graendal’s hand went to the only ring on the table that was not a signet, a plain golden band too
small for any but her little finger. It had been a pleasant surprise to find an angreal attuned to women
among Sammael’s possessions. A pleasant surprise to have time to find much of anything useful with
al’Thor and those puppies who called themselves Asha’man constantly in and out of Sammael’s
chambers in the Great Hall of the Council. They had stripped it bare of what she had not taken.
Dangerous puppies, all of them, especially al’Thor. And she had not wanted to risk anyone being
able to draw a line from Sammael to her. Yes, she must increase the pace of her own plans, and
distance herself from Sammael’s disaster.
Abruptly a vertical slash of silver appeared at the far end of the room, bright against the
tapestries hanging between the heavy gilded mirrors, and a crystalline chime rang loud. Her eyebrows
rose in surprise. Someone remembered the courtesies of a more civilized Age, it seemed. Standing,
she forced the plain band of gold down against the ruby ring on her smallest finger and embraced
saidar through it before channeling the web that would sound an answering chime for whoever
wanted to open a gateway. The angreal did not offer much, yet anyone who thought they knew her
strength would find a shock.
The gateway opened, and two women in nearly identical red-and-black silk dresses stepped
through warily. At least, Moghedien moved cautiously, dark eyes flickering in search of traps, hands
smoothing her wide skirts; the gateway winked out after a moment, but she held on to saidar. A
sensible precaution, though Moghedien had always been a great one for precautions. Graendal did not
let go of the Source, either. Moghedien’s companion, a short young woman with long silver hair and
vivid blue eyes, stared about her coldly, hardly more than glancing in Graendal’s direction. By her
demeanor, she might have been a Prime Counselor forced to endure the company of common laborers
and intent on ignoring their existence. A foolish girl, to imitate the Spider. Red and black did not suit
her coloring, and she should have made better use of such an impressive bosom.
“This is Cyndane, Graendal,” Moghedien said. “We are . . . working together.” She did not
smile when she named the haughty young woman, but Graendal did. A pretty name for a more than
pretty girl, but what twist of fate had led some mother of this time to give her daughter a name that
meant “Last Chance”? Cyndane’s face remained cold and smooth, but her eyes flared. A beautiful doll
carved from ice, with hidden fires. It seemed she knew the meaning and did not like it.
“What brings you and your friend, Moghedien?” Graendal asked. The Spider was the very last
she had expected to come out from the shadows. “Have no fear of speaking in front of my servants.”
She gestured, and the pair by the door sank to their knees, pressed their faces to the floor. They would
not quite fall dead by her simple command, but close.
“What interest can you find in them when you destroy anything that might make them interesting?”
Cyndane demanded, striding arrogantly across the floor. She held herself very straight, striving for
every hair of height. “Do you know that Sammael is dead?”
Graendal kept her own face smooth, with a little effort. She had supposed this girl some Friend
of the Dark whom Moghedien had picked up to run errands, perhaps a noble who thought her title
counted, but now that she was close. . . . The girl was stronger in the One Power than she herself!

Even in her own Age, that had been uncommon among men, and very rare indeed among women. On
the instant, on instinct, she changed her intention to deny any contact with Sammael.
“I suspected,” she replied, directing a false smile over the young woman’s head at Moghedien.
How much did she know? Where had the Spider found a girl so much stronger than she, and why was
she traveling with her? Moghedien had always been jealous of anyone with more strength. Or more of
anything. “He used to visit me, importuning my help in one mad plan or another. I never rejected him
outright; you know Sammael is—was a dangerous man to reject. He appeared every few days without
fail, and when he stopped, I assumed something dire had happened to him. Who is this girl,
Moghedien? A remarkable find.”
The young woman stepped closer, staring up at her with eyes like blue fire. “She told you my
name. That is all you need know.” The girl knew she spoke to one of the Chosen, and yet her tone
remained frost. Even given her strength, this was no simple Friend of the Dark. Unless she was
insane. “Have you paid attention to the weather, Graendal?”
Abruptly, Graendal realized that Moghedien was letting the girl do all the talking. Hanging back
until a weakness became apparent. And Graendal had been letting her! “I do not suppose you came to
tell me of Sammael’s death, Moghedien,” she said sharply. “Or to talk about weather. You know I
seldom go outside.” Nature was unruly, lacking order. There were not even windows in this room,
nor in most that she used. “What do you want?” The dark-haired woman was edging sideways along
the wall; the glow of the One Power still surrounded her. Graendal stepped casually so that both
remained in her sight.
“You make a mistake, Graendal.” A chilly smile barely curved Cyndane’s full lips; she was
enjoying this. “I lead between us. Moghedien is in a bad odor with Moridin for her recent mistakes.”
Wrapping her arms around herself, Moghedien shot the silver-haired little woman a scowl as
good as any spoken confirmation. Suddenly Cyndane’s big eyes opened even wider, and she gasped,
shuddering.
Moghedien’s glare turned malicious. “You lead for the moment,” she sneered. “Your place in his
eyes is not far better than mine.” And then she gave a start and shivered, biting her lip.
Was she being toyed with, Graendal wondered. The pure hatred for each other on the two
women’s faces seemed unfeigned. Either way, she would see how they enjoyed being played.
Unconsciously rubbing her hands together, rubbing the angreal on her finger, she moved to a chair
without taking her eyes from the pair. The sweetness of saidar flowing into her was a comfort. Not
that she needed comfort, but there was something odd here. The high straight back, thickly carved and
gilded, made the chair seem a throne, though it was no different from any other in the room. Such
things affected even the most sophisticated on levels they never knew consciously.
She sat leaning back with her legs crossed, one foot kicking idly, the picture of a woman at her
ease, and made her voice bored. “Since you lead, child, tell me, when this man who calls himself
Death is in his skin, who is he? What is he?”
“Moridin is Nae’blis.” The girl’s voice was calm and cold and arrogant. “The Great Lord has
decided it is time for you to serve the Nae’blis, too.”
Graendal jerked upright. “This is preposterous.” She could not keep the anger from her voice.
“A man I’ve never heard of has been named the Great Lord’s Regent on Earth?” She did not mind
when others tried to manipulate her—she always found a way to turn their schemes against them—but
Moghedien must take her for a half-wit! She had no doubt that Moghedien was directing this
obnoxious girl, whatever they claimed, whatever looks they stabbed at each other. “I serve the Great
Lord and myself, no other! I think the two of you should go, now, and play your little game elsewhere.

Demandred might be diverted by it. Or Semirhage? Be careful how you channel in leaving; I have set
a few inverted webs, and you would not want to trigger one.”
That was a lie, but a very believable one, so it came as a shock when Moghedien suddenly
channeled and every lamp in the room went out, plunging them into darkness. Instantly Graendal flung
herself from the chair so as not to be where they had last seen her, and she also channeled even as she
moved, weaving a web of light that hung to one side, a sphere of pure white that cast lurid shadows
about the room. And revealed the pair clearly. Without hesitation, she channeled again, drawing the
full strength of the little ring. She did not need it all, or even most, but she wanted every advantage
she could find. Attack her, would they! A net of Compulsion tightened on each of them before they
could twitch.
She had spun the nets strong, for anger’s sake, nearly strong enough to do harm, and the women
stood staring at her adoringly, eyes wide and mouths hanging open in adulation, intoxicated with
worship. They were hers to command, now. If she told them to cut their own throats, they would.
Suddenly Graendal realized that Moghedien was no longer embracing the Source. This much
Compulsion might have shocked her into letting go. The servants by the door had not moved, of
course.
“Now,” she said a touch breathlessly, “you will answer my questions.” She had a number,
including who was this Moridin fellow, if there was such a man, and where had Cyndane come from,
but one piqued her more than the rest. “What did you hope to gain by this, Moghedien? I may decide
to knot those webs on you. You can pay for your game by serving me.”
“No, please,” Moghedien groaned, wringing her hands. She actually began to weep! “You will
kill us all! Please, you must serve the Nae’blis! That is what we came for. To bring you to Moridin’s
service!” The silver-haired little woman’s face was a shadowed mask of terror in the pale light, her
bosom heaving as she gulped breath.
Suddenly uneasy, Graendal opened her mouth. This made less and less sense by the moment. She
opened her mouth, and the True Source vanished. The One Power vanished from her, and blackness
swallowed the room again. Abruptly the caged birds broke into a frenzy of chirruping; their wings
fluttered frantically against the bamboo bars.
Behind her, a voice rasped like rock being ground to dust. “The Great Lord thought you might not
take their word, Graendal. The time when you could go your own way has passed.” A ball of . . .
something . . . appeared in the air, a dead black globe, but a silver light filled the room. The mirrors
did not shine; they seemed to dull in that light. The birds went still, silent; somehow, Graendal knew
they had frozen in terror.
She gaped at the Myrddraal standing there, pale and eyeless and clothed in black deeper than the
ball, but larger than any she had ever seen. It had to be the reason she could not sense the Source, but
that was impossible! Except. . . . Where had that strange sphere of black light come from if not from
it? She had never felt the same fear others did at a Myrddraal’s gaze, not to the same degree, yet her
hands rose on their own, and she had to snatch them down to keep from covering her face. Glancing
toward Moghedien and Cyndane, she flinched. They had adopted the same pose as her servants,
crouching on their knees, heads to the floor toward the Myrddraal.
She had to work moisture into her mouth. “You are a messenger from the Great Lord?” Her
voice was steady, but weak. She had never heard of such a thing, the Great Lord sending a message
by Myrddraal, and yet. . . . Moghedien was a physical coward, but still one of the Chosen, and she
groveled as assiduously as the girl. And there was the light. Graendal found herself wishing her dress
were not cut so low. Ridiculous, of course; Myrddraal’s appetites for women were well known, but

she was one of the. . . . Her eyes drifted to Moghedien once more.
The Myrddraal strode by her sinuously, seeming not to pay her any heed. Its long black cloak
hung undisturbed by its movements. Aginor had thought the creatures were not quite in the world in
the same way everything else was; “slightly out of phase with time and reality,” he had called it,
whatever that meant.
“I am Shaidar Haran.” Stopping by her servants, the Myrddraal bent to grip them by the backs of
their necks, one hand to each. “When I speak, you may consider that you hear the voice of the Great
Lord of the Dark.” Those hands tightened to the surprisingly loud sound of cracking bone. The young
man spasmed as he died, kicking out; the young woman merely went limp. They had been two of her
prettiest. The Myrddraal straightened from the corpses. “I am his hand in this world, Graendal. When
you stand before me, you stand before him.”
Graendal considered carefully, if quickly. She was afraid, an emotion she was far more used to
inspiring in others, but she knew how to control her fear. While she had never commanded armies as
some of the others had, she was neither a stranger to hazard nor a coward, yet this was more than a
mere threat. Moghedien and Cyndane still knelt with their heads to the marble floor, Moghedien
actually trembling visibly. Graendal believed this Myrddraal. Or whatever it truly was. The Great
Lord was taking a more direct hand in events, as she had feared. And if he learned of her scheming
with Sammael. . . . If he chose to take action, that was; betting that he did not know was a foolish
wager at this point.
She knelt smoothly before the Myrddraal. “What would you have me do?” Her voice had
regained its strength. A necessary flexibility was not cowardice; those who did not bend for the Great
Lord were bent. Or snapped in two. “Should I call you Great Master, or would you prefer another
title? I would not feel comfortable addressing even the Great Lord’s hand as I would him.”
Shockingly, the Myrddraal laughed. It sounded like ice crumbling. Myrddraal never laughed.
“You are braver than most. And wiser. Shaidar Haran will do for you. So long as you remember who
I am. So long as you do not let bravery overcome your fear too far.”
As it issued its commands—a visit to this Moridin was first, it seemed; she would need to be on
her guard against Moghedien, and perhaps Cyndane also, taking revenge for her brief use of
Compulsion; she doubted the girl was any more forgiving than the Spider—she decided to keep to
herself the letter she had sent to Rodel Ituralde. Nothing she was told indicated that her actions would
be displeasing to the Great Lord, and she still had to consider her own position. Moridin, whoever he
was, might be Nae’blis today, but there was always tomorrow.

Bracing herself against the rocking of Arilyn’s coach, Cadsuane moved one of the leather
window curtains far enough to see out. A light rain fell on Cairhien from a gray sky full of
blustering clouds and rough, swirling winds. Not only the sky was full of wind. Howling gusts
rocked the coach more than did its forward motion. Tiny droplets stung her hand, cold as ice. If
the air cooled a little more, there would be snow. She drew her woolen cloak closer; she had
been pleased to find it, shoved to the bottom of her saddlebags. The air would cool.
The city’s steep slate roofs and stone-paved streets glistened wetly, and though the rain was not
hard, few were willing to brave the strong winds. A woman guiding an ox-cart with taps of a long
goad moved as patiently as her ox, but most people afoot clutched cloaks tightly, hoods pulled down,
and stepped quickly as the bearers of a sedan chair rushed by, its stiff con fluttering. Others beside
the woman and her ox saw no reason for haste, though. In the middle of the street a towering Aielman

stood gaping at the sky in disbelief while the drizzle soaked him, so absorbed that a daring cutpurse
sliced away his belt pouch and darted off unnoticed by his victim. A woman whose elaborately
curled, high-piled hair marked her as noble walked along slowly, her cloak flapping wildly, and its
long hood as well. This might have been the first time ever that she had actually walked in the streets,
but she was laughing as the rain slicked her cheeks. From the doorway of a perfumer’s shop, the
shopkeeper stared out disconsolately; she would do little business today. Most of the hawkers had
vanished for the same reason, but a handful still hopefully cried hot tea and meat pies from barrows
beneath makeshift awnings. Though anyone who bought a meat pie in the street these days deserved
the bellyache she would get.
A pair of starving dogs ran out from an alley, stiff-legged and hackles up, barking and snarling at
the coach. Cadsuane let the curtain fall. Dogs seemed to know women who could channel as easily as
cats did, but dogs appeared to think the women were cats, if unnaturally large ones. The pair of
women seated across from her were still in conversation.
“Forgive me,” Daigian was saying, “but the logic is inescapable.” She ducked her head
apologetically, making the moonstone dangling on a fine silver chain from her long black hair sway
across her forehead. Her fingers plucked the white slashes in her dark skirts, and she spoke rapidly,
as though afraid of being interrupted. “If you accept that the lingering heat was the Dark One’s work,
the change must be by some other agency. He would not have relented. You might say that he has
decided to freeze or drown the world instead of baking it, but why? Had the heat continued through
spring, the dead might well have outnumbered the living, no different than if snow falls into the
summer. Therefore, logically, some other hand is at work.” The plump woman’s diffidence was trying
at times, but as always, Cadsuane found her logic impeccable. She just wished she knew whose hand
and to what end.
“Peace!” Kumira muttered. “I would rather an ounce of hard proof than a hundredweight of your
White Ajah logic.” She was Brown, herself, though little given to their usual failings. A handsome
woman with shortcut hair, she was hardheaded and practical, a keen observer, and never lost herself
so deeply in thought that she lost sight of the world around her as well. No sooner had Kumira spoken
than she patted Daigian’s knee with a graceful hand, and gave a smile that changed her blue eyes from
sharp to warm. Shienarans were a polite people, by and large, and Kumira took care not to offend. By
accident, at least. “Put your mind to what we can do about the sisters held by the Aiel. I know you’ll
reason out something if anyone can.”
Cadsuane snorted. “They deserve whatever happens to them.” She had not been allowed near the
Aiel tents herself, nor had any of her companions, but some of the fools who had sworn fealty to the
al’Thor boy had ventured out to the sprawling encampment and come back white-faced and torn
between outrage and sicking up. Normally, she also would have been furious over the affront to Aes
Sedai dignity, whatever the circumstances; not now. To achieve her goal, she would have run the
entire White Tower through the streets naked. How could she concern herself with the discomfort of
women who might have ruined everything?
Kumira opened her mouth to protest despite knowing her feelings, but Cadsuane went on, calm
yet relentless. “Perhaps they’ll weep enough to atone for the dog’s dinner they made of matters, but I
doubt it. They are out of our hands, and if they were in mine, I might just give them to the Aiel. Forget
them, Daigian, and put that fine mind of yours on the track I set you.”
The Cairhienin woman’s pale cheeks flushed red at the compliment. Thank the Light she was not
this way except with other sisters. Kumira sat silently, very smooth-faced, her hands in her lap. She
might be subdued now, but little could subdue Kumira for long. They were exactly the pair Cadsuane

wanted with her today.
The coach tilted as the team started up the long ramp leading to the Sun Palace. “Remember what
I told you,” she told the other two firmly. “And have a care!”
They murmured that they would, as well they might, and she nodded. If need demanded, she
would use them both for mulch, and others too, but she did not intend to lose either because they grew
careless.
There was no bother or delay in letting the coach through the Palace gates. The guards
recognized Arilyn’s sigil on the doors, and they knew who would be riding inside. That coach had
been to the Palace often enough in the past week. The moment the horses halted, an anxious-eyed
footman in unadorned black opened the coach door, holding out a broad flat parasol of dark oiled
cloth. Rain dripped from the edge onto his bare head, but then, it was not intended for his shelter.
Quickly touching the ornaments dangling from the bun atop her head to be sure they were all
there—she had never lost one, but that was because she was careful of them—Cadsuane gathered the
handles of her square wicker sewing basket from beneath her seat and stepped down. Half a dozen
footmen stood waiting behind the first, parasols at the ready. So many passengers would have
crowded the coach beyond comfort, but the footmen were not about to be caught short, and the extra
did not hurry away until it was plain there were only the three of them.
Obviously the coach had been seen coming. Dark-garbed serving men and women made a neat
array on the deep blue and gold tiles of the great entry hall with its square-vaulted ceiling five spans
high. They leaped forward, taking cloaks, offering small, warm linen towels in case anyone needed to
dry face or hands, proffering Sea Folk porcelain goblets of mulled wine that gave off a heady scent of
spices. A winter drink, yet the sudden drop in temperature made it suitable. And after all, it was
winter. Finally.
Three Aes Sedai stood waiting to one side among the massive square columns of dark marble, in
front of tall, pale friezes depicting battles no doubt important to Cairhien, but Cadsuane ignored the
women for the time being. One of the young serving men had a small red-and-gold figure embroidered
on the left breast of his coat, what people were calling a Dragon. Corgaide, the grave-faced, grayhaired woman who ordered the servants in the Sun Palace, wore no ornament save for the large ring
of heavy keys at her waist. Nor did anyone else have any decoration on their clothes, and despite the
young man’s apparent enthusiasm, it was Corgaide, the Holder of the Keys, who would set the mood
among the servants. Still, she had allowed the young fellow his embroidery; a point to remember.
Cadsuane spoke to her quietly, asking after a room where she might work her embroidery hoop
undisturbed, and the woman did not blink at the request. But then, doubtless she had heard stranger,
serving in this place.
As the servants with the cloaks and trays bowed and curtsied themselves off, Cadsuane finally
turned to the three sisters among the columns. They were all looking at her, ignoring Kumira and
Daigian. Corgaide remained, but she stayed well back, giving the Aes Sedai privacy. “I hardly
expected to find you strolling about at your ease,” Cadsuane said. “I thought the Aiel worked their
apprentices hard.”
Faeldrin barely reacted, merely a slight jerk of her head that softly rattled the colored beads in
her thin braids, but Merana colored with embarrassment, and her hands clenched in her skirts. Events
had shaken Merana so deeply that Cadsuane was unsure she would ever recover. Bera, of course,
was very nearly unflappable.
“Most of us were given a freeday because of the rain,” Bera replied calmly. A sturdy woman in
plain wool—fine and well-cut, but decidedly plain—you might have thought her more at home on a

farm than in a palace. You might if you were a fool; Bera had a keen mind, a strong will, and
Cadsuane did not believe she ever made the same mistake twice. Like most sisters, she had not
entirely gotten over meeting Cadsuane Melaidhrin, alive and in the flesh, yet she did not let awe rule
her. After only the slightest of deep breaths, she went on. “I cannot understand why you keep coming
back, Cadsuane. Clearly, you want something from us, but unless you tell us what it is, we cannot help
you. We know what you did for the Lord Dragon”—she stumbled a little over the title; they still were
not quite sure what to call the boy—“but it’s obvious you came to Cairhien because of him, and until
you tell us why and what you intend, you must understand that you’ll find no aid from us.” Faeldrin,
another Green, gave a start at Bera’s bold tone, but she was nodding agreement before Bera finished.
“You must understand this, too,” Merana added, her serenity regained. “If we decide we must
oppose you, we will.” Bera’s face did not change, but Faeldrin’s mouth tightened briefly. Perhaps she
disagreed, and perhaps she did not want to reveal too much.
Cadsuane favored them with a thin smile. Tell them why and what? If they decided? So far they
had managed to stuff themselves into young al’Thor’s saddlebags tied hand and foot, even Bera.
Small recommendation for letting them decide so much as what to wear in the morning! “I did not
come to see you,” she said. “Though I suppose Kumira and Daigian would enjoy a visit, since you
have a freeday. You will excuse me.”
Motioning Corgaide to lead on, she followed the woman across the entry hall. She only glanced
back once. Bera and the others had already gathered up Kumira and Daigian and were hustling them
away, but hardly like welcome guests. More like herded geese. Cadsuane smiled. Most sisters
considered Daigian little better than a wilder and treated her little better than a servant. In that
company, Kumira hardly stood much higher. The most suspicious could not think they were there to
try to convince anyone of anything. So Daigian would pour the tea and sit quietly except when
addressed—and apply her excellent mind to everything she heard. Kumira would let everyone except
Daigian speak before her—and sort and file away every word, every gesture and grimace. Bera and
the rest would keep their oaths to the boy, of course—that went without saying—but how assiduously
was another question. Even Merana might be unwilling to go too far beyond bare obedience. That
was bad enough, yet it left considerable room for them to maneuver. Or be maneuvered.
Dark-liveried servants hurrying at their tasks along the broad, tapestry-hung hallways darted
aside for Cadsuane and Corgaide, and the two of them progressed to a flurry of deep bows and
curtsies made over baskets and trays and armloads of towels. From the way eyes watched Corgaide,
Cadsuane suspected the deference was as much for the Holder of the Keys as for an Aes Sedai. There
were a few Aiel about, too, huge men like cold-eyed lions and women like colder-eyed leopards.
Some of those gazes followed her icily enough to bring on the snow threatened by the rain outside, but
other Aiel nodded to her gravely, and here and there one of the fierce-eyed women went so far as to
smile. She had never claimed to be responsible for saving their Car’a’carn, but tales became twisted
in retelling, and the belief granted her more respect than any other sister, and certainly more freedom
of movement around the Palace. She wondered how they would feel if they knew that had she had the
boy in front of her right then, she would have been hard-pressed to stop herself from blistering his
hide for him! Barely more than a week since he nearly, got himself killed, and not only had he
managed to elude her completely, he had made her task even more difficult, if half what she heard
was true. A pity he had not been raised in Far Madding. But then, that might have led to its own
catastrophe.
The room Corgaide took her to was comfortably warm, with fires blazing in marble fireplaces at
either end of the chamber and lamps lit, mirrored flames in glass towers that chased the day’s gloom.

Plainly Corgaide had sent orders ahead to prepare while she was waiting in the entry hall. A serving
woman appeared almost as soon as they, with both hot tea and spiced wine on a tray, and small cakes
glazed with honey.
“Will there be anything else, Aes Sedai?” Corgaide asked as Cadsuane set her sewing basket
beside the tray on a table with edge and legs thickly gilded. Rigidly carved, too, as was the wide
cornice, also covered with gilt. Cadsuane always felt she was in a golden fish weir when she visited
Cairhien. Despite the light and warmth inside, rain dripping outside the tall narrow windows and the
gray sky outside heightened the sensation.
“The tea will do nicely,” she said. “If you will, tell Alanna Mosvani that I want to see her. Tell
her, without delay.”
Corgaide’s keys jingled as she curtsied, murmuring respectfully that she would find “Alanna Aes
Sedai” herself. Her grave expression never altered as she left. Very likely she was examining the
request for subtleties. Cadsuane preferred to be direct, when possible. She had tripped up any number
of clever people who had not believed she meant exactly what she said.
Opening the lid of her sewing basket, she took out her embroidery hoop with a less than halfdone piece of work wrapped around it. The basket had pockets woven inside to hold items that had
nothing to do with sewing. Her ivory hand mirror and hairbrush and comb, a pen case and tightly
stoppered ink bottle, a number of things that she had found useful to have at hand over the years,
including some that would have surprised anyone with nerve enough to search the basket. Not that she
often left it out of her sight. Setting the polished silver thread box carefully on the table, she selected
the skeins she needed and sat with her back to the door. The major image on her piece of embroidery
was finished, a man’s hand clutching the ancient symbol of the Aes Sedai. Cracks ran across the
black-and-white disc, and there was no telling whether the hand was trying to hold it together or crush
it. She knew what she intended, but time would tell what was truth.
Threading a needle, she set to work on one of the surrounding images, a bright red rose. Roses
and star-blaze and sunburst alternated with daisies and hearts-blush and snowcap, all separated by
bands of stark nettles and long-thorned briars. It would be a disturbing piece, when completed.
Before she had finished half a petal on the rose, a flash of motion reflected on the flat lid of the
thread box caught her eye. It had been carefully placed to reflect the doorway. She did not raise her
head from the hoop. Alanna stood there glaring at her back. Cadsuane continued the slow work of her
needle, but she watched that reflection from the corner of her eye. Twice Alanna half turned as if to
go, then finally drew herself up, visibly steeling herself.
“Come in, Alanna.” Still not raising her head, Cadsuane pointed to a spot in front of her. “Stand
there.” She smiled wryly as Alanna jumped. There were advantages to being a legend; people seldom
noticed the obvious when dealing with a legend.
Alanna stalked into the room in a swish of silk skirts and took the place Cadsuane had indicated,
but there was a sulky twist to her mouth. “Why do you persist in badgering me?” she demanded. “I
cannot tell you any more than I have. And if I could, I don’t know that I would! He belongs to—!” She
cut off abruptly, biting her lower lip, but she might as well have finished. The al’Thor boy belonged
to her; her Warder. She had the gall to think that!
“I have kept your crime to myself,” Cadsuane said quietly, “but only because I saw no reason to
complicate matters.” Lifting her eyes to the other woman, she kept her voice soft. “If you think that
means I won’t core you like a cabbage, think again.”
Alanna stiffened. The light of saidar suddenly shone around her.
“If you wish to be truly foolish.” Cadsuane smiled, a cold smile. She made no move to embrace

the Source herself. One of her dangling hair ornaments, intertwined golden crescents, was cool on her
temple. “You keep a whole hide at present, but my sufferance is not infinite. In fact, it dangles by a
thread.”
Alanna struggled with herself, unconsciously smoothing blue silk. Abruptly the glow of the
Power winked out, and she turned her head away from Cadsuane so swiftly that her long black hair
swung. “I don’t know any more to tell.” The sullen words rushed out of her breathily. “He was
injured, and then not, but I don’t think a sister Healed him. The wounds no one could Heal are still
there. He leaps about, Traveling, but he’s still in the south. Somewhere in Illian, I think, but at this
distance, he could be in Tear for all I know. He’s full of rage, and pain, and suspicion. There isn’t
any more, Cadsuane. There isn’t!”
Careful of the silver pitcher’s heat, Cadsuane poured a cup of tea, testing the thin green
porcelain cup for warmth. As might have been expected in silver, the tea had cooled quickly.
Channeling briefly, she heated it again. The dark tea tasted too much of mint; Cairhienin used mint
entirely too freely in her opinion. She did not offer a cup to Alanna. Traveling. How could the boy
have rediscovered what had been lost to the White Tower since the Breaking? “You will keep me
fully informed, however, won’t you, Alanna.” That was not a question. “Look at me, woman! If you
dream of him, I want every detail!”
Unshed tears glistened in Alanna’s eyes. “In my place, you would have done the same!”
Cadsuane scowled over the cup at her. She might have. There was no difference between what
Alanna had done and a man forcing himself on a woman, but, the Light help her, she might have, had
she believed it would help her reach her goal. Now, she no longer considered even making Alanna
pass the bond to her. Alanna had proved how useless that was in controlling him.
“Do not keep me waiting, Alanna,” she said in an icy tone. She had no sympathy for the other
woman. Alanna was another in a line of sisters, from Moiraine to Elaida, who had bungled and
worsened what they should have been mending. While she herself had been off chasing first Logain
Ablar and then Mazrim Taim. Which did not soothe her mood.
“I will keep you fully informed,” Alanna sighed, pouting like a girl. Cadsuane itched to slap her.
Alanna had worn the shawl over twenty years; she should have grown up more than this. Of course,
she was Arafellin. In Far Madding, few girls of twenty sulked and pouted as much as an Arafellin
could on her aged deathbed.
Abruptly, Alanna’s eyes widened in alarm, and Cadsuane saw another face reflected in the lid of
her thread box. Setting the cup back on the tray and her embroidery hoop on the table, Cadsuane stood
and turned to the door. She did not hurry, but she did not dally or play games as she had with Alanna,
either.
“Are you done with her, Aes Sedai?” Sorilea asked, stepping into the room. The leathery, whitehaired Wise One spoke to Cadsuane, but her eyes remained on Alanna. Ivory and gold clicked softly
at her wrists as she planted hands on her hips, and her dark shawl slid to her elbows.
When Cadsuane said that she was indeed done, Sorilea gestured curtly to Alanna, who stalked
from the room. Flounced might have been a better word, with sullen irritation on her face. Sorilea
frowned after her. Cadsuane had encountered the woman before, and interesting encounters they had
been, if brief. She had not met many people she considered formidable, but Sorilea was one. Perhaps
even a match for herself, in some ways. She also suspected the woman was as old as she was, maybe
older, and that, she had never expected to find.
No sooner had Alanna vanished than Kiruna appeared in the doorway, kicking gray silk skirts in
her hurry and peering down the hall in the direction Alanna had gone. And carrying an intricately

worked golden tray that held an even more elaborate golden pitcher with a high neck, and,
incongruously, two small, white-glazed pottery cups. “Why is Alanna running?” she said. “I would
have been faster, Sorilea, but—” She saw Cadsuane then, and her cheeks went the deepest possible
crimson. Embarrassment looked quite odd on the statuesque woman.
“Put the tray on the table, girl,” Sorilea said, “and go to Chaelin. She will be waiting to give you
your lessons.”
Stiffly, Kiruna set her burden down, avoiding Cadsuane’s eyes. As she turned to go, Sorilea
caught her chin in sinewy fingers. “You have begun to make a true effort, girl,” the Wise One told her
firmly. “If you continue, you will do very well. Very well. Now, go. Chaelin is not as patient as I.”
Sorilea waved toward the corridor, but Kiruna stood staring at her for a long moment, a strange
expression on her face. If Cadsuane had had to make a wager, she would have called Kiruna pleased
at the praise and surprised at being pleased. The white-haired woman opened her mouth, and Kiruna
gave herself a shake and hurried from the room. A remarkable show.
“Do you really think she will learn your ways of weaving saidar?” Cadsuane asked, hiding her
incredulity. Kiruna and the others had told her of these lessons, but many of the Wise Ones’ weaves
were very different from those taught in the White Tower. The first way you learned the weave for a
particular thing imprinted itself on you; learning a second was all but impossible, and even when you
could learn, the second-learned weave almost never worked nearly as well. That was one reason
some sisters did not welcome wilders to the Tower at any age; too much might have been learned
already, and could not be unlearned.
Sorilea shrugged. “Perhaps. Learning a second way is hard enough without all the hand-waving
you Aes Sedai do. The main thing Kiruna Nachiman must learn is that she owns her pride; it does not
own her. She will be a very strong woman once she learns that.” Pulling a chair around to face the
one Cadsuane had been sitting in, she eyed it doubtfully, then sat down. She appeared almost as stiff
and uncomfortable as Kiruna had, but she motioned authoritatively for Cadsuane to sit, a strongwilled woman used to command.
Cadsuane swallowed a rueful chuckle as she took her chair. It was well to be reminded that,
wilders or not, the Wise Ones were far from ignorant savages. Of course they would know the
difficulties. As for hand-waving. . . . Few had channeled where she could see, but she had noticed
that they created some weaves without the gestures that sisters used. The hand movements were not
truly part of the weave, but in a way they were, because they had been part of learning the weave.
Perhaps, once, there had been Aes Sedai who could, say, hurl a ball of fire without some sort of
throwing motion, but if so, they were long dead, and their teachings with them. Today, some things
just could not be done without the appropriate gestures. There were sisters who claimed they could
tell who had taught another sister by which motions she used for which weaves.
“Teaching any of our new apprentices anything has been difficult at best,” Sorilea went on. “I do
not speak to offend, but you Aes Sedai give oath, it seems, and immediately try to find a way around
it. Alanna Mosvani is particularly difficult.” Suddenly her clear green eyes were very sharp on
Cadsuane’s face. “How can we punish her willful failings if it means harming the Car’a’carn?”
Cadsuane folded her hands in her lap. Masking surprise was not easy. So much for the secret of
Alanna’s crime. But why had the woman let her know that she knew? Perhaps one revelation called
for another. “The bond does not work in that fashion,” she said. “If you kill her, he will die, then or
soon after. Short of that, he will be aware of what happens to her, but he will not really feel it. As far
away as he is now, he will only be vaguely aware, at that.”
Sorilea nodded slowly. Her fingers touched the golden tray on the table, then came away. Her

expression was as hard to read as the face of a statue, but Cadsuane suspected that Alanna would find
an unpleasant surprise the next time she let her temper flare, or threw one of her Arafellin sulks. That
was unimportant, though. Only the boy was important.
“Most men will take what is offered, if it seems attractive and pleasant,” Sorilea said. “Once,
we thought of Rand al’Thor so. Unfortunately, it is too late to change the path we walk. Now, he
suspects whatever is offered freely. Now, if I wanted him to accept something, I would pretend I did
not want him to have it. If I wanted to stay close to him, I would pretend indifference to whether I
ever saw him again.” Once more, those eyes focused on Cadsuane, green augers. Not trying to see
what lay inside her head. The woman knew. Some, at least. Enough, or too much.
Still, Cadsuane felt a rising thrill of possibility. If she had had any doubts that Sorilea wanted to
feel her out, they were gone. And you did not feel out someone in this manner unless you hoped for
some agreement. “Do you believe a man must be hard?” she asked. She was taking a chance. “Or
strong?” By her tone, she left no doubt she saw a difference.
Again Sorilea touched the tray; the smallest of smiles might have quirked her lips for an instant.
Or not. “Most men see the two as one and the same, Cadsuane Melaidhrin. Strong endures; hard
shatters.”
Cadsuane drew breath. A chance she would have scoured anyone else for taking. But she was
not anyone else, and sometimes chances had to be taken. “The boy confuses them,” she said. “He
needs to be strong, and makes himself harder. Too hard, already, and he will not stop until he is
stopped. He has forgotten how to laugh except in bitterness; there are no tears left in him. Unless he
finds laughter and tears again, the world faces disaster. He must learn that even the Dragon Reborn is
flesh. If he goes to Tarmon Gai’don as he is, even his victory may be as dark as his defeat.”
Sorilea listened intently, and kept silent even after Cadsuane finished. Those green eyes studied
her. “Your Dragon Reborn and your Last Battle are not in our prophecies,” Sorilea said at last. “We
have tried to make Rand al’Thor know his blood, but I fear he sees us as only another spear. If one
spear breaks in your hand, you do not pause to mourn before taking up another. Perhaps you and I aim
at targets not too far apart.”
“Perhaps we do,” Cadsuane said cautiously. Targets even a hand apart might be not at all alike.
Abruptly, the glow of saidar surrounded the leather-faced woman. She was weak enough to
make Daigian look at least moderately strong. But then, Sorilea’s strength did not lie in the Power.
“There is a thing you may find useful,” she said. “I cannot make it work, but I can weave the flows to
show you.” She did just that, laying feeble skeins that fell into place and melted, too poor to do what
they were intended for. “It is called Traveling,” Sorilea said.
This time, Cadsuane’s jaw dropped. Alanna and Kiruna and the rest denied teaching the Wise
Ones how to link, or a number of other skills they suddenly seemed to have, and Cadsuane had
assumed the Aiel had managed to wring them out of the sisters held in the tents. But this was. . . .
Impossible, she would have said, yet she did not believe Sorilea was lying. She could hardly
wait to try the weave herself. Not that it was of much use immediately. Even if she knew exactly
where the wretched boy was, she had to make him come to her. Sorilea was right about that. “A very
great gift,” she said slowly. “I have nothing I can give you to compare.”
This time, there was no doubt of the brief smile that flashed across Sorilea’s lips. She knew very
well that Cadsuane was in her debt. Taking up the heavy golden pitcher with both hands, she carefully
filled the small white cups. With plain water. She did not spill a drop.
“I offer you water oath,” she said solemnly, picking up one of the cups. “By this, we are bound
as one, to teach Rand al’Thor laughter and tears.” She sipped, and Cadsuane imitated her.

“We are bound as one.” And if their targets turned out not to be the same at all? She did not
underestimate Sorilea as ally or opponent, but Cadsuane knew which target had to be struck, at any
cost.

CHAPTER
13

Floating Like Snow

T he northern horizon was purple with the fierce rain that had hammered the east of Illian
through the night. Overhead, a morning sky of dark boiling clouds threatened, and strong winds
flung cloaks about, made banners snap and crack like whips on the crest of the ridge, the white
Dragon Banner and the crimson Banner of Light, and the bright standards of nobility from Illian
and Cairhien and Tear. The nobles kept to their own kind, three widely spaced knots awash in
gilt and silver-plated steel, silks and velvets and laces, but in common they looked around
uneasily. Even the best-trained of their horses tossed heads and stamped hooves on the muddy
ground. The wind was cold, and colder seeming for the heat it had replaced so abruptly, just as
the rain had been a shock after so long without. From whatever nation, they had prayed for the
baking drought to break, but none knew what to make of unrelenting storms in answer to their
prayers. Some glanced at Rand when they thought he would not notice. Perhaps wondering if he
had answered them so. The thought made him laugh softly, bitterly.
He patted his black gelding’s neck with a leather-gauntleted hand, glad that Tai’daishar did not
show nerves. The massive animal might have been a statue, awaiting the pressure of reins or knees to
move. It was good that the Dragon Reborn’s horse seemed as cold as he did, as though they floated in
the Void together. Even with the One Power raging through him, fire and ice and death, he was barely
aware of the wind, though it flailed his gold-embroidered cloak about and cut through his coat, green
silk thickly worked with gold and not intended for wear in such weather. The wounds in his side
ached and throbbed, the old and the new cutting across it, the wounds that would never heal, but that
was distant, too, another man’s flesh. The Crown of Swords might have been pricking someone else’s
temples with the sharp points of the tiny blades among its golden laurel leaves. Even the filth woven
through saidin seemed less obtrusive than it once had; still vile, still loathsome, but no longer worth
notice. The nobles’ eyes on his back were palpable, though.
Shifting his sword hilt, he leaned forward. He could see the tight cluster of low, wooded hills
half a mile to the east as clearly as if he were using a looking glass. The land was flat, here, the only
prominences those forested hills and this long ridge, thrusting up from the heath. The next thicket
dense enough to truly deserve the name lay close to ten miles off. Only storm-battered half-leafless
trees and tangles of undergrowth were visible on the hills, but he knew what they hid. Two, perhaps
three thousand of the men Sammael had gathered to try to stop him from taking Illian.
That army had disintegrated once they learned that the man who had summoned them was dead,

that Mattin Stepaneos had vanished, perhaps into the grave as well, and that there was a new king in
Illian. Many had scattered back to their homes, yet just as many clung together. Usually no more than
twenty here, thirty there, but a great army if they came together again, and countless armed bands
otherwise. Either way, they could not be allowed to roam the countryside. Time weighed down on his
shoulders like lead. There was never enough time, but maybe this once. . . . Fire and ice and death.
What would you do? he thought. Are you there? And then, doubtfully, hating the doubt, Were you
ever there? Silence answered, deep and dead in the emptiness that surrounded him. Or was there mad
laughter somewhere in the recesses of his mind? Did he imagine it, like the feel of someone looking
over his shoulder, someone just on the brink of touching his back? Or the colors that swirled just out
of sight, more than colors, and were gone? A thing of madmen. His gloved thumb slid along the
carvings that serpentined the Dragon Scepter. The long green-and-white tassels below the polished
spear-point fluttered in the wind. Fire and ice, and death would come.
“I will go talk to them myself,” he announced. Which produced a furor.
Lord Gregorin, the green sash of the Council of Nine slanted across his ornately gilded
breastplate, hurried his fine-ankled white gelding forward from the Illianers, followed closely by
Demetre Marcolin, First Captain of the Companions, on a solid bay. Marcolin was the only man
among them without silk or a speck of lace, the only man in plain if brightly burnished armor, though
the conical helmet resting on his saddle’s high pommel did bear three thin golden plumes. Lord Marac
lifted his reins, then let them fall uncertainly when he saw no others of the Nine move. A wide man
with a stolid manner, and new to the Council, he often seemed more craftsman than lord despite the
rich silks beneath his lavish armor and the falls of lace spilling over. High Lords Weiramon and
Tolmeran spurred together from the Tairens, as crusted with gold and silver as any of the Nine, and
Rosana, newly raised to High Lady and wearing a breastplate worked with the Hawk-and-Stars of her
House. There, too, others half made as if to follow then hung back, looking worried. Blade-slender
Aracome and blue-eyed Maraconn and bald-headed Gueyam were dead men; they did not know that,
but however much they wanted to be at the center of power, they feared Rand would kill them. Only
Lord Semaradrid came from the Cairhienin, on a gray that had seen better days, his armor battered, its
gilding chipped. His face was gaunt and hard, the front of his head shaved and powdered like a
common soldier, and his dark eyes shone with contempt for the taller Tairens.
There was plenty of contempt to go around. Tairens and Cairhienin hated one another. Illianers
and Tairens despised each other. Only Cairhienin and Illianers got along to any degree, and there was
a certain amount of prickle even there. Their two nations might not have near the long history of bad
blood shared by Tear and Illian, yet the Cairhienin still were foreigners, armed and armored on
Illian’s soil, welcomed halfheartedly at best and only that much because they followed Rand. But
despite all the frowning and bristling and trying to talk at once as they milled about Rand in a flurry of
windblown cloaks, they had a common goal now. After a fashion.
“Majesty,” Gregorin said hastily, bowing in his gold-tooled saddle, “I do beg you let me go in
your stead, or First Captain Marcolin.” The square-cut beard that left his upper lip bare framed a
round face creased with worry. “These men must know you are King—the proclamations do be read
in every village, at every crossroads, as we do speak—yet they may no show proper respect for your
crown.” Lantern-jawed Marcolin, clean-shaven, studied Rand with dark, deep-set eyes, giving no hint
what lay behind his impassive face. The Companions’ loyalty was to the crown of Illian, and
Marcolin was old enough to remember when Tarn al’Thor had been Second Captain over him, but
only he knew what he thought of Rand al’Thor as King.
“My Lord Dragon,” Weiramon intoned as he made his bow, not waiting for Gregorin to finish.

The man always intoned, and even on horseback he seemed to strut. His worked velvets and striped
silks and falls of lace almost overwhelmed his armor, and his pointed gray beard gave off a flowery
scent of perfumed oils. “This rabble is too petty to concern the Lord Dragon personally. Set dogs to
catch dogs, I say. Let the Illianers root them out. Burn my soul, they’ve done nothing so far to serve
you but talk.” Trust him to turn agreement with Gregorin into an insult. Tolmeran was lean enough to
make Weiramon appear bulky and somber enough to dim the luster of his garb; he was no fool, and
rival to Weiramon besides, yet he nodded slowly in agreement. No love lost there for Illianers, at all.
Semaradrid curled a lip at the Tairens but addressed himself to Rand, cutting in hard on
Weiramon’s heels. “This gathering is ten times as large as any other we have found so far, my Lord
Dragon.” He cared nothing for the King of Illian, and little enough for the Dragon Reborn, except that
the throne of Cairhien was Rand’s to give, and Semaradrid hoped it would be given to one he could
follow instead of fight. “Their loyalties must be to Brend, or so many would not have held together. I
fear talking to them is a waste of time, but if you must talk, let me ring their position openly with steel
so they know the price of putting a foot out of line.”
Rosana glared right back at Semaradrid, a lean woman, not tall yet nearly as tall as he, with eyes
like blue ice. She did not wait for him to finish, either, and she, too, spoke to Rand. “I’ve come too
far and invested too much in you to see you die now, for nothing,” she said bluntly. No more a fool
than Tolmeran, Rosana had claimed a place in the councils of the High Lords, though Tairen High
Ladies seldom did, and blunt was the word for her. Despite the armor most of the noblewomen wore,
none actually led their armsmen into battle, yet Rosana carried a flanged mace on her saddle, and
sometimes Rand thought she would like a chance to use it. “I doubt those Illianers lack for bows,” she
said, “and it takes only one arrow to kill even the Dragon Reborn.” Pursing his lips thoughtfully,
Marcolin nodded before catching himself, then exchanged startled looks with Rosana, each more
surprised than the other to find themselves of like mind with an ancient enemy.
“These peasants could never have found the mettle to stay under arms without encouragement,”
Weiramon continued smoothly, ignoring Rosana. He was skilled at ignoring who, and what, he did not
want to see or hear. He was a fool. “May I suggest my Lord Dragon look to these so-called Nine for
the source?”
“I do protest this Tairen pig’s insults, Majesty!” Gregorin growled right atop him, one hand
darting to his sword. “I do protest most heartily!”
“There are too many this time,” Semaradrid said at the same instant. “Most will turn against you
as soon as your back is to them in any case.” By his pointed frown, he might have been speaking of
the Tairens as well as the men on the wooded hills. Perhaps he was. “Better to kill them and be
done!”
“Did I ask for opinions?” Rand snapped harshly. Babble became silence, except for the crack of
cloaks and banners flapping in the wind. Suddenly expressionless faces regarded him, more than one
going gray. They did not know he held the Power, but they knew him. Not all of what they knew was
truth, but it was just as well they believed. “You will come with me, Gregorin,” he said in a more
normal voice. Still hard, though. Steel was all they understood; go soft, and they would turn on him.
“And you, Marcolin. The rest stay here. Dashiva! Hopwil!”
Everyone not named reined their horses back hurriedly as the two Asha’man rode to join Rand,
and the Illianers eyed the black-coated men as though they would have liked to remain behind, too.
Aside from anything else, Corlan Dashiva was glowering and muttering under his breath as he so
often did. Everyone was aware that saidin drove men mad sooner or later, and plain-faced Dashiva
certainly looked the part, lank untrimmed hair flying in the wind, licking his lips and shaking his head.

For that matter, Eben Hopwil, just sixteen and still with a few scattered blotches on his cheeks, wore
a staring frown that gazed beyond anything in sight. At least Rand knew the why of that.
As the Asha’man drew near, Rand could not help cocking his head to listen, though what he
listened for was inside his head. Alanna was there, of course; neither the Void nor the Power altered
that a whisker. Distance wore that awareness down to just that—awareness that she existed,
somewhere far to the north—yet there was something more today, something he had felt several times
recently, dim and barely on the edge of notice. A whisper of shock, perhaps, or outrage, a breath of
something sharp he could not quite grasp. She must feel whatever it was very strongly for him to be
even that conscious of it at this distance. Maybe she was missing him. A wry thought. He did not miss
her. Ignoring Alanna was easier than it had been once. She was there, but not the voice that used to
shout of death and killing whenever an Asha’man came into sight. Lews Therin was gone. Unless that
feel of someone staring at the back of his head, brushing his shoulder blades with a finger, was him.
Was there a madman’s hoarse laughter deep in his thoughts? Or was it his own? The man had been
there! He had!
He became aware of Marcolin staring at him, and Gregorin trying very hard not to. “Not yet,” he
told them wryly, and almost laughed when they clearly understood right away. Relief was too plain
on their faces for anything else. He was not insane. Yet. “Come,” he told them, and started
Tai’daishar down the slope at a trot. Despite the men following, he felt alone. Despite the Power, he
felt empty.
Between the ridge and the hills lay patches of thick scrub and long stretches of dead grass, a
glistening mat of brown and yellow beaten flat by the rain. Only a few days ago the ground had been
so parched that he had thought it could drink a river without changing. Then the torrents came, sent by
the Creator finding mercy at last, or maybe by the Dark One in a fit of black humor; he did not know
which. Now the horses’ hooves splashed mud at every second step. He hoped this did not take long.
He had some time, by what Hopwil had reported, but not forever. Perhaps weeks, if he was lucky. He
needed months. Light, he needed years he would never have!
His hearing heightened by the Power, he could make out some of what the men behind him were
saying. Gregorin and Marcolin rode knee-to-knee, trying to hold their cloaks against the wind and
speaking in low tones about the men ahead, about their fears the men might fight. Neither doubted they
would be crushed if they resisted, but they feared the effect on Rand, and his on Illian, if Illianers
fought him now that Brend was dead. They still could not bring themselves to give Brend his true
name, Sammael. The very notion that one of the Forsaken had ruled in Illian frightened them even
more than the fact that the Dragon Reborn ruled there now.
Dashiva, slumped in his gray’s saddle like a man who had never seen a horse before, muttered
angrily under his breath. In the Old Tongue, which he spoke and read as fluently as a scholar. Rand
knew a little, though not enough to understand what the fellow was mumbling. Probably complaints
about the weather; despite being a farmer, Dashiva disliked being out-of-doors unless the skies were
clear.
Only Hopwil rode in silence, frowning at something beyond the horizon, his hair and cloak
whipping about as wildly as Dashiva’s. Now and then he clutched the hilt of his sword
unconsciously. Rand had to speak three times, the last sharply, before Hopwil gave a surprised jerk
and booted his lanky dun up beside Tai’daishar.
Rand studied him. The young man—not a boy any longer, no matter his age—had filled out since
Rand first saw him, though his nose and ears still seemed made for a bigger man. A Dragon, redenameled gold, now balanced the silver Sword on his high collar, just like Dashiva’s. Once, he had

said he would laugh a year for joy when the Dragon was his, but he stared unblinking at Rand as
though looking through him.
“What you learned was good news,” Rand told him. Only an effort kept him from trying to crush
the Dragon Scepter in his fist. “You did well.” He had expected the Seanchan to return, but not so
soon. He had hoped not so soon. And not leaping out of nowhere, swallowing cities at a gulp. When
he found out that merchants in Illian had known for days before any of them thought to inform the Nine
—the Light forbid they should lose a chance at profit because too many knew too much!—he had been
within a hair of scouring the city to its foundations. But the news was good, or as good as it could be
in the circumstances. Hopwil had Traveled to Amador, to the countryside nearby, and the Seanchan
appeared to be waiting. Perhaps digesting what they had consumed. The Light send they choked on it!
He forced his grip to loosen on the length of Dragon-carved spearhead. “If Morr brings half as good, I
have time to settle Illian before dealing with them.” Ebou Dar, as well! The Light burn the Seanchan!
They were a distraction, one he did not need and could not afford to ignore.
Hopwil said nothing, only looked.
“Are you upset because you had to kill women?” Desora, of the Musara Reyn, and Lamelle, of
the Smoke Water Miagoma, and. . . . Rand forced down the instinctive litany even as it began
floating across the Void. New names had appeared on that list, names he did not remember adding.
Laigin Arnault, a Red sister who had died trying to take him a prisoner to Tar Valon. Surely she had
no right to a place, but she had claimed one. Colavaere Saighan, who had hanged herself rather than
accept justice. Others. Men had died in thousands, by his order or by his hand, but it was the faces of
the women that haunted his dreams. Each night, he made himself confront their silently accusing eyes.
Maybe it was their eyes he had felt of late.
“I told you about damane and sul’dam,” he said calmly, but inside of him, rage flared, fire
spiderwebbing around the emptiness of the Void. The Light burn me, I’ve killed more women than
all your nightmares could hold! My hands are black with the blood of women! “If you hadn’t wiped
out that Seanchan patrol, they’d have killed you for sure.” He did not say that Hopwil should have
avoided them, avoided the need to kill them. Too late for that. “I doubt that damane even knew how
to shield a man. You had no choice.” And better they were all dead than some escaping with word of
a man who could channel, scouting them.
Absently, Hopwil touched his left sleeve, where the black color disguised fire-scarred wool.
The Seanchan had not died easily or fast. “I piled the bodies in a hollow,” he said in a flat voice.
“The horses, everything. I burned it all to ash. White ash that floated in the wind like snow. It didn’t
bother me at all.”
Rand heard the lie on the man’s tongue, but Hopwil had to learn. After all, he had. They were
what they were, and that was all there was to it. All there was. Liah, of the Cosaida Chareen, a name
written in fire. Moiraine Damodred, another name that seared to the soul rather than merely burning.
A nameless Darkfriend, represented only by a face, who had died by his sword near. . . .
“Majesty,” Gregorin said loudly, pointing ahead. A lone man came out of the trees at the foot of
the nearest hill to stand waiting in an attitude of defiance. He carried a bow, and wore a pointed steel
cap and a belted mail shirt that hung nearly to his knees.
Rand spurred Tai’daishar to meet him seething with the Power. Saidin could protect him from
men.
Up close, the bowman did not make so brave a sight. Rust streaked his helmet and mail, and he
looked sodden, mud to his thighs, damp hair trailing down a narrow face. Coughing hollowly, he
scrubbed at a long nose with the back of his hand. His bowstring appeared taut, though; that, he had

protected from the rain. And the fletchings on the arrows in his quiver looked dry, too.
“Are you the leader here?” Rand demanded.
“You might say I do speak for him,” the narrow-faced man replied warily. “Why?” As the others
galloped up behind Rand, he shifted his feet, dark eyes like a cornered badger’s. Badgers were
dangerous, cornered.
“Watch your tongue, man!” Gregorin snapped. “You do speak to Rand al’Thor, the Dragon
Reborn, Lord of the Morning and King of Illian! Kneel to your King! What do your name be?”
“He do be the Dragon Reborn?” the fellow said doubtfully. Eyeing Rand from the crown on his
head to his boots, lingering a moment on the gilded Dragon buckling his sword belt, the man shook his
head as if he had expected someone older, or grander. “And Lord of the Morning, you do say? Our
King did never style himself so.” He made no move toward kneeling, or giving his name. Gregorin’s
face darkened at the man’s tone, and maybe at the man’s oblique denial of Rand as King. Marcolin
gave a slight nod, as though he had expected no more.
Damp rustlings stirred in the undergrowth among the trees. Rand heard easily, and abruptly he
felt saidin fill Hopwil. No longer staring at nothing, Hopwil studied the woodline intently, a wild
light in his eyes. Dashiva, silent, raking dark hair out of his face, looked bored. Leaning forward in
his saddle, Gregorin opened his mouth angrily. Fire and ice, but not yet death.
“Peace, Gregorin.” Rand did not raise his voice, but he wove flows to carry his words, Air and
Fire, so they boomed against the wall of trees. “My offer is generous.” The long-nosed man staggered
at the sound, and Gregorin’s horse shied. Those hidden men would hear clearly. “Lay down your
arms, and those who want to return home, can. Those who want to follow me instead, can do that. But
no man leaves here under arms unless he does follow me. I know most of you are good men, who
answered the call of your King and the Council of Nine to defend Illian, butI am your King, now, and
I’ll not have anyone tempted to turn bandit.” Marcolin nodded grimly.
“What about your Dragonsworn burning farms?” a man’s frightened voice shouted from the trees.
“They do be flaming bandits!”
“What about your Aiel?” another called. “I do hear they carry off whole villages!” More voices
from unseen men joined in, all shouting the same things, Dragon-sworn and Aiel, murderous brigands
and savages. Rand ground his teeth.
When the shouting faded, narrow-face said, “You do see?” He paused to cough, then hawked and
spat, maybe for his chest and maybe for emphasis. A pitiful sight, all wet and rust, but his backbone
was as tight as his bowstring. He ignored Rand’s glare as easily as he did Gregorin’s. “You do ask us
to go home unarmed, unable to defend ourselves or our families, while your people do burn and steal
and kill. They do say the storm be coming,” he added, and looked surprised that he had, surprised and
confused for a moment.
“The Aiel you’ve heard about are my enemies!” Not spiderwebs of flame this time, but solid
sheets of fury that wrapped tight around the Void. Rand’s voice was ice, though; it roared like the
crack of winter. The storm was coming? Light, he was the storm! “My Aiel are hunting them down.
My Aiel hunt the Shaido, and they and Davram Bashere and most of the Companions hunt bandits,
whatever they call themselves! I am the King of Illian, and I will allow no one to disrupt the peace of
Illian!”
“Even if what you say do be true,” narrow-face began.
“It is!” Rand snapped. “You have until midday to decide.” The man frowned uncertainly; unless
the roiling clouds cleared, he might have a difficult time knowing midday. Rand gave him no relief.
“Decide wisely!” he said. Whirling Tai’daishar about, he spurred the gelding to a gallop back toward

the ridge without waiting for the others.
Reluctantly he let go of the Power, forced himself not to hang on like a man clutching salvation
with his fingernails as life and filth drained from him together. For an instant, he saw double; the
world seemed to tilt dizzily. That was a recent problem, and he worried it might be part of the
sickness that killed men who channeled, but the dizziness never lasted more than moments. It was the
rest of letting go that he regretted. The world seemed to dull. No, it did dull, and became somehow
less. Colors were washed-out, the sky smaller, compared to what they had been before. He wanted
desperately to seize the Source again and wring the One Power out of it. Always it was so when the
Power left him.
No sooner had saidin gone, though, than rage bubbled in its place, white-hot and searing, nearly
as hot as the Power had been. The Seanchan were not enough, and brigands hiding behind his name?
Deadly distractions he could not afford. Was Sammael reaching out from the grave? Had he sown the
Shaido to sprout like thorns wherever Rand laid a hand? Why? The man could not have believed he
would die. And if half the tales Rand heard were true, there were more in Murandy and Altara and the
Light alone knew where! Many among the Shaido already taken prisoner had spoken of an Aes Sedai.
Could the White Tower be involved somehow? Would the White Tower never give him peace?
Never? Never.
Battling fury, he was blind to Gregorin and the rest catching up. When they topped the ridge
among the waiting nobles, he drew rein so abruptly that Tai’daishar reared, pawing the air and
flinging mud from his hooves. The nobles edged their mounts back, from his gelding, from him.
“I gave them to midday,” he announced. “Watch them. I don’t want this lot breaking into fifty
smaller bands and slipping away. I’ll be in my tent.” Except for wind-tossed cloaks they might have
been stone, rooted to one spot as if he meant the command to watch for them personally. At that
moment, he did not care if they stayed there till they froze or melted.
Without another word he trotted down the back slope of the ridge, followed by the two blackcoated Asha’man and his Illianer banner-bearers. Fire and ice, and death was coming. But he was
steel. He was steel.

CHAPTER

Message from the M’Hael

A

mile west of the ridge, the camps began, men and horses and cook fires, wind-flailed
banners and a few scattered tents clumped by nationality, by House, each camp a lake of churned
mud separated from the others by stretches of brushy heath. Men mounted and afoot watched
Rand’s streaming banners pass, and peered toward other camps to gauge reactions. When the
Aiel had been present, these men had made a single huge camp, driven together by one of the few
things they truly shared in common. They were not Aiel, and feared them however much they
denied it. The world would die unless he succeeded, but he had no illusions that they shared any
loyalty to him, or even believed that the fate of the world could not be made to accommodate
their own concerns, their own desires for gold or glory or power. A handful did, perhaps, a bare
handful, but for the most part, they followed because they feared him far more than they did the
Aiel. Maybe more than they did the Dark One, in whom some did not really believe, not in the
depths of their hearts, not that he could and would touch the world harder than he had already.
Rand stood before their faces, and they believed in that. He accepted it, now. He had too many
battles ahead of him to waste effort on one he could not win. So long as they followed and
obeyed, it had to be enough.
The largest of the camps was his own, and here Illianer Companions in green coats with yellow
cuffs rubbed shoulders with Tairen Defenders of the Stone in fat-sleeved coats striped black-andgold and an equal number of Cairhienin drawn from forty-odd Houses, in dark colors, some with con
stiff above their heads. They cooked at different fires, slept apart, picketed their horses apart, and
eyed one another warily, but they mingled. The safety of the Dragon Reborn was their responsibility,
and they took the job seriously. Any of them might betray him, but not while the others were there to
watch. Old hatreds and new dislikes would bring betrayal of any plot before the betrayer stopped to
think.
A ring of steel stood guard around Rand’s tent, a huge peaked thing of green silk embroidered all
over with bees in thread-of-gold. It had belonged to his predecessor, Mattin Stepaneos, and had come
with the crown, in a manner of speaking. Companions in burnished conical helmets stood side by side
with Defenders in helmets ridged and rimmed, and Cairhienin in bell-shaped helms, ignoring the
wind, barred faceguards hiding their features, halberds slanted precisely. Not one moved a hair when

Rand drew rein, but a bevy of servants came running to attend to him and the Asha’man. A bony
woman in the green-and-yellow vest of a groom from the Royal Palace in Illian took his bridle, while
his stirrup was held by a bulbous-nosed fellow in the black-and-gold livery of the Stone of Tear.
They tugged forelocks to him, and cast only one sharp look at one another. Boreane Carivin, a stout
pale little woman in a dark dress, self-importantly offered him a silver tray of damp cloths from
which steam rose. Cairhienin, she watched the other two, though more as if making sure they did their
tasks properly than with the animosity for each other they barely hid. But with care, still. What
worked with the soldiers worked with the servants as well.
Drawing off his gauntlets, Rand waved away Boreane’s tray. Damer Flinn had risen from an
ornately carved bench in front of the tent as Rand dismounted. Bald except for a ragged white fringe,
Flinn looked more a grandfather than an Asha’man. A leather-tough grandfather with a stiff leg, who
had seen more of the world than a farm. The sword at his hip looked as if it belonged, as well it
should on a former soldier of the Queen’s Guard. Rand trusted him more than most. Flinn had saved
his life, after all.
Flinn saluted, fist to chest, and when Rand acknowledged him with a nod, limped closer and
waited until the grooms left with the horses before speaking in a low voice. “Torval’s here. Sent by
the M’Hael, he says. He wanted to wait in the council tent. I told Narishma to watch him.” That had
been Rand’s command, though he was not sure why he had given it; no one who came from the Black
Tower was to be left alone. Hesitating, Flinn fingered the Dragon on his black collar. “He wasn’t
happy to hear you’d raised all of us.”
“Wasn’t he, now,” Rand said softly, tucking his gloves behind his sword belt. And because Flinn
still looked uncertain, he added, “You all earned it.” He had been about to send one of the Asha’man
to Taim—the Leader, the M’Hael, as the Asha’man all called him—but now Torval could carry the
message. In the council tent? “Have refreshments sent,” he told Flinn, then motioned Hopwil and
Dashiva to follow.
Flinn saluted again, but Rand was already striding away, black mud squelching around his boots.
No cheers rose for him in the blustering wind. He could recall when there had been. If that was not
one of Lews Therin’s memories. If Lews Therin had ever been real. A flash of color just beyond the
edge of sight, the feel of someone about to touch him from behind. With an effort, he focused himself.
The council tent was a large red-striped pavilion that had once sat on the Plains of Maredo, now
pitched in the middle of Rand’s encampment, surrounded by thirty paces of bare ground. There were
never guards here, not unless Rand was meeting with the nobles. Anyone trying to slip in would have
been seen instantly by a thousand prying eyes. Three banners on tall poles formed a triangle around
the tent, the Rising Sun of Cairhien, the Three Crescents of Tear, and the Golden Bees of Illian, and
above the crimson roof, higher than the rest, stood the Dragon Banner, and the Banner of Light. The
wind made them all stand out, rippling and snapping, and the tent walls shivered in the gusts. Inside,
colorful, fringed carpets made a floor, and the only furniture was a huge table, thickly carved and
gilded, inlaid with ivory and turquoise. A jumble of maps almost hid the tabletop.
Torval lifted his head from the maps, plainly ready to give the rough side of his tongue to
whoever had barged in on him. Close to his middle years and tall beside anyone save Rand or an
Aiel, he stared coldly down a sharp nose that practically quivered with indignation. The Dragon and
the Sword glistened on his coat collar in the light of the stand-lamps. A silk coat, shining black, cut
fine enough for a lord. His sword had silver mountings washed with gold, and a glittering red gem
capped the hilt. Another gleamed darkly on a finger ring. You could not train men to be weapons
without expecting a certain amount of arrogance, yet Rand did not like Torval. But then, he had no

need of Lews Therin’s voice to be suspicious of any man in a black coat. How far did he truly trust
even Flinn? Yet he had to lead them. The Asha’man were his making, his responsibility.
When Torval saw Rand, he straightened casually and saluted, but his expression barely changed.
He had had a sneering mouth the first time Rand ever saw him. “My Lord Dragon,” he said in the
accents of Tarabon, and he might have been greeting an equal. Or being gracious to an inferior. His
swaggering bow took in Hopwil and Dashiva as well. “I give congratulations on the conquest of
Illian. A great victory, yes? There would have been wine to greet you, but this young . . . Dedicated . .
. does not seem to understand orders.”
In the corner, silver bells on the ends of Narishma’s two long dark braids made a faint sound as
he shifted. He had tanned darkly in the southern sun, but some things about him had not changed. Older
than Rand, his face made him seem younger than Hopwil, but the red that rose in his cheeks was
anger, not embarrassment. His pride in the new-won Sword on his collar was quiet, yet deep. Torval
smiled at him, a slow smile both amused and dangerous. Dashiva laughed, a short bark, and was still.
“What are you doing here, Torval?” Rand asked roughly. He tossed the Dragon Scepter and his
gauntlets down atop the maps and followed them with his sword belt and scabbarded sword. The
maps that Torval had no reason to be studying. No need of Lews Therin’s voice.
With a shrug, Torval produced a letter from his coat pocket and handed it to Rand. “The
M’Hael, he sent this.” The paper was snowy white and thick, the seal a dragon impressed in a large
oval of blue wax that glittered with golden flecks. It might almost have been thought to come from the
Dragon Reborn. Taim did think well of himself. “The M’Hael said to tell you the tales of Aes Sedai
in Murandy with an army, they are true. Rumor says they are rebels against Tar Valon”—Torval’s
sneer thickened with disbelief—“but they are marching toward the Black Tower. Soon, they may
become a danger, yes?”
Rand cracked the magnificent seal to bits between his fingers. “They’re going to Caemlyn, not
the Black Tower, and they’re no threat. My orders were clear. Leave Aes Sedai alone unless they
come after you.”
“But how can you be sure they are not a threat?” Torval persisted. “Perhaps they are going to
Caemlyn, as you say, but if you are wrong, we’ll not know before they attack us.”
“Torval might be right,” Dashiva put in thoughtfully. “I can’t say I’d trust women who put me in
a box, and these haven’t sworn any oaths. Or have they?”
“I said leave them alone!” Rand slapped the tabletop, hard, and Hopwil jumped in surprise.
Dashiva frowned with irritation before hurriedly smoothing it over, but Rand was not interested in
Dashiva’s moods. By chance—he was sure it was chance—his hand had come down on the Dragon
Scepter. His arm trembled with the desire to take it up and stab Torval through the heart. No need for
Lews Therin at all. “The Asha’man are a weapon to be aimed where I say, not to flutter around like
hens every time Taim gets frightened over a handful of Aes Sedai having dinner at the same inn. If I
must, I can come back to make myself clearer.”
“I am sure there is no need of that,” Torval said quickly. At last something had wiped the wry
twist from his mouth. Eyes tight, he spread his hands, close to diffident, very nearly apologetic. And
plainly frightened. “The M’Hael, he merely wanted you informed. Your orders are read aloud every
day at Morning Directives, after the Creed.”
“That’s good, then.” Rand kept his voice cool, kept a scowl from his face by main effort. It was
his precious M’Hael the man feared, not the Dragon Reborn. Afraid Taim would take it amiss if
something he had said brought Rand’s anger on Taim’s head. “Because I’ll kill any one of you who
goes near those women in Murandy. You cut where I direct.”

Torval bowed rigidly, murmuring, “As you say, my Lord Dragon.” His teeth were bared in an
attempted smile, but his nose was pinched, and he struggled to avoid meeting anyone’s eyes while
seeming to avoid nothing. Dashiva yelped another laugh, and Hopwil wore a small grin.
Narishma was not enjoying Torval’s discomfort, though, or paying it attention. He looked at
Rand without blinking, as though he sensed deep currents that the rest missed. Most women and no
few men thought him just a pretty boy, but those too-big eyes sometimes seemed more knowing than
any others.
Rand pulled his hand from the Dragon Scepter and smoothed open the letter. His hands did not
quite shake. Torval smiled weakly, sourly, noticing nothing. Against the tent wall, Narishma shifted,
relaxing.
The refreshments arrived, then, borne by a stately procession following Boreane, a line of
Illianers and Cairhienin and Tairens in their various liveries. There was a servant bearing a silver
tray and pitcher for each kind of wine, and two more with trays of silver mugs for hot punch and
spiced wines and fine blown goblets for the others. A pink-faced fellow in green-and-yellow carried
a tray on which to do the pouring, and a dark woman in black-and-gold was there to actually handle
the pitchers. There were nuts and candied fruits, cheeses and olives, each sort requiring a serving
man or woman. Under Boreane’s direction, they flowed in a formal dance, bowing, curtsying, one
giving way to another as they made their offerings.
Accepting spiced wine, Rand hoisted himself onto the edge of the table and sat the steaming mug
beside him untouched as he busied himself with the letter. There was no address, no preamble of any
kind. Taim hated giving Rand any sort of title, though he tried to hide the fact.
I have the honor to report that twenty-nine Asha’man, ninety-seven Dedicated and three
hundred twenty-two Soldiers are now enrolled at the Black Tower. There have been a handful
of deserters, unfortunately, whose names have been stricken, but losses in training remain
acceptable.
I now have as many as fifty recruiting parties in the field at any given time, with the result
that three or four men are added to the rolls almost every day. In a few months, the Black
Tower will equal the White, as I said it would. In a year, Tar Valon will tremble at our
numbers.
I harvested that blackberry bush myself. A small bush, and thorny, but a surprising number
of berries for the size.
Mazrim Taim
M’Hael
Rand grimaced, putting the . . . the blackberry bush . . . out of his mind. What had to be done, had
to be done. The whole world paid a price for his existence. He would die for it, but the whole world
paid.
There were other things to grimace over, anyway. Three or four new men a day? Taim was
optimistic. In a few months, at that rate, there would be more men who could channel than Aes Sedai,
true, but the newest sister had years of training behind her. And part of that specifically taught how to
deal with a man who could channel. He did not want to contemplate any encounter between Asha’man
and Aes Sedai who knew what they were facing; blood and regret could be the only outcome,
whatever happened. The Asha’man were not aimed at the White Tower, though, no matter what Taim
thought. It was a convenient belief, however, if it made Tar Valon step warily. An Asha’man only
needed to know how to kill. If there were enough to do that at the right place and time, if they lived

long enough to, that was all they had been created for.
“How many deserters, Torval?” he said quietly. He picked up the wine mug and took a swallow,
as if the answer were unimportant. The wine should have been warming, but the ginger and sweet
serrel and mace tasted bitter on his tongue. “How many losses in training?”
Torval was recovering himself over the refreshments, rubbing his hands and arching an eyebrow
at the choice of wines, making a great show of knowing the best, making a show of lording it. Dashiva
had accepted the first offered, and stood glowering into his twist-stemmed goblet as though it held
swill. Pointing to one of the trays, Torval cocked his head thoughtfully, but he had the words ready on
his tongue. “Nineteen deserters, so far. The M’Hael, he has ordered them killed whenever they are
found, and their heads brought back for examples.” Plucking a bit of glazed pear from the proffered
tray, he popped it into his mouth and smiled brightly. “Three heads hang like fruit on the Traitor’s
Tree at this moment.”
“Good,” Rand said levelly. Men who ran now could not be trusted not to run later, when lives
depended on them standing. And these men could not be allowed to go their own way; those fellows
back on the hills, if they escaped in a body, were less dangerous than one man trained in the Black
Tower. The Traitor’s Tree? Taim was a great one for naming things. But men needed the trappings,
the symbols and the names, the black coats and the pins, to help hold them together. Until it was time
to die. “The next time I visit the Black Tower, I want to see every deserter’s head.”
A second piece of candied pear, halfway to Torval’s mouth, dropped from his fingers and
streaked the front of his fine coat. “It might interfere with recruiting, making that sort of effort,” he
said slowly. “The deserters, they do not announce themselves.”
Rand held the other man’s gaze until it fell. “How many losses in training?” he demanded. The
sharp-nosed Asha’man hesitated. “How many?”
Narishma leaned forward, staring intently at Torval. So did Hopwil. The servants continued
their smooth, silent dance, offering their trays to men who no longer saw them. Boreane took
advantage of Narishma’s preoccupation to make sure his silver mug held more hot water than spiced
wine.
Torval shrugged, too casually. “Fifty-one, all told. Thirteen burned out, and twenty-eight dead
where they stood. The rest. . . . The M’Hael, he adds something to their wine, and they do not wake.”
Abruptly his tone turned malicious. “It can come suddenly, at any time. One man began screaming that
spiders were crawling beneath his skin on his second day.” He smiled viciously at Narishma and
Hopwil, and nearly so at Rand, but it was to the other two he addressed himself, swinging his head
between them. “You see? Not to worry if you slide into madness. You’ll not hurt yourselves or a soul.
You go to sleep . . . forever. Kinder than gentling, even if we knew how. Kinder than leaving you
insane and cut off, yes?” Narishma stared back, taut as a harpstring, his mug forgotten in his hand.
Hopwil was once more frowning at something only he could see.
“Kinder,” Rand said in a flat voice, setting the mug back beside him on the table. Something in
the wine. My soul is black with blood, and damned. It was not a hard thought, not biting or edged; a
simple statement of fact. “A mercy any man might wish for, Torval.”
Torval’s cruel smile faded, and he stood breathing hard. The sums were easy; one man in ten
destroyed, one man in fifty mad, and more surely to come. Early days yet, and no way till the day you
died to know you had beaten the odds. Except that the odds would beat you, one way or another, in
the end. Whatever else, Torval stood under that threat, too.
Abruptly Rand became aware of Boreane. It took a moment before he recognized the expression
on her face, and when he did, he bit back cold words. How dare she feel pity! Did she think Tarmon

Gai’don could be won without blood? The Prophecies of the Dragon demanded blood like rain!
“Leave us,” he told her, and she quietly gathered the servants. But she still carried compassion
in her eyes as she herded them out.
Casting around for a way to change the mood, Rand found nothing. Pity weakened as surely as
fear, and they had to be strong. To face what they had to face, they all must be steel. His making, his
responsibility.
Lost in his own thoughts, Narishma peered into the steam rising from his wine, and Hopwil still
tried to stare through the side of the tent. Torval cast sideways glances at Rand and struggled to put
the scornful twist back on his mouth. Dashiva alone appeared unaffected, with his arms folded,
studying Torval as a man might study a horse offered for sale.
Into the painfully stretching silence burst a husky, windblown young man in black, with the
Sword and Dragon on his collar. Of an age with Hopwil, still not old enough to marry most places,
Fedwin Morr wore intensity more closely than his shirt; he moved on his toes, and his eyes had the
look of a hunting cat that knew itself hunted in turn. He had been different, once, and not so long ago.
“The Seanchan will move from Ebou Dar soon,” he said as he saluted. “They mean to come against
Illian next.” Hopwil gave a start and a gasp, jolted out of his dark study. Once again, Dashiva’s
response was to laugh, mirthlessly this time.
Nodding, Rand took up the Dragon Scepter. After all, he carried it for remembrance. The
Seanchan danced to their own tune, not the song he wished for.
If Rand received the announcement in silence, Torval did not. Finding his sneer, he raised a
contemptuous eyebrow. “Did they tell you all that, now?” he said mockingly. “Or have you learned to
read minds? Let me tell you something, boy. I have fought, against Amadicians and Domani both, and
no army takes a city then packs itself up to march a thousand miles! More than a thousand miles! Or
do you think they can Travel?”
Morr met Torval’s derision calmly. Or if it unsettled him at all, the only sign he gave was
running a thumb down his long sword hilt. “I did talk to some of them. Most were Taraboners, and
more landing by ship every day, or near enough.” Shouldering past Torval to the table, he favored the
Taraboner with a level look. “All stepping right quick whenever anybody with a slurring way of
speech opened a mouth.” The older man opened his, angrily, but the younger pressed on hurriedly, to
Rand. “They’re putting soldiers all along the Venir Mountains. Five hundred, sometimes a thousand
together. All the way to Arran Head already. And they’re buying or taking every wagon and cart
within twenty leagues of Ebou Dar, and the animals to draw them.”
“Carts!” Torval exclaimed. “Wagons! Is it that they mean to hold a market fair, do you think?
And what fool would march an army through mountains when there are perfectly good roads?” He
noticed Rand watching him, and cut off with a small frown, suddenly uncertain.
“I told you to stay low, Morr.” Rand let anger touch his voice. The young Asha’man had to step
back as he jumped down from the table. “Not to go asking the Seanchan their plans. To look and stay
low.”
“I was careful; I didn’t wear my pins.” Morr’s eyes did not change for Rand, still hunter and
hunted in one. He seemed to be boiling inside. Had Rand not known better, he would have thought
Morr held the Power, struggling to survive saidin even as it gave him life ten times over. His face
seemed to want to sweat. “If any of the men I talked to knew where they’re going next, they didn’t say,
and I didn’t ask, but they were willing to complain over a mug of ale about marching all the time and
never standing still. In Ebou Dar, they were soaking up all the ale in the city as fast as they could,
because they say they have to march again. And they’re gathering wagons, just like I said.” That all

came out in a rush, and he clamped his teeth at the end as though to trap more words that wanted to fly
from his tongue.
Smiling suddenly, Rand clapped him on the shoulder. “You did well. The wagons would have
been enough, but you did well. Wagons are important,” he added, turning to Torval. “If an army feeds
off the country, it eats what it finds. Or not, if it doesn’t.” Torval had not flickered an eyelid at
hearing of Seanchan in Ebou Dar. If that tale had reached the Black Tower, why had Taim not
mentioned it? Rand hoped his smile did not look a snarl. “It’s harder to arrange supply trains, but
when you have one you know there’s fodder for the animals and beans for the men. The Seanchan
organize everything.”
Sorting through the maps, he found the one he wanted and spread it out, weighted at one side
with his sword and at the other with the Dragon Scepter. The coast between Illian and Ebou Dar
stared up at him, rimmed for most of its length by hills and mountains, dotted with fishing villages and
small towns. The Seanchan did organize. Ebou Dar had been theirs barely more than a week, but the
merchants’ eyes-and-ears wrote of repairs well under way on the damage done to the city in its
taking, of clean sick-houses set up for the ill, of food and work arranged for the poor and those driven
from their homes by troubles inland. The streets and the surrounding countryside were patrolled so
that no one need fear footpads or bandits, day or night, and while merchants were welcome,
smuggling had been cut to a trickle if not less. Those honest Illianer merchants had been surprisingly
glum about the smuggling. What were the Seanchan organizing now?
The others gathered around the table as Rand perused the map. There were roads hard along the
coast, but poor straggling things, marked as little more than cart paths. The broad trade roads lay
inland, avoiding the worst of the terrain and the worst of what the Sea of Storms had to offer. “Men
raiding out of those mountains could make passage difficult for anyone trying to use the inland roads,”
he said finally. “By controlling the mountains, they make the roads safe as a city street. You’re right,
Morr. They are coming to Illian.”
Leaning on his fists, Torval glared at Morr, who had been right when he was wrong. A grievous
sin, perhaps, in Torval’s book. “Even so, it will be months before they can trouble you here,” he said
sullenly. “A hundred Asha’man, fifty, placed in Illian, could destroy any army in the world before one
man crosses the causeways.”
“I doubt an army with damane is destroyed as easily as one kills Aiel committed to an attack and
caught by surprise,” Rand said quietly, and Torval stiffened. “Besides, I have to defend all of Illian,
not just the city.”
Ignoring the man, Rand traced lines across the map with a finger. Between Arran Head and the
city of Illian lay a hundred leagues of open water, across the mouth of Kabal Deep, where, ship
captains in Illian said, their longest sounding lines could find no bottom just a mile or so from the
shore. The waves there could overturn ships as they surged north to pound the coast with breakers
fifteen paces high. In this weather, it would be worse. Marching around the Deep was a route of two
hundred leagues to reach the city, even keeping to the shortest ways, but if the Seanchan pressed on
from Arran Head, they could reach the border in two weeks despite the rainstorms. Maybe less.
Better to fight where he chose, not where they did. His finger slid along the south coast of Altara,
along the Venir range, until the mountains dwindled to hills short of Ebou Dar. Five hundred here, a
thousand there. A tantalizing string of beads dropped along the mountains. A sharp rap might roll them
back to Ebou Dar, might even pen them there while they tried to figure out what he was up to. Or. . . .
“There was something else,” Morr said abruptly, rushing again. “There was talk about some sort
of Aes Sedai weapon. I found where it was used, a few miles from the city. The ground was all

burned over, seared clean in the middle, a good three hundred paces wide or more, and ruined
orchards further. The sand was melted to sheets of glass. Saidin was worst, there.”
Torval waved a hand at him dismissively. “There could have been Aes Sedai near when the city
fell, yes? Or maybe the Seanchan themselves did it. One sister with an angreal could—”
Rand cut in. “What do you mean, saidin was worst there?” Dashiva moved, eyeing Morr oddly,
reaching as though to seize the young man. Rand fended him off roughly. “What do you mean, Morr?”
Morr stared, mouth shut tight, running his thumb up and down the length of his sword hilt. The
heat inside of him seemed ready to burst out. There really was sweat beading on his face now.
“Saidin was . . . strange,” he said hoarsely. His words came in rapid bursts. “Worst there—I could . .
. feel it . . . in the air all around me—but strange everywhere around Ebou Dar. And even a hundred
miles away. I had to fight it; not like always; different. Like it was alive. Sometimes. . . . Sometimes,
it didn’t do what I wanted. Sometimes, it . . . did something else. It did. I’m not mad! It did!” The
wind gusted, howling for a moment, shivering and snapping the tent walls, and Morr fell silent.
Narishma’s bells chimed at a jerk of his head, then were still.
“That isn’t possible,” Dashiva muttered into the silence, but nearly under his breath. “It is not
possible.”
“Who knows what’s possible?” Rand said. “I don’t! Do you?” Dashiva’s head came up in
surprise, but Rand turned to Morr, moderating his tone. “Don’t worry, man.” Not a mild tone—he
could not manage that—yet heartening, he hoped. His making, his responsibility. “You’ll be with me
to the Last Battle. I promise it.”
The young man nodded, and scrubbed at his face with his hand as though surprised to find it
damp, but he glanced at Torval, who had gone as still as stone. Did Morr know about the wine? It
was a mercy, given the alternatives. A small and bitter mercy.
Rand picked up Taim’s missive, folded the page, and thrust it into his coat pocket. One in fifty
mad already, and more to come. Was Morr next? Dashiva was surely close. Hopwil’s stares took on
a new meaning, and even Narishma’s habitual quiet. Madness did not always mean screaming about
spiders. He had asked once, warily, where he knew the answers would be true, how to cleanse the
taint from saidin. And got a riddle for answer. Herid Fel had claimed the riddle stated “sound
principles, in both high philosophy and natural philosophy,” but he had not seen any way to apply it to
the problem at hand. Had Fel been killed because he might have puzzled out the riddle? Rand had a
hint at the answer, or thought he might, a guess that could be disastrously wrong. Hints and riddles
were not answers, yet he had to do something. If the taint was not cleansed somehow, Tarmon
Gai’don might find a world already ruined by madmen. What had to be done, had to be done.
“That would be wondrous,” Torval said in a near whisper, “but how could anyone short of the
Creator or . . . ?” He trailed off uneasily.
Rand had not realized he had spoken any of his thoughts aloud. Narishma’s eyes, and Morr’s,
and Hopwil’s, belonged in one face, shining with sudden hope. Dashiva looked poleaxed. Rand
hoped he had not said too much. Some secrets had to be kept. Including what he would do next.
In short order, Hopwil was running for his horse to ride to the ridge with orders for the nobles,
Morr and Dashiva to find Flinn and the other Asha’man, and Torval was striding off to Travel back to
the Black Tower with commands for Taim. Narishma was last, and thinking of Aes Sedai and
Seanchan and weapons, Rand sent him away as well, with careful instructions that made the young
man’s mouth tighten.
“Speak to no one,” Rand finished softly, gripping Narishma’s arm hard. “And don’t fail me. Not
by a hair.”

“I won’t fail,” Narishma said, unblinking. With a quick salute, he was gone, too.
Dangerous, a voice whispered in Rand’s head. Oh, yes, very dangerous, maybe too dangerous.
But it might work; it might. In any event, you must kill Torval now. You must.
Weiramon entered the council tent, shouldering aside Gregorin and Tolmeran, trying to shoulder
aside Rosana and Semaradrid, the lot of them eager to tell Rand that the men in the trees had decided
wisely after all. They found him laughing till tears rolled down his face. Lews Therin had come back.
Or else he really was mad already. Either way, it was reason to laugh.

Stronger Than Written Law

I n the dim, cold dark of deep night, Egwene woke groggily from restless sleep and troubling
dreams, the more troubling because she could not remember them. Her dreams were always
open to her, as clear as printed words on a page, yet these had been murky and fearful. She had
had too many of those, lately. They left her wanting to run, to escape, never able to recall what
from, but always queasy and uncertain, even trembling. At least her head was not hurting. At
least she could recall the dreams she knew must be significant, though not how to interpret them.
Rand, wearing different masks, until suddenly one of those false faces was no longer a mask, but
him. Perrin and a Tinker, frenziedly hacking their way through brambles with axe and sword,
unaware of the cliff that lay just ahead. And the brambles screamed with human voices they did
not hear. Mat, weighing two Aes Sedai on a huge set of balance scales, and on his decision
depended. . . . She could not say what; something vast; the world, perhaps. There had been other
dreams, most tinged with suffering. Recently, all of her dreams about Mat were pale and full of
pain, like shadows cast by nightmares, almost as though Mat himself were not quite real. That
made her afraid for him, left behind in Ebou Dar, and gave her agonies of grief for sending him
there, not to mention poor old Thom Merrilin. But the unremembered dreams were worse, she
was sure.
The sound of low voices arguing had wakened her, and the full moon was still up outside,
casting enough light for her to make out two women confronting one another at the tent’s entrance.
“The poor woman’s head pains her all day, and she gets little rest at night,” Halima whispered
fiercely, fists on her hips. “Let this wait till morning.”
“I don’t propose to argue with you.” Siuan’s voice was winter itself, and she tossed back her
cloak with a mittened hand as though preparing to fight. She was dressed for the weather, in stout
wool no doubt worn over as many shifts as she could fit underneath. “You stand aside, and right
quick, or I’ll have your guts for bait! And put on some decent clothes!”
With a soft laugh, Halima drew up and if anything planted herself more squarely in Siuan’s way.
Her white nightgown clung, but was decent enough for its purpose. Though it did seem a wonder she
evaded freezing in that thin silk. The coals in the tripod braziers had died down long since, and

neither much-mended tent canvas nor layered carpets on the ground held in warmth any longer. Both
women’s breath was pale mist.
Throwing off the blankets, Egwene sat up wearily on her narrow cot. Halima was a country
woman with a skim of sophistication, and often she did not seem to realize the deference due to Aes
Sedai, or indeed seem to think she need defer to anyone. She spoke to Sitters as she might to the goodwives in her own village, with a laugh and a level eye and a straightforward earthiness that
sometimes shocked. Siuan spent her days giving way to women who had jumped at her word a year
earlier, smiling and curtsying for nearly every sister in the camp. Many still laid much of the Tower’s
troubles at her feet and thought she had hardly suffered enough to atone. Sufficient to keep anyone’s
pride at a stiff prickle. Together, the pair were a lantern tossed into the back of an Illuminator’s
wagon, but Egwene hoped to avoid an explosion. Besides, Siuan would not have come in the middle
of the night unless it was necessary.
“Go back to bed, Halima.” Smothering a yawn, Egwene bent to fumble her shoes and stockings
from beneath the cot. She did not channel a lamp alight. Better if no one noticed that the Amyrlin was
awake. “Go on; you need your rest.”
Halima protested, perhaps more strongly than she should have to the Amyrlin Seat, but soon
enough she was back on the tiny cot that had been squeezed into the tent for her. Very little room
remained to move in, with a washstand, a stand-mirror and a real armchair, plus four large chests
stacked atop one another. Those held the constant flow of clothes from Sitters who had not yet
realized that however young Egwene might be, she was not young enough to be dazzled or diverted by
silks and laces. Halima lay curled up, watching in the darkness, while Egwene hastily dragged an
ivory comb through her hair, donned stout mittens, and pulled a fox-lined cloak over her nightgown. A
thick woolen nightgown, and she would not have minded thicker in this weather. Halima’s eyes
seemed to pick up the faint moonlight and shine darkly, unblinking.
Egwene did not think the woman jealous of her place near the Amyrlin Seat, casual as it was,
and the Light knew she did not carry gossip, but Halima had an innocent curiosity about everything,
whether or not it was any of her business. Reason enough to hear Siuan out elsewhere. Everyone
knew now that Siuan had thrown in her lot with Egwene, after a fashion, as they thought, sullenly and
grudgingly. A figure of some amusement and occasional pity, Siuan Sanche, reduced to attaching
herself to the woman who held the title once hers, and that woman no more than a puppet once the
Hall finished fighting over who would pull her cords. Siuan was human enough to harbor sparks of
resentment, but so far they had managed to keep secret that her advice was far from grudging. So she
endured pity and snickers as best she could, and everyone believed her as changed by her experiences
as her face. That belief had to be maintained, or Romanda and Lelaine and very likely the rest of the
Hall, too, would find ways to separate her—and her advice—from Egwene.
The cold outside slapped Egwene in the face and flooded under her cloak; her nightgown might
as well have been Halima’s for all the protection it offered. Despite stout leather and good wool, her
feet felt as if they were bare. Tendrils of frosty air curled around her ears, mocking the thick fur lining
her hood. Yearning for her bed as she was, ignoring the iciness took all the concentration she could
muster. Clouds scudded across the sky, and moonshadows floated over the gleaming white that
covered the ground, a smooth sheet broken by the dark mounds of tents and the taller shapes of
canvas-topped wagons that now had long wooden runners in place of wheels. Many of the wagons
were no longer parked apart from the tents, but left where they had been unloaded; no one had the
heart to make the wagon drivers put out even that much extra effort at the end of the day. Nothing
moved except those pale sliding shadows. The wide runnels that had been trampled through the camp

for paths lay empty. The silence was crisp and so deep that she almost regretted breaking it.
“What is it?” she asked softly, casting a wary glance at the small tent nearby shared by her
maids, Chesa, Meri, and Selame. That was as still and dark as the others. Exhaustion made as thick a
blanket over the camp as the snow. “Not another revelation like the Kin, I hope.” She clicked her
tongue in vexation. She was spent, too, by long freezing days in the saddle and not enough real sleep,
or she would not have said that. “I’m sorry, Siuan.”
“No need to apologize, Mother.” Siuan kept her voice down as well, and glanced about to see
whether anyone might be watching from the shadows besides. Neither wanted to find herself
discussing the Kin with the Hall. “I know I should have told you beforehand, but it seemed a small
thing. I never expected those girls to even speak to one of them. There’s so much to tell you. I have to
try to pick and choose what’s important.”
With an effort, Egwene managed not to sigh. That was almost word for word the apology Siuan
had offered before. Several times. What she meant was that she was trying to force-feed Egwene over
twenty years of experience as Aes Sedai, more than ten of that as Amyrlin, and do it in months. At
times Egwene felt like a goose being fattened for market. “Well, what’s important tonight?”
“Gareth Bryne’s waiting in your study.” Siuan did not raise her voice, but it took on an edge, as
always when she spoke of Lord Bryne. She tossed her head angrily inside the deep hood of her cloak,
and made a sound like a cat spitting. “The man came in dripping snow, scooped me out of my
bedding, and barely gave me time to dress before hauling me up behind his saddle. He told me
nothing; just tossed me down at the edge of camp and sent me to fetch you like I was a serving girl!”
Firmly, Egwene stifled a rising hope. There had been too many disappointments, and whatever
had brought Bryne in the middle of the night was much more likely to be a potential disaster than what
she wished for. How far yet to the border with Andor? “Let’s see what he wants.”
Starting off toward the tent everyone named the Amyrlin’s Study, she held her cloak close. She
did not shiver, but refusing to let heat or cold touch you did not make them go away. You could ignore
them right up to the moment sunstroke cooked your brain or frostbite rotted your hands and feet. She
considered what Siuan had said.
“You weren’t sleeping in your own tent here?” she said carefully. The other woman’s relation to
Lord Bryne was that of a servant, in a very peculiar way, but Egwene hoped Siuan was not letting her
stubborn pride lead her into letting him take advantage. She could not imagine it, of him or her, yet not
so long ago she could not have imagined Siuan accepting any part of the situation. She still could not
understand why.
Snorting loudly, Siuan kicked her skirts, and nearly fell as her shoes skidded. Snow beaten down
by countless feet had quickly become a rough sheet of ice. Egwene was picking her own way
cautiously. Every day brought broken bones that travel-weary sisters had to Heal. Half abandoning
her cloak, she offered an arm as much for the support she might receive as give. Siuan took it,
muttering.
“By the time I finished cleaning the man’s spare boots and second saddle, it was too late to
tramp back through this. Not that he offered more than blankets in a corner; not Gareth Bryne! Made
me dig them out of the chest myself, while he went off the Light knows where! Men are a trial, and
that one the worst!” Without a pause for breath, she changed the subject. “You shouldn’t let that
Halima sleep in your tent. She’s another pair of ears you have to be careful of, and snoopy with it.
Besides, you’re lucky you don’t walk in to find her entertaining some soldier.”
“I am very glad that Delana can spare Halima nights,” Egwene said firmly. “I need her. Unless
you think Nisao’s Healing might do better with my headaches a second time around.” Halima’s

fingers seemed to draw the pain out through her scalp; without that, she would not be able to sleep at
all. Nisao’s effort had had no effect whatsoever, and she was the only Yellow Egwene dared
approach with the problem. As for the rest. . . . She made her voice sterner still. “I am surprised
you’re still listening to that gossip, daughter. The fact that men like looking at a woman doesn’t mean
she invites it, as you should know well. I’ve seen more than a few looking at you and grinning.”
Taking that tone came easier than it once had.
Siuan gave her a startled sidelong glance and, after a moment, grumbled an apology. It might
have been sincere. Egwene accepted it, either way. Lord Bryne was very bad for Siuan’s temper, and
tossing Halima into the bargain, Egwene thought it a good job she was not pushed into taking a stricter
stance. Siuan herself had said that she should not put up with nonsense, and she surely could not
afford to put up with it from Siuan, of all people.
Trudging arm-in-arm, they went on in silence, the cold fogging their breath and seeping through
their flesh. The snow was a curse and a lesson. She could still hear Siuan going on about what she
called the Law of Unintended Consequences, stronger than any written law. Whether or not what you
do has the effect you want, it will have three at least you never expected, and one of those usually
unpleasant.
The first, feeble rains had brought astonishment, for all Egwene had already informed the Hall
that the Bowl of the Winds had been found and used. That was almost as much as she could risk
letting them know of what Elayne had told her in Tel’aran’ rhiod; too much of what had happened in
Ebou Dar was just the thing to cut her feet out from under her here, and her position was precarious
enough as it was. An explosion of joy erupted at those first sprinkles. They had halted the march at
midday, and there had been bonfires and feasting in the drizzle, prayers of thanksgiving among the
sisters and dancing among the servants and the soldiers. For that matter, some of the Aes Sedai had
danced, too.
A few days later, the soft rains became downpours, and then howling tempests. The temperature
slid downward, plummeted, and tempests became blizzards. Now, the distance once covered in a
day, with Egwene gritting her teeth over how slowly they moved, took five when the sky held only
clouds, and when the snows fell, they did not move at all. Easy enough to think of three unintended
consequences, or more, and the snow might well be the least unpleasant.
As they approached the small, patched tent called the Amyrlin’s Study, a shadow moved beside
one of the tall wagons, and Egwene’s breath caught. The shadow became a figure who slipped back
her hood enough to reveal Leane’s face, then pulled back into darkness.
“She’ll keep a watch and let us know if anybody comes,” Siuan said softly.
“That’s good,” Egwene muttered. The woman could have told her in advance. She had half been
afraid it was Romanda or Lelaine!
The Amyrlin’s Study was dark, but Lord Bryne stood waiting patiently inside, wrapped in his
cloak, a shadow among shadows. Embracing the Source, Egwene channeled, not to light the lantern
hanging from the center-pole or one of the candles, but to make a small sphere of pale light that she
suspended in the air over the folding table she used as a writing desk. Very small, and very pale;
unlikely to be noticed from outside, and quick as thought to extinguish. She could not afford
discovery.
There had been Amyrlins who reigned in strength, Amyrlins who managed an even balance with
the Hall, and Amyrlins who had had as little power as she, or less upon rare occasions, well-hidden
in the secret histories of the White Tower. Several had frittered away power and influence, falling
from strength to weakness, but in over three thousand years, precious few had managed to move in the

other direction. Egwene very much wished she knew how Myriam Copan and the rest of that bare
handful had managed. If anyone had ever thought to write that down, the pages were long lost.
Bowing respectfully, Bryne showed no surprise at her caution. He knew what she put at hazard,
meeting him secretly. To a very large degree, she trusted this sturdy, heavily graying man with the
bluff, weathered face, and not only because she had to. His cloak was thick red wool, lined with
marten and bordered with the Flame of Tar Valon, a gift from the Hall, yet he had made plain a dozen
times in the past weeks that whatever the Hall thought—and he was not blind enough to have missed
that!—she was the Amyrlin, and he followed the Amyrlin. Oh, he had never said so right out, but with
carefully worded hints that left no doubts. Expecting more would have been expecting too much.
There were nearly as many undercurrents in the camp as there were Aes Sedai, some strong enough to
pull him down. Several strong enough to mire her deeper than she was, if the Hall learned of this
meeting. She trusted him further than anyone except Siuan and Leane, or Elayne and Nynaeve, maybe
further than any of the sisters who had sworn fealty to her in secret, and she wished she had the
courage to trust him more. The ball of white light cast weak, fitful shadows.
“You have news, Lord Bryne?” she asked, stifling hope. She could think of a dozen possible
messages that might bring him in the night, each with its own set of pitfalls and snares. Had Rand
decided to add more crowns to that of Illian, or the Seanchan somehow captured still another city, or
the Band of the Red Hand suddenly moved on its own instead of shadowing the Aes Sedai, or. . . .
“An army lies north of us, Mother,” he replied calmly. His leather-gauntleted hands rested
lightly atop his long sword hilt. An army to the north, a little more snow, all the same. “Andorans,
mainly, but with a goodly number of Murandians. My deep scouts brought the news less than an hour
ago. Pelivar leads, and Arathelle is with him, the High Seats of two of the strongest Houses in Andor,
and they’ve brought twenty more at least. They’re pushing south hard, it seems. If you keep on as you
are, which I advise against, we should meet head-on in two days, three at the outside.”
Egwene kept her face smooth, suppressing her relief. What she had been hoping for, waiting for;
what she had begun to fear might never come. Surprisingly, it was Siuan who gasped, and clapped a
mittened hand over her mouth too late. Bryne cocked an eyebrow at her, but she recovered quickly,
putting on Aes Sedai serenity so thick you almost forgot her youthful face.
“Do you have qualms at fighting your fellow Andorans?” she demanded. “Speak up, man. I’m not
your washwoman here.” Well, there was a small crack in that serenity.
“As you command, Siuan Sedai.” Bryne’s tone held no scrap of mockery, yet Siuan’s mouth
began to tighten, her outward coolness evaporating fast. He made her a small bow, workmanlike but
acceptable. “I will fight whoever the Mother wishes me to fight, of course.” Even here, he would not
be more forthcoming. Men learned caution around Aes Sedai. So did women. Egwene thought caution
had become a second skin for her.
“And if we don’t keep on?” she said. So much planning, just her and Siuan and sometimes
Leane, and now she still had to feel out each step as carefully as on those icy paths outside. “If we
stop here?”
He did not hesitate. “If you have a way to bring them around without fighting, all well and good,
but some time tomorrow they’ll reach an excellent position to defend, one flank held by the River
Armahn, the other by a large peat bog, and small streams in front to break up attacks. Pelivar will
settle in there to wait; he knows the work. Arathelle will have her part if there’s talking, but she’ll
leave the pikes and swords to him. We can’t reach it ahead of him, and anyway, the terrain is no use
to us there, with him to the north. If you mean to fight, I advise making for that ridge we crossed two
days back. We can reach it in good order ahead of them if we start at dawn, and Pelivar would think

twice about coming at us there if he had three times the numbers he does.”
Wriggling near-frozen toes inside her stockings, Egwene let out an annoyed sigh. There was a
difference between not letting cold touch you and not feeling it. Picking her way carefully, not letting
herself be distracted by the chill, she asked, “Will they talk, offered the chance?”
“Probably, Mother. The Murandians hardly count; they’re just there for whatever advantage they
can wring out of the situation, same as their countrymen under me. It’s Pelivar and Arathelle who
matter. If I had to wager, I’d say they only mean to keep you out of Andor.” He shook his head grimly.
“But they’ll fight if they have to, if they must, maybe even if it means facing Aes Sedai instead of just
soldiers. I expect they’ve heard the same tales we have about that battle out east somewhere.”
“Fish guts!” Siuan growled. So much for calm. “Half-baked rumors and raw gossip are no proof
there was any battle, you lummox, and if there was, sisters wouldn’t have gotten themselves mixed up
in it!” The man truly was an occasion of sin for her.
Strangely, Bryne smiled. He often did when Siuan showed her temper. Anywhere else, on
anyone else, Egwene would have called the smile fond. “Better for us if they believe,” he told Siuan
mildly. Her face darkened so, you might have thought he had sneered at her.
Why did a normally sensible woman let Bryne get under her skin? Whatever the reason, Egwene
had no time for it tonight. “Siuan, I see someone forgot to take away the mulled wine. It can’t have
soured in this weather. Warm it for us, please.” She did not like setting the other woman down in
front of Bryne, but she had to be reined in, and this seemed the gentlest way to do it. Really, they
should not have left the silver pitcher on her table.
Siuan did not quite flinch, but from her stricken expression, quickly smoothed over, you would
never have believed she washed the man’s small-clothes. Without comment she channeled slightly to
reheat the wine in the silver pitcher, quickly filled two clean worked-silver cups, and handed the first
to Egwene. She kept the second, staring at Lord Bryne as she sipped and leaving him to pour for
himself.
Warming her mittened fingers on her own cup, Egwene felt a flash of irritation. Maybe it was
part of Siuan’s long-delayed reaction to the death of her Warder. She still became weepy for no
visible reason now and then, though she tried to hide it. Egwene put the matter out of her head.
Tonight, that was an anthill beside mountains.
“I want to avoid a battle if I can, Lord Bryne. The army is for Tar Valon, not fighting a war here.
Send to arrange a meeting as soon as possible for the Amyrlin Seat with Lord Pelivar and Lady
Arathelle and anyone else you think you should be present. Not here. Our ragged camp won’t impress
them very much. As soon as possible, mind. I wouldn’t object to tomorrow, if it could be set.”
“That’s sooner than I can manage, Mother,” he said mildly. “If I send riders out as soon as I
return to camp, I doubt they can be back with an answer much before tomorrow night.”
“Then I suggest you return quickly.” Light, but her hands and feet felt cold. And the pit of her
stomach, too. But her voice kept its calm. “And I want you to keep that meeting, and the existence of
their army, from the Hall as long as possible.”
This time, she was asking him to take as great a risk as she did. Gareth Bryne was one of the best
generals living, but the Hall chafed that he did not run the army to suit them. They had been grateful
for his name in the beginning, for it helped draw soldiers to their cause. Now the army had more than
thirty thousand armed men, with more coming even since the snows had started, and they thought that
maybe they did not need Lord Gareth Bryne any longer. And of course, there were those who
believed they never had needed him. They would not simply send him away for this. If the Hall chose
to act, he might well go to the headsman for treason.

He did not blink, and he did not ask questions. Perhaps he knew she would not give answers. Or
maybe he thought he knew them. “There isn’t much traffic between my camp and yours, but too many
men know already to keep a secret long. I will do what I can, though.”
As simple as that. The first step down a road that would see her on the Amyrlin Seat in Tar
Valon, or else deliver her firmly into the grasp of the Hall, with nothing left to decide except whether
it was Romanda or Lelaine who told her what to do. Somehow, such a pivotal moment should have
been accompanied by fanfares of trumpets, or at the least, thunder in the sky. It was always that way
in stories.
Egwene let the ball of light vanish, but as Bryne turned to leave, she caught his arm. It was like
catching a thick tree branch through his coat. “A thing I have been meaning to ask you, Lord Bryne.
You can’t want to take men worn down by marching right into a siege of Tar Valon. How long would
you want to rest them before you began?”
For the first time, he paused, and she wished she still had the light to see his face. She thought he
frowned. “Even leaving people in the pay of the Tower out of it,” he said at last, slowly, “news of an
army flies as fast as a falcon. Elaida will know to the day when we’ll arrive, and she won’t give us
an hour. You know she’s increasing the Tower Guard? To fifty thousand men, apparently. But a
month, if I could, to rest and recover. Ten days would do, but a month would be better.”
She nodded, releasing him. That casual question about the Tower Guard hurt. He was aware that
the Hall and the Ajahs told her what they wanted her to know and no more. “I suppose you’re right,”
she said evenly. “There’ll be no time for rest once we reach Tar Valon. Send your fastest riders.
There won’t be any difficulty, will there? Pelivar and Arathelle will hear them out?” She did not
feign the touch of anxiety. More than her plans might be ruined if they had to fight now.
Bryne’s tone did not alter a whit that she could tell, but somehow, he sounded soothing. “So long
as there is light enough for them to see the white feathers, they’ll recognize a truce and listen. I’d
better go, Mother. It’s a long way and hard riding, even for men with extra horses.”
As soon as the tentflap fell behind him, Egwene let out a long breath. Her shoulders were tight,
and she expected her head to start aching any moment. Bryne usually made her feel relaxed, absorbing
his sureness. Tonight, she had had to manipulate him, and she thought he knew it. He was very
observant for a man. But too much was at stake to trust him more, until he made an open declaration.
Maybe an oath like the one Myrelle and the others had given. Bryne followed the Amyrlin, and the
army followed Bryne. If he thought she was going to throw men away uselessly, a few words from
him could hand her to the Hall trussed like a pig on a platter. She drank deeply, feeling the warmth of
the spiced wine spread through her.
“Better for us if they believed,” she muttered. “I wish there was something for them to believe. If
I do nothing else, Siuan, I hope at least I can free us from the Three Oaths.”
“No!” Siuan barked. She sounded scandalized. “Even trying could be disastrous, and if you
succeeded. . . . The Light help us, if you succeeded, you would destroy the White Tower.”
“What are you talking about? I try to follow the Oaths, Siuan, since we’re stuck with them—for
now—but the Oaths won’t help us against the Seanchan. If sisters have to be in danger of their lives
before they can fight back, it’s only a matter of time before we are all dead or collared.” For a
moment she could feel the a’dam around her throat again, turning her into a dog on a leash. A welltrained and obedient dog. She was glad of the darkness, now, hiding her trembles. Shadows obscured
Siuan’s face, save for a soundlessly working jaw.
“Don’t you look at me like that, Siuan.” It was easier to be angry than afraid, easy to mask fear in
anger. She would never be collared like that again! “You’ve taken every advantage since you were

freed from the Oaths. If you hadn’t lied in your teeth, we’d all be in Salidar, without an army, sitting
on our hands and waiting for a miracle. Well, you would be. They’d never have summoned me to be
Amyrlin without your lie about Logain and the Reds. Elaida would reign supreme, and in a year,
nobody would remember how she usurped the Amyrlin Seat. She’d destroy the Tower, for sure. You
know she’d mishandle everything about Rand. I would not be surprised if she had tried to kidnap him
by now, except that she’s concerned with us. Well, maybe not kidnap, but she’d have done something.
Likely, Aes Sedai would be fighting Asha’man today, and never mind Tarmon Gai’don waiting over
the horizon.”
“I have lied when it seemed necessary,” Siuan breathed. “When it seemed expedient.” Her
shoulders hunched, and she sounded as though she were confessing crimes she did not want to admit
to herself. “Sometimes I think it’s become too easy for me to decide that it’s necessary and expedient.
I’ve lied to almost everyone. Except you. But don’t think it hasn’t occurred to me. To nudge you
toward a decision, or away from one. It wasn’t wanting to keep your trust that stopped me.” Siuan’s
hand stretched out in the dark, pleading. “The Light knows what your trust and friendship mean to me,
but it wasn’t that. It wasn’t knowing that you’d have the hide off me in strips, or send me away, if you
found out. I realized that I had to hold on to the Oaths with somebody, or I’d lose myself completely.
So I don’t lie to you, or to Gareth Bryne, whatever it costs. And as soon I can, Mother, I will swear
the Three Oaths on the Oath Rod again.”
“Why?” Egwene asked quietly. Siuan had considered lying to her? She would have had her hide
for that. But her anger was gone. “I don’t condone lying, Siuan. Not normally. It’s just that sometimes,
it really is necessary.” Her time with the Aiel flashed through her mind. “So long as you’re willing to
pay for it, anyway. I’ve seen sisters take on penance for smaller things. You are one of the first of a
new sort of Aes Sedai, Siuan, free and unbound. I believe you when you say you won’t lie to me.” Or
to Lord Bryne? Odd, that. “Why give up your freedom?”
“Give up?” Siuan laughed. “I’ll be giving up nothing.” Her back straightened, and her voice
began to gain strength, and then passion. “The Oaths are what make us more than simply a group of
women meddling in the affairs of the world. Or seven groups. Or fifty. The Oaths hold us together, a
stated set of beliefs that bind us all, a single thread running through every sister, living or dead, back
to the first to lay her hands on the Oath Rod. They are what make us Aes Sedai, not saidar. Any
wilder can channel. Men may look at what we say from six sides, but when a sister says, ‘This is so,’
they know it’s true, and they trust. Because of the Oaths. Because of the Oaths, no queen fears that
sisters will lay waste to her cities. The worst villain knows he’s safe in his life with a sister unless
he tries to harm her. Oh, the Whitecloaks call them lies, and some people have strange ideas about
what the Oaths entail, but there are very few places an Aes Sedai cannot go, and be listened to,
because of the Oaths. The Three Oaths are what it is to be Aes Sedai, the heart of being Aes Sedai.
Throw that on the rubbish heap, and we’ll be sand washing away in the tide. Give up? I will be
gaining.”
Egwene frowned. “And the Seanchan?” What it was to be Aes Sedai. Almost from the day she
first arrived in Tar Valon, she had worked to be Aes Sedai, but she had never really thought about
what it was that made a woman Aes Sedai.
Once more Siuan laughed, though this time it was a touch wry, and weary. She shook her head,
and darkness or no, looked tired. “I don’t know, Mother. The Light help me, I don’t. But we survived
the Trolloc Wars, and Whitecloaks, and Artur Hawkwing, and everything in between. We can find a
way to deal with these Seanchan. Without destroying ourselves.”
Egwene was not so sure. Many of the sisters in camp thought the Seanchan were such a danger

that besieging Elaida should wait. As if waiting would not cement Elaida on the Amyrlin Seat. Many
others seemed to think that simply uniting the White Tower again, at whatever price, would make the
Seanchan vanish. Survival lost some of its attraction if it was survival on a leash, and Elaida’s would
not be much less confining than the Seanchan’s. What it was to be Aes Sedai.
“There’s no need to keep Gareth Bryne at arm’s length,” Siuan said suddenly. “The man’s a
walking tribulation, it’s true. If he doesn’t count as penance for my lies, being flayed alive wouldn’t
do. One of these days, I’ll box his ears every morning and twice at evenings, on general principle, but
you can tell him everything. It would help, if he understood. He’s taking you on trust, and it ties his
stomach in knots, wondering whether you know what you’re doing. He doesn’t let on, but I see.”
Suddenly, pieces clicked in Egwene’s mind like a blacksmith’s puzzle coming undone. Shocking
pieces. Siuan was in love with the man! Nothing else made sense. Everything she knew between them
altered. Not necessarily for the better. A woman in love often put her brains on the shelf when she
was around the man in question. As she herself was all too well aware. Where was Gawyn? Was he
well? Was he warm? Enough of that. Too much, in light of what she had to say. She put on her best
Amyrlin’s voice, sure and in command. “You can box Lord Bryne’s ears or bed him, Siuan, but you
will watch yourself with him. You will not let slip things he mustn’t know yet. Do you understand
me?”
Siuan jerked stiffly erect. “I’m not in the habit of letting my tongue flap like a torn sail, Mother,”
she said heatedly.
“I’m very glad to hear it, Siuan.” Despite their looking only a few years apart, Siuan was old
enough to be her mother yet at that moment Egwene felt as though their ages had been reversed. This
might be the first time that Siuan had ever had to manage with a man not as Aes Sedai, but as a
woman. A few years of thinking I loved Rand, Egwene thought wryly, a few months of dangling by
my toes for Gawyn, and I know all there is to know.
“I think we’re done here,” she went on, slipping an arm through Siuan’s. “Almost. Come.”
The walls of the tent had seemed little protection, yet stepping outside brought a renewed assault
by winter’s teeth. The moonlight was almost bright enough to read by, reflected off the snow, but that
glow seemed cold. Bryne had vanished as if he had never been. Leane appeared long enough to say
she had seen no one, her slimness swallowed in layers of wool, then hurried off into the night looking
about her. No one knew of any connection between Leane and Egwene, and everyone thought Leane
and Siuan were practically at daggers’ points.
Gathering her cloak as best she could one-handed, Egwene focused on ignoring the icy chill as
she and Siuan walked in the opposite direction from Leane. Ignoring the chill, and keeping an eye out
for anyone who happened to be out. Not that anyone who was outside now was likely to be there by
happenstance.
“Lord Bryne was right,” she told Siuan, “about it being better if Pelivar and Arathelle believed
those stories. Or at least if they were uncertain. Too uncertain to fight, or do anything except talk. Do
you think they would welcome a visit from Aes Sedai? Siuan, are you listening to me?”
Siuan gave a start, and stopped staring into the distance ahead of them. She had been walking
ahead without missing a step, but now she slipped and nearly sat down in the frozen path, barely
regaining her balance in time to keep from pulling Egwene down. “Yes, Mother. Of course I’m
listening. They might not be exactly welcoming, but I doubt they’ll turn sisters away.”
“Then I want you to wake Beonin, Anaiya, and Myrelle. They are to ride north inside the hour. If
Lord Bryne expects a reply as soon as tomorrow evening, time is short.” A pity she had not found out
exactly where this other army was located, but asking Bryne might have roused suspicion. Finding it

should not be too hard for Warders, and those three sisters had five between them.
Siuan listened in silence to her instructions. Not only those three were to be rooted out of their
sleep. Come dawn, Sheriam and Carlinya, Morvrin and Nisao would all know what to say over
breakfast. Seeds had to be planted, seeds that could not have been placed earlier for fear of them
sprouting too soon, but now they had all too little time to grow.
“It will be a pleasure to haul them out of their blankets,” Siuan said when she was done. “If I
have to tramp around in this. . . .” Releasing Egwene’s arm, she started to turn away, then stopped,
her face serious, even grim. “I know you want to be a second Gerra Kishar—or maybe Sereille
Bagand. You have it in you to match either. But be careful you don’t turn out to be another Shein
Chunla. Good night, Mother. Sleep well.”
Egwene stood watching her go, a cloak-shrouded figure sometimes skidding on the path and
muttering angrily almost loud enough to make out. Gerra and Sereille were remembered as among the
greatest Amyrlins. Both had raised the influence and prestige of the White Tower to levels seldom
equaled since before Artur Hawkwing. Both controlled the Tower itself, too, Gerra by skillfully
playing one faction in the Hall against another, Sereille by the sheer force of her will. Shein Chunla
was another matter, one who had squandered the power of the Amyrlin Seat, alienating most of the
sisters in the Tower. The world believed that Shein had died in office, close on four hundred years
ago, but the deeply hidden truth was that she had been deposed and sent into exile for life. Even the
secret histories treaded lightly in certain areas, yet it was fairly obvious that, after the fourth plot to
restore her to the Amyrlin Seat was uncovered, the sisters guarding Shein had smothered her in her
sleep with a pillow. Egwene shivered, and told herself it was the cold.
Turning, she began making her slow way back to her tent alone. Sleep well? The fat moon hung
low in the sky, and there were hours yet till sunrise, but she was not sure she was going to be able to
sleep at all.

CHAPTER

Unexpected Absences

B efore the sun made a rim on the horizon the next morning, Egwene convened the Hall of the
Tower. In Tar Valon, that would have been accompanied by considerable ceremony, and even
since leaving Salidar they had held to some despite the difficulties of travel. Now, Sheriam
simply went from Sitter’s tent to Sitter’s tent while it was still dark to announce that the Amyrlin
Seat had called the Hall to Sit. In fact, they did not sit at all. In the grayness just before true
sunrise, eighteen women stood in a semicircle on the snow to hear Egwene, all bundled against
the cold that misted their breath.
Other sisters began appearing behind them to listen, only a few at the start, but when no one told
them to leave, the group thickened and spread out to a soft buzz of talk. A very muted buzz. Few
sisters would risk bothering a lone Sitter, much less the entire Hall. The Accepted in banded dresses
and cloaks who had appeared behind the Aes Sedai were quieter, of course, and even quieter the
gathering novices who had no chores, though there were a good many more of them. The camp now
held half again as many novices as sisters, so many that few possessed a proper white cloak and most
made do with a simple white skirt instead of a novice dress. Some sisters still believed they should
go back to the old ways and let girls seek them out, but most regretted the lost years, when Aes Sedai
numbers dwindled. Egwene herself almost shivered whenever she thought of what the Tower could
have been. This was one change not even Siuan could object to.
In the midst of all the gathering, Carlinya came around the corner of a tent and stopped short at
the sight of Egwene and the Sitters. Normally composure to her toenails, the White sister gaped, and
her pale face reddened before she hurried away, looking back over her shoulder. Egwene stifled a
grimace. Everyone was too concerned with what she herself was about this morning to have noticed,
but sooner or later, someone was going to, and wonder.
Flinging back her delicately embroidered cloak to reveal the narrow blue stole of the Keeper,
Sheriam made Egwene as much of a formal curtsy as her bulky garments allowed before taking a
place at her side. Wrapped in layers of fine wool and silk, the flame-haired woman was the very
picture of equanimity. At Egwene’s nod, she took one step forward to intone the ancient formula in a
clear, high voice.
“She comes; she comes! The Watcher of the Seals, the Flame of Tar Valon, the Amyrlin Seat.

Attend you all, for she comes!” It seemed a little out of place here, and besides, she was already
there, not coming. The Sitters stood in silence, waiting. A few frowned impatiently, or fiddled
restlessly with cloaks or skirts.
Egwene pushed back her own cloak, uncovering the seven-striped stole draped around her neck.
These women needed any reminder she could give that she was indeed the Amyrlin Seat. “Everyone
is weary from travel in this weather,” she announced, not quite so loudly as Sheriam, but loud enough
that everyone could hear. She felt a tingle of anticipation, an almost light-headed thrill. It was not
much different from being queasy. “I have decided to stop here for two days, perhaps three.” That
brought heads up and sparked interest. She hoped Siuan was in the listening crowd. She did try to
hold to the Oaths. “The horses need rest, too, and many of the wagons badly need repairs. The Keeper
will see to the necessary arrangements.” It truly was begun, now.
She expected neither argument nor discussion, and there was none. What she had told Siuan was
no exaggeration. Too many sisters hoped for a miracle, so they would not have to march on Tar Valon
with the world watching. Even among those convinced in their souls that Elaida must be ousted for
the good of the Tower, despite everything they had done, too many would grasp any chance of delay,
any chance for that miracle to appear.
One of those last, Romanda, did not wait for Sheriam to speak the closing lines. As soon as
Egwene finished speaking, Romanda, looking quite youthful with her tight gray bun hidden by her
hood, simply strode away. Cloaks flapping, Magla, Saroiya, and Varilin scurried after her. As well
as anyone could scurry, when every other step sank ankle-deep. They did a good job of it anyway;
Sitters or no, they hardly seemed to breathe without Romanda’s permission. When Lelaine saw
Romanda leaving, she gathered up Faiselle, Takima, and Lyrelle from the semicircle with a gesture
and went without a backward glance, like a swan with three anxious goslings. If they were not so
firmly in Lelaine’s grasp as the other three were in Romanda’s, they did not fall far short. For that
matter, the rest of the Sitters barely waited on the final “Depart now in the Light” to leave Sheriam’s
lips. Egwene turned to go with her Hall of the Tower already scattering in every direction. That tingle
was stronger. And very like being queasy.
“Three days,” Sheriam murmured, offering Egwene a hand to help her down into one of the
rutted paths. The corners of her tilted green eyes crinkled quizzically. “I’m surprised, Mother.
Forgive me, but you dug in your heels nearly every time I wanted to stop for more than one.”
“Speak to me again after you’ve talked to the wheelwrights and farriers,” Egwene told her.
“We’ll not go far with horses dropping dead and wagons falling apart.”
“As you say, Mother,” the other woman replied, not precisely meekly, but in perfect acceptance.
The footing was no better now than it had been the night before, and their steps sometimes slid.
Linking arms, they walked on slowly. Sheriam offered more support than Egwene required, but she
did so almost surreptitiously. The Amyrlin Seat should not fall on her bottom in the full view of fifty
sisters and a hundred servants, but neither should she seem propped up like an invalid.
Most of the Sitters who had sworn to Egwene, Sheriam included, had done so out of simple fear,
really, and self-preservation. If the Hall learned they had sent sisters to sway the Aes Sedai in Tar
Valon, and worse, kept the fact from the Hall for fear of Darkfriends among the Sitters, they surely
and certainly would spend the rest of their lives in penance and exile. So the women who had
believed they could somehow twitch Egwene about like a puppet, after the greater part of their
influence with the Hall melted, instead found themselves sworn to obey her. That was rare even in the
secret histories; sisters were expected to obey the Amyrlin, but swearing fealty was something else
again. Most still seemed unsettled by it, though they did obey. Few were as bad as Carlinya, but

Egwene had actually heard Beonin’s teeth chatter the first time she saw Egwene with Sitters after
swearing. Morvrin looked astonished anew whenever her eyes fell on Egwene, as if she still did not
quite believe, and Nisao hardly seemed to stop frowning. Anaiya clicked her tongue over the secrecy,
and Myrelle often flinched, though for more reason than taking an oath. But Sheriam simply had
settled into the role of Egwene’s Keeper of the Chronicles in truth, not just name.
“May I suggest using this opportunity to see what the surrounding country offers in way of food
and fodder, Mother? Our stocks are low.” Sheriam frowned anxiously. “Especially tea and salt,
though I doubt we’ll find those.”
“Do what you can,” Egwene said in a soothing tone. Odd now, to think that once she had gone in
awe of Sheriam, and in no little fear of her displeasure. Strange as it seemed, now that she was no
longer Mistress of Novices, no longer trying to tug and push Egwene to do as she wished, Sheriam
actually seemed happier. “I have every confidence in you, Sheriam.” The woman positively beamed
at the compliment.
The sun still did not show above the tents and wagons to the east, but the camp was already
bustling. In a manner of speaking. Breakfast done, the cooks were cleaning up, helped by a horde of
novices. From the vigor they put into it, the young women seemed to find some warmth in scrubbing
kettles with snow, but the cooks moved laboriously, knuckling their backs, stopping to sigh and
sometimes to pull their cloaks close and stare bleakly at the snow. Shivering serving men, wearing
most of the clothes they owned, had begun striking tents and loading wagons automatically as soon as
they finished their hasty meal, and were now stumbling about to raise the tents and haul chests out of
the wagons. Animals that had been being harnessed were now being led away by weary
horsehandlers who walked with heads down. Egwene heard a few grumbles from men who failed to
notice there were sisters nearby, but the greater number seemed too tired to voice a complaint.
Most of the Aes Sedai whose tents were up had vanished inside, but a good many still directed
workers, and others hurried along the sunken paths on errands of their own. Unlike everyone else,
they showed as little outward weariness as the Warders, who somehow managed to appear as if they
had had all the sleep they needed for this fine spring day. Egwene suspected that was a real part of
how a sister drew strength from her Warder, quite aside from what she could do with the bond. When
your Warder would not admit to himself that he was cold or tired or hungry, you just had to bear up as
well.
On one of the crossing paths, Morvrin appeared, clutching Takima’s arm. Perhaps it was for
support, though Morvrin was wide enough to make the shorter woman seem more diminutive than she
actually was. Perhaps it was to keep Takima from escaping; Morvrin was dogged once she set a goal.
Egwene frowned. Morvrin might well be expected to seek out a Sitter for her Ajah, the Brown, yet
Egwene would have thought Janya or Escaralde more likely. The two passed out of sight behind a
canvas-topped wagon on runners, Morvrin bending to talk in her companion’s ear. There was no way
to tell whether Takima was paying any mind.
“Is something the matter, Mother?”
Egwene put on a smile that felt tight. “No more than usual, Sheriam. No more than usual.”
At the Amyrlin’s Study, Sheriam departed to see to the tasks Egwene had given her, and Egwene
went in to find everything in readiness. She would have been surprised at anything else. Selame was
just setting a tea tray on the writing table. Brightly colored beadwork ran across the rail-thin woman’s
bodice and down her sleeves, and with her long nose carried high, she hardly seemed a servant at
first glance, but she had seen to what needed doing. Two braziers full of glowing coals had taken
some of the chill off the air, though most of the heat rushed out through the smoke hole. Dried herbs

sprinkled on the coals gave a pleasant scent to the smoke that did not escape, the tray from the night
before was gone, and the lantern and tallow candles had been trimmed and lit. No one was about to
leave a tent open enough to let in light from outside.
Siuan was already there, too, with a stack of papers in her hands, a harried expression on her
face, and a smudge of ink on her nose. The post of secretary provided the two of them another reason
to be seen talking, and Sheriam had not minded at all giving up the work. Siuan herself grumbled
frequently, however. For a woman who had seldom left the Tower since entering as a novice, she had
a remarkable dislike for staying inside. At the moment she was the picture of a woman being patient
and wanting everyone to know it.
For all her high nose, Selame simpered and bobbed so many curtsies that taking Egwene’s cloak
and mittens turned into an elaborate little ceremony. The woman nattered on about the Mother putting
her feet up, and perhaps she should fetch the Mother a lap robe, and maybe she should stay in case the
Mother wanted anything else, until Egwene practically chased her out. The tea tasted of mint. In this
weather! Selame was a trial, and she could hardly be called loyal, but she did try.
There was no time for lounging and sipping tea, though. Egwene straightened her stole and took
her place behind the writing desk, absentmindedly giving a yank to the leg of her chair so it would not
fold beneath her as it often did, Siuan perched atop a rickety stool on the other side of the table, and
the tea cooled. They did not speak of plans, or Gareth Bryne, or hopes; what could be done there for
now, had been. Reports and problems piled up when they were on the move and weariness overcame
attempts to deal with them, and now that they were stopped, all had to be gone through. An army
ahead did not change that.
At times, Egwene wondered how so much paper could be found when everything else seemed so
difficult. The reports Siuan handed her detailed shortages and little else. Not simply those Sheriam
had mentioned, but coal and nails and iron for the farriers and wheelwrights, leather and oiled thread
for the harnessmakers, lamp oil and candles and a hundred other things, even soap. And whatever was
not running out was wearing out, from shoes to tents, all listed in Siuan’s bold hand, which grew more
aggressive the more glaring the need she wrote about. Her account of the coin remaining looked to
have been slashed onto the paper in a positive fury. And not a thing to be done about it.
Among Siuan’s papers were several addresses from Sitters suggesting ways to solve the
problem of money. Or rather, informing Egwene what they intended to lay before the Hall. There
were few advantages to any of the schemes, however, and many pitfalls. Moria Karentanis proposed
stopping the soldiers’ pay, a notion Egwene thought the Hall had already realized would cause the
army to melt away like dew under a midsummer sun. Malind Nachenin presented an appeal to nearby
nobles that sounded more a demand and might well turn the whole countryside against them, as would
Salita Toranes’ intention to levy a tax on the towns and villages they passed.
Crumpling the three addresses together in her fist, Egwene shook them at Siuan. She wished it
were three Sitters’ throats she was gripping. “Do they all think everything has to go the way they
wish, and never mind realities? Light, they’re the ones behaving like children!”
“The Tower has managed to make its wishes become realities often enough,” Siuan said
complacently. “Remember, some would say you’re ignoring reality, too.”
Egwene sniffed. Luckily, whatever the Hall voted, none of the proposals could be carried
forward without a decree from her. Even in her straitened circumstances, she had a little power. Very
little, but that was more than none. “Is the Hall always this bad, Siuan?”
Siuan nodded, shifting slightly to try to find a better balance. No two of her stool’s legs were the
same length. “But it could be worse. Remind me to tell you about the Year of the Four Amyrlins; that

was about a hundred and fifty years after the founding of Tar Valon. In those days, the normal
workings of the Tower nearly rivaled what’s happening today. Every hand tried to snatch the tiller, if
they could. There were actually two rival Halls of the Tower in Tar Valon for part of that year.
Almost like now. Just about everyone came to grief in the end, including a few who thought they were
going to save the Tower. Some of them might have, if they hadn’t stepped in quicksand. The Tower
survived anyway, of course. It always does.”
A great deal of history grew up in over three thousand years, much suppressed, hidden from all
but a few eyes, yet Siuan seemed to have every detail at her fingertips. She must have spent a good
part of her years in the Tower burying herself in those secret histories. Of one thing, Egwene was
certain. She would avoid Shein’s fate if she could, but she would not remain as she was, little better
off than Cemaile Sorenthaine. Long before the end of her reign, the most important decision left to
Cemaile’s discretion was what dress to wear. She was going to have to ask Siuan to tell her about the
Year of the Four Amyrlins, and she did not look forward to it.
The shifting beam of light from the smoke hole in the roof showed morning toward midday, but
Siuan’s stack of papers seemed hardly diminished. Any interruption at all would have been welcome,
even premature discovery. Well, maybe not that.
“What’s next, Siuan?” she growled.
A flicker of movement caught Aran’gar’s eye, and she peered through the trees toward the
army’s camp, an obscuring ring around the tents of the Aes Sedai. A line of wagon-sledges was
moving slowly east, escorted by men on horseback. The pale sun glinted from armor and the points of
lances. She could not help sneering. Spears and horses! A primitive rabble that could move no faster
than a man could walk, led by a man who did not know what was happening a hundred miles away.
Aes Sedai? She could destroy the lot of them, and even dying they would never suspect who was
killing them. Of course, she would not survive them long. That thought made her shiver. The Great
Lord gave very few a second chance at life, and she was not about to throw away hers.
Waiting until the riders moved out of sight into the forest, she started back toward the camp,
thinking idly of tonight’s dreams. Behind her, smooth snow would hide what she had buried until the
spring thaw, more than long enough. Ahead, some of the men in the camp finally noticed her and
straightened from their tasks to watch. In spite of herself, she smiled and smoothed her skirt over her
hips. It was difficult now to really remember what life had been like as a man; had she been such an
easily manipulated fool, then? Getting through that swarm with a corpse unseen had been difficult,
even for her, but she enjoyed the walk back.
The morning went on in a seemingly endless wading through paper, until what Egwene had
known would happen, did. Certain daily events were sure. There would be bitter cold, there would
be snow, there would be clouds, and gray skies, and wind. And there would be visits from Lelaine
and Romanda.
Weary of sitting, Egwene was stretching her legs when Lelaine swept into the tent with Faolain
at her heels. Frigid air rolled in with them before the tentflap fell shut. Looking around with a faintly
disapproving air, Lelaine plucked off blue leather gloves, while allowing Faolain to remove the lynxlined cloak from her shoulders. Slender and dignified in deep blue silk, with penetrating eyes, she
might have been in her own tent. At a casual gesture, Faolain retreated deferentially to a corner with
the garment, merely shrugging her own cloak back. Plainly, she was ready to go on the instant at
another wave of the Sitter’s hand. Her dark features wore a cast of resigned meekness, not very much
like her.
Lelaine’s reserve cracked for a moment, in a surprisingly warm smile for Siuan. They had been

friends, once, years ago, and she had even offered something like the patronage that Faolain had
accepted, a Sitter’s protection and sheltering arm against the sneers and accusations of other sisters.
Touching Siuan’s cheek, Lelaine softly murmured something that sounded sympathetic. Siuan blushed,
a startling uncertainty flashing across her face. It was not pretense, Egwene was sure. Siuan found it
difficult to deal with what really had changed in her, and more, with how easily she was adapting.
Lelaine eyed the stool in front of the writing table and, as usual, visibly rejected such an
unsteady seat. Only then did she acknowledge Egwene’s presence, with the barest dip of her head.
“We need to speak of the Sea Folk, Mother,” she said in a tone a bit firm to be directed at the Amyrlin
Seat.
Not until Egwene’s heart sank down from her throat did she realize she had been afraid that
Lelaine already knew what Lord Bryne had told her. Or even the meeting he was arranging. The next
instant, her heart leaped back again. The Sea Folk? Surely the Hall could not have learned of the
insane bargain Nynaeve and Elayne had made. She could not imagine what had led them into such a
disaster, or how she was to deal with it.
Her stomach roiling, she took her place behind the table without revealing anything of what she
felt. And that fool chair leg folded, nearly dropping her onto the carpets before she could jerk it
straight again. She hoped her cheeks were not coloring. “The Sea Folk in Caemlyn, or in Cairhien?”
Yes; that sounded suitably calm and collected.
“Cairhien.” Romanda’s high voice rang like sudden chimes. “Definitely Cairhien.” Her entry
made Lelaine’s seem almost diffident, the force of her personality abruptly filling the tent. There were
no warm smiles in Romanda; handsome as her face was, it did not seem made for them.
Theodrin followed her in, and Romanda swung her cloak off with a flourish and tossed it to the
slim, apple-cheeked sister with a peremptory gesture that sent Theodrin hurrying to a corner opposite
Faolain. Faolain was distinctly subdued, but Theodrin’s tilted eyes were very wide, as though she
was permanently startled, and her lips seemed ready to gasp. Like Faolain, her proper place in the
hierarchy of Aes Sedai demanded better employment, but neither was likely to receive it soon.
Romanda’s compelling gaze rested a moment on Siuan, as if considering whether to send her to a
corner as well, then brushed past Lelaine almost dismissively before settling on Egwene. “It seems
that young man has been talking with the Sea Folk, Mother. The Yellow eyes-and-ears in Cairhien are
most excited about it. Do you have any idea what might interest him in the Atha’an Miere?”
Despite the title, Romanda hardly sounded as if she were addressing the Amyrlin Seat, but then,
she never did. There was no doubt who “that young man” was. Every sister in the camp accepted that
Rand was the Dragon Reborn, but anyone who heard them talk would have believed they were
speaking of an unruly young lout who might come to dinner drunk and throw up on the table.
“She can hardly know what’s in the boy’s head,” Lelaine said before Egwene could open her
mouth. Her smile was not at all warm this time. “If an answer is to be found, Romanda, it will be in
Caemlyn. The Atha’an Miere there are not sequestered on a ship, and I seriously doubt that high
ranking Sea Folk came so far from the sea on different errands. I’ve never heard of them doing so for
any reason. It may be they have an interest in him. They must know who he is by now.”
Romanda smiled back, and frost should have appeared on the tent walls. “There’s hardly need to
state the obvious, Lelaine. The first question is how to find out.”
“I was about to resolve that when you barged in, Romanda. The next time the Mother encounters
Elayne or Nynaeve in Tel’aran’rhiod, she can pass on instructions. Merilille can discover what the
Atha’an Miere want, or maybe what the boy does, when she reaches Caemlyn. A pity the girls didn’t
think to set a regular schedule, but we must work around that. Merilille can meet with a Sitter in

Tel’aran’rhiod when she knows.” Lelaine made a small gesture; plainly, she herself was the intended
Sitter. “I thought Salidar might be a suitable place.”
Romanda snorted with amusement. Even in that, there was no warmth. “Easier to instruct
Merilille than to see she obeys, Lelaine. I expect she knows she faces sharp questions. This Bowl of
the Winds should have been brought to us for study first. None of the sisters in Ebou Dar had much
ability in Cloud Dancing, I believe, and you can see the result, all this hurly-burly and suddenness. I
have a thought to call a question before the Hall concerning everyone involved.” Abruptly the grayhaired woman’s voice became smooth as butter. “As I recall, you supported the choice of Merilille.”
With a jerk, Lelaine drew herself up. Her eyes flashed. “I supported who the Gray put forward,
Romanda, and no more,” she said indignantly. “How could I have imagined she would decide to use
the Bowl there? And to include Sea Folk wilders in the circle! How could she believe they know as
much of working weather as Aes Sedai?” Abruptly her ire slipped. She was defending herself to her
fiercest adversary in the Hall, her only real adversary. And, no doubt worse in her view, she was
agreeing with her about the Sea Folk. There was no question that she did agree, but giving the fact
voice was another matter.
Romanda let her cold smile deepen as Lelaine’s face paled with fury. She straightened her
bronze-colored skirts with meticulous care as Lelaine searched for a way to turn matters about. “We
will see how the Hall stands, Lelaine,” she said finally. “Until the question is called, I think it best if
Merilille does not meet with any of the Sitters involved in her selection. Even a suggestion of
collusion would be looked at askance. I’m sure you will agree I should be the one to speak with her.”
Lelaine’s face paled differently. She was not afraid, not visibly, yet Egwene could almost see
her counting who might stand for her, or against. Collusion was almost as serious as a charge of
treason, and required only the lesser consensus. Likely, she could avoid that, but the arguments would
be deep and acrimonious. Romanda’s faction might even increase. That would cause untold problems
whether or not Egwene’s own plans bore fruit. And there was nothing she could do to stop it, short of
revealing what really had happened in Ebou Dar. As well ask them to let her accept the same offer
Faolain and Theodrin had.
Egwene drew breath. At least she might be able to prevent the use of Salidar as a meeting place
in Tel’aran’rhiod. That was where she met Elayne and Nynaeve, now. When she did, anyway; she
had not in days. With Sitters popping in and out of the World of Dreams, finding anywhere you could
be sure they would not appear was difficult. “The next time I encounter Elayne or Nynaeve, I will
pass on your instructions regarding Merilille. I can let you know when she’s ready to meet you.”
Which would be never, once she was done with those instructions.
The Sitters’ heads whipped around, and two sets of eyes stared at her. They had forgotten she
was there! Struggling to keep her face smooth, she realized her foot was tapping irritably, and
stopped it. She had to go along with what they thought of her a while longer, yet. A little while longer.
At least she no longer felt nauseated. Just angry.
Into that moment of silence, Chesa came bustling with Egwene’s midday meal on a clothcovered tray. Dark-haired, plump and pretty in her middle years, Chesa managed to convey a proper
respect without cringing. Her curtsy was as simple as her dark gray dress, with just a touch of plain
lace at the throat. “Forgive me for intruding, Mother, Aes Sedai. I am sorry this is late, Mother, but
Meri seems to have wandered off.” She clicked her tongue in exasperation as she set the tray in front
of Egwene. Wandering seemed very unlike the misnamed Meri. That dour woman was as
disapproving of faults in herself as she was of those in others.
Romanda frowned, but she said nothing. After all, she could hardly show too much interest in

one of Egwene’s maids. Especially when the woman was her spy. Just as Selame was Lelaine’s.
Egwene avoided looking at Theodrin or Faolain, both still standing dutifully in their corners like
Accepted, rather than Aes Sedai themselves.
Chesa half-opened her mouth, but closed it again, perhaps intimidated by the Sitters. Egwene
was relieved when she dipped another curtsy and left with a murmured “By your leave, Mother.”
Chesa’s advice was always indirect enough for any sister when anyone else was present, but right
then, the last thing Egwene wanted was even a circumspect reminder to eat while her food was hot.
Lelaine took up as if there had been no interruption. “The important thing,” she said firmly, “is to
learn what the Atha’an Miere want. Or what the boy does. Maybe he wants to be their king, too.”
Holding out her arms, she allowed Faolain to restore her cloak, which the dark young woman did
with care. “You will remember to let me know if you have any thoughts on it, Mother?” That was just
barely a request.
“I will think hard,” Egwene told her. Which was not to say she would share her thoughts. She
wished she had a glimmer of the answer. That the Atha’an Miere believed Rand was their prophesied
Coramoor, she knew, though the Hall did not, but what he wanted from them, or them from him, she
could not begin to imagine. According to Elayne, the Sea Folk with them had no clue. Or said not.
Egwene almost wished one of the handful of sisters who had come from the Atha’an Miere was in the
camp. Almost. One way or another, those Windfinders were going to cause trouble.
At a wave of Romanda’s hand, Theodrin leaped forward with the Sitter’s cloak as though
goosed. By Romanda’s expression, Lelaine’s recovery did not best please her. “You will remember
to tell Merilille I wish to speak with her, Mother,” she said, and that was not a request at all.
For a brief moment the two Sitters stood staring at each other, Egwene forgotten again in their
mutual animosity. They departed without a word to her, very nearly jostling for precedence before
Romanda slipped out first, drawing Theodrin in her wake. Baring her teeth, Lelaine practically
pushed Faolain from the tent ahead of her.
Siuan heaved a hearty sigh, and made no attempt to hide her relief.
“By your leave, Mother,” Egwene muttered mockingly. “If you please, Mother. You may go,
daughters.” Letting out a long breath, she settled back in her chair. Which promptly pitched her onto
the carpets in a heap. She picked herself up slowly and jerked her skirts straight, put her stole to
rights. At least it had not happened in front of those two. “Go get something to eat, Siuan. And bring it
back. We’ve a long day, yet.”
“Some falls hurt less than others,” Siuan said as if to herself before ducking outside. It was a
good thing she went so quickly, or Egwene might have given her an earful.
She returned soon, though, and they ate hard rolls and lentil stew laced with tough carrot and
scraps of meat Egwene did not look at closely. There were only a few interruptions, intrusions where
they fell silent and pretended to study reports. Chesa came to take away the tray, and later to replace
the candles, a task she grumbled over, which was not like her.
“Who’d expect Selame to go missing, too?” she muttered, half to herself. “Off canoodling with
the soldiers, I expect. That Halima’s a bad influence.”
A skinny young fellow with a dripping nose renewed the already dead coals in the braziers—the
Amyrlin got more warmth than most, but that was not a great deal—and he stumbled over his own
boots and gaped at Egwene in a manner quite gratifying after the two Sitters. Sheriam appeared to ask
whether Egwene had any further instructions, of all things, and then seemed to want to stay. Perhaps
the few secrets she knew made her nervous; her eyes certainly darted uneasily.
That was the lot, and Egwene was not sure whether it was because no one bothered the Amyrlin

without cause, or because everyone knew the real decisions were made in the Hall.
“I don’t know about this report of soldiers moving south out of Kandor,” Siuan said as soon as
the tentflap fell behind Sheriam. “There’s just the one, and Borderlanders seldom go far from the
Blight, but every fool knows that, so it’s hardly the kind of tale anyone would make up.” She was not
reading from a page, now.
Siuan had managed to keep very tenuous control of the Amyrlin’s network of eyes-and-ears so
far, and reports, rumors, and gossip flowed to her in steady streams, to be studied before she and
Egwene decided what to pass on to the Hall. Leane had her own network, to add to the flow. Most of
it was passed on—some things the Hall had to know, and there was no guarantee that the Ajahs would
pass on what their own agents learned—but it all had to be sieved for what might be dangerous, or
serve to divert attention from the real goal.
Few of those streams carried anything good, of late. Cairhien had produced any number of
rumors of Aes Sedai allied with Rand, or, worse, serving him, yet at least those could be dismissed
out of hand. The Wise Ones would not say much at all about Rand or anyone connected to him, but
according to them, Merana was awaiting his return, and certainly sisters in the Sun Palace, where the
Dragon Reborn kept his first throne, were more than seed enough to grow those tales. Others were not
easily ignored, even when it was hard to know what to make of them. A printer in Illian asserted that
he had proof Rand had killed Mattin Stepaneos with his own hands and destroyed the body with the
One Power, while a laborer on the docks there claimed she had seen the former King carried, bound
and gagged and rolled in a rug, aboard a ship that had sailed in the night with the blessings of the
captain of the Port Watch. The first was far more likely, but Egwene hoped none of the Ajahs’ agents
had picked up the same tale. There were already too many black marks against Rand’s name in the
sisters’ books.
It went on like that. The Seanchan seemed to be taking a firm hold in Ebou Dar, against very
little resistance. That might have been expected in a land where the Queen’s true rule ended a few
days’ ride from her capital, yet it was hardly heartening. The Shaido seemed to be everywhere,
though word of them always came from someone who had heard from someone who had heard. Most
sisters seemed to believe the scattered Shaido were Rand’s work despite the Wise Ones’ denials,
carried by Sheriam. No one wanted to probe the Wise Ones’ supposed lies too closely, of course.
There were a hundred excuses, but no one was willing to meet them in Tel’aran’rhiod except the
sisters sworn to Egwene, and they had to be ordered. Anaiya dryly called the encounters “quite
compact lessons in humility,” and she did not seem at all amused.
“There can’t be that many Shaido,” Egwene muttered. No herbs had been added to the second
batch of charcoal, which was dying down in faint embers, and her eyes ached from the smoke that
hung thin in the air. Channeling to get rid of it would disperse the last warmth, too. “Some of this must
be bandits’ work.” After all, who could tell a village emptied by people fleeing brigands from one
emptied by Shaido? Especially at third hand, or fifth. “There are certainly enough bandits around to
account for some of it.” Most calling themselves Dragonsworn, which was no help at all. She worked
her shoulders to loosen a few of the knots in her muscles.
Abruptly she realized that Siuan was staring at nothing so intently that she appeared ready to slip
off of her stool. “Siuan, are you falling asleep? We may have worked most of the day, but it’s still
light out.” There was light at the smoke hole, though it did appear to be fading.
Siuan blinked. “I’m sorry. I’ve been thinking about something lately, and trying to decide
whether to share it with you. About the Hall.”
“The Hall! Siuan, if you know something about the Hall—!”

“I don’t know anything,” Siuan cut in. “It’s what I suspect.” She clicked her tongue in annoyance.
“Not even suspect, really. At least, I don’t know what to suspect. But I see a pattern.”
“Then you had best tell me about it,” Egwene said. Siuan had shown herself very skilled at
detecting patterns where others saw only a jumble.
Shifting on her stool, Siuan leaned forward intently. “It’s this. Aside from Romanda and Moria,
the Sitters chosen in Salidar are . . . they’re too young.” Much had changed in Siuan, but speaking of
other sisters’ ages clearly made her uncomfortable. “Escaralde is the oldest, and I’m sure she isn’t
much past seventy. I can’t be certain without going into the novice book in Tar Valon, or her telling
us, but I’m as sure as I can be. It isn’t often the Hall has held more than one Sitter under a hundred,
and here we have eight!”
“But Romanda and Moria are new,” Egwene said gently, resting her elbows on the table. It had
been a long day. “And neither is young. Maybe we should be grateful the others are, or they might not
have been willing to raise me.” She could have pointed out that Siuan herself had been chosen
Amyrlin at less than half Escaralde’s age, but the reminder would have been cruel.
“Maybe,” Siuan said stubbornly. “Romanda was certain for the Hall as soon as she showed up. I
doubt there’s a Yellow would dare speak against her for a chair. And Moria. . . . She doesn’t cling to
Lelaine, but Lelaine and Lyrelle probably thought she would. I don’t know. Mark me, though. When a
woman is raised too young, there’s a reason.” She took a deep breath. “Including when I was.” The
pain of loss flashed across her face, the loss of the Amyrlin Seat certainly, maybe of all the losses she
had suffered. It was gone almost as soon as it came. Egwene did not think she had ever known a
woman as strong as Siuan Sanche. “This time, there were more than enough sisters of proper age to
choose from, and I can’t see five Ajahs deadlocking on all of them. There is a pattern, and I mean to
pick it out.”
Egwene did not agree. Change hung in the air whether Siuan wanted to see it or not. Elaida had
broken custom, come very close to breaking law, in usurping Siuan’s place. Sisters had fled the
Tower and let the world know of it, and that last certainly had never happened before. Change. Older
sisters were more likely to be tied to the old ways, but even some of them had to see that everything
was shifting. Surely that was why younger women, more open to the new, had been chosen. Should
she order Siuan to stop wasting her time with this? Siuan had enough else to do. Or would it be a
kindness to let her continue? She wanted so deeply to prove that the change she saw was not really
occurring at all.
Before Egwene could make a decision, Romanda ducked into the tent and stood holding the
tentflap open. Long shadows stretched across the snow outside. Evening was coming fast. Romanda’s
face was as dark as those shadows. She fixed Siuan with a stern gaze and snapped one word. “Out!”
Egwene gave an infinitesimal nod, but Siuan was already on her feet. She missed a step, then all
but ran from the tent. A sister who stood where Siuan did was expected to obey any sister of
Romanda’s strength in the Power, not just a Sitter.
Throwing down the tentflap, Romanda embraced the Source. The glow of saidar surrounded her,
and she wove a ward against eavesdropping around the inside of the tent without so much as a
pretense of asking Egwene’s permission. “You are a fool!” she grated. “How long did you think you
could keep this a secret? Soldiers talk, child. Men always talk! Bryne will be lucky if the Hall
doesn’t put his head on a pike.”
Egwene stood slowly, smoothing her skirt. She had been waiting for this, but she still needed to
be careful. The game was far from played out, and everything could still turn against her in a flash.
She had to pretend innocence, until she could afford to stop pretending. “Must I remind you that

rudeness to the Amyrlin Seat is a crime, daughter,” she said instead. She had been pretending so long,
and she was so close.
“The Amyrlin Seat.” Romanda strode across the carpets to within arm’s reach of Egwene, and
by her glare, the thought of reaching more crossed her mind. “You’re an infant! Your bottom still
remembers the last switching it had as a novice! After this, you’ll be lucky if the Hall doesn’t put you
in a corner with a few play pretties. If you want to avoid that, you will listen to me, and do as I tell
you. Now, sit down!”
Egwene seethed inside, but she sat. It was too soon.
With a sharp, satisfied nod, Romanda planted her fists on her hips. She stared down at Egwene
like a stern aunt lecturing a misbehaving niece. A very stern aunt. Or a headsman with a toothache.
“This meeting with Pelivar and Arathelle has to go forward, now it’s been arranged. They expect the
Amyrlin Seat, and they will see her. You will attend with all the pomp and dignity your title deserves.
And you will tell them I am to speak for you, after which, you will hold your tongue! Getting them out
of our way will require a firm hand, and someone who knows what she’s about. No doubt Lelaine
will be here any minute, trying to put herself forward, but you just remember the trouble she’s in. I’ve
spent the day speaking with other Sitters, and it appears very likely that Merilille and Merana’s
failures will be quite firmly attached to Lelaine when the Hall sits next. So, if you have any hope of
gaining the experience you’ll need to grow into that stole, it lies with me! Do you understand me?”
“I understand perfectly,” Egwene said, in what she hoped was a meek voice. If she let Romanda
speak in her place, there would no longer be any doubts. The Hall and the whole world would know
who held Egwene al’Vere by the scruff of her neck.
Romanda’s eyes seemed to bore into her head before the woman gave a curt nod. “I hope that
you do. I intend to remove Elaida from the Amyrlin Seat, and I won’t see that ruined because a child
thinks she knows enough to find her way across the street without her hand held.” With a snort, she
flung her cloak around her and flung herself out of the tent. The ward vanished as she did.
Egwene sat and frowned at the tent’s entrance. A child? Burn the woman, she was the Amyrlin
Seat! Whether they liked it or not, they had raised her, and they were going to have to live with it!
Eventually. Snatching up the stone inkwell, she hurled it at the tentflap.
Lelaine dodged back, barely avoiding the splash. “Temper, temper,” she chided, coming on in.
No more asking permission than Romanda had, she embraced the Source and wove a ward to
stop anyone overhearing what she had to say. Where Romanda had been in a fury, Lelaine appeared
pleased with herself, rubbing her gloved hands and smiling.
“I don’t suppose I need tell you your little secret is out. Very bad of Lord Bryne, but I think he’s
too valuable to kill. A good thing for him I do. Let me see. I suppose Romanda told you that there will
be a meeting with Pelivar and Arathelle, but you are to let her do all the talking. Am I right?” Egwene
stirred, but Lelaine waved a hand at her. “No need to answer. I know Romanda. Unfortunately for her,
I learned about this before she did, and instead of running to you straightaway, I’ve been polling the
other Sitters. Do you want to know what they think?”
Egwene balled her fists in her lap, where she hoped they would not be noticed. “I expect you’re
going to tell me.”
“You are in no position to take that tone with me,” Lelaine said sharply, but the next instant, her
smile returned. “The Hall is displeased with you. Very displeased. Whatever Romanda has
threatened you with—and it’s easy enough to imagine—I can deliver. Romanda, on the other hand,
has upset a number of Sitters with her bullying. So, unless you want to find yourself with less
authority than the little you have now, Romanda is going to be surprised tomorrow when you name me

to speak for you. It’s hard to believe Arathelle and Pelivar were foolish enough to put a thing like this
in motion, but they’ll slink away with their tails between their legs once I’m done with them.”
“How do I know you won’t carry out those threats anyway?” Egwene hoped her angry mutter
sounded like sullenness. Light, but she was tired of this!
“Because I say I won’t,” Lelaine snapped. “Don’t you know by now that you aren’t really in
charge of anything? The Hall is, and that is between Romanda and me. In another hundred years, you
may grow into the stole, but for now, sit quietly, fold your hands, and let someone who knows what
she is about see to pulling Elaida down.”
After Lelaine left, Egwene once more sat staring. This time, she was not letting anger boil. You
may grow into the stole. Almost the same thing Romanda had said. Someone who knows what she is
about. Was she deceiving herself? A child, ruining what a woman with experience could handle
easily?
Siuan slipped into the tent and stood looking worried. “Gareth Bryne just came to tell me the
Hall knows,” she said dryly. “Under cover of asking about his shirts. Him and his bloody shirts! The
meeting is set for tomorrow, at a lake about five hours to the north. Pelivar and Arathelle are already
on the way. Aemlyn, too. That’s a third strong House.”
“That’s more than Lelaine or Romanda saw fit to tell me,” Egwene said, just as dryly. No. A
hundred years of being led by the hand, pushed by the scruff of her neck, or fifty years, or five, and
she would be fit for nothing more. If she had to grow, she had to grow now.
“Oh, blood and bloody ashes,” Siuan groaned. “I can’t stand it! What did they say? How did it
go?”
“About as we expected.” Egwene smiled with a wonder that touched her voice, too. “Siuan, they
couldn’t have handed me the Hall better if I had told them what to do.”
The last light was failing as Sheriam approached her tiny tent, smaller even than Egwene’s. If
she had not been Keeper, she would have had to share. Ducking inside, she had only time to realize
she was not alone when she was shielded and flung facedown on her cot. Stunned, she tried to cry out,
but a corner of one of her blankets wadded itself into her mouth. Dress and shift burst away from her
body like a pricked bubble.
A hand stroked her head. “You were supposed to keep me informed, Sheriam. That girl is up to
something, and I want to know what.”
It took a long time to convince her questioner that she had already told all she knew, that she
would never hold back a word, not a whisper. When she was left alone at last, it was to lie curled up
and whimpering from her welts, bitterly wishing that she had never in her life spoken to a single sister
in the Hall.

CHAPTER
17

Out on the Ice

T he next morning, a column rode north from the Aes Sedai camp well before dawn, near
silent except for the creak of saddles and the crunch of hooves breaking through the snow’s crisp
crust. Occasionally a horse snorted, or metal jingled and was quickly muffled. The moon was
already down, the sky glistening with stars, but the pale blanket lying over everything below
lightened the darkness. When the first glimmers of day appeared in the east, they had been riding
a good hour or more. Which was not to say they had traveled far. Over some open stretches,
Egwene could let Daishar go at a slow canter that sprayed white like splashing water, but for the
most part, the horses walked, and not quickly, through sparse forest where the snow made deep
drifts below and clung to branches overhead. Oak and pine, sourgum and leatherleaf and trees
she did not recognize all looked even more be draggled than they had in the heat and drought.
Today was the Feast of Abram, but there would be no prizes baked in honeycakes. The Light
send some people found surprises in the day, though.
The sun rose and climbed, a pale golden ball that gave no warmth. Every breath still bit the
throat and produced a puff of mist. A sharp wind blew, not hard, but cutting, and to the west dark
clouds rolled north on their way to Andor. She felt a touch of pity for whoever would know the
burden of those clouds. And relief that they were heading away. Waiting another day would have
been maddening. She had been unable to sleep at all, for fidgety restlessness, not headaches.
Restlessness, and tendrils of fear that had crept in like cold air under the edges of the tent. She was
not tired, though. She felt like a compressed spring, a tight-wound clock, full of energy that wanted
desperately to find release. Light, everything could still go horribly wrong.
It was an impressive column, behind the standard of the White Tower, the white Flame of Tar
Valon centered on a spiral of seven colors, one for each Ajah. Sewn secretly in Salidar, it had lain in
the bottom of a chest ever since, with the keys in the keeping of the Hall. She did not think they would
have produced it except for this morning’s need for pomp. A thousand heavy cavalry in plate-andmail provided a close escort, a panoply of lances, swords, maces and axes seldom seen south of the
Borderlands. Their commander was a one-eyed Shienaran with a vividly painted eyepatch, a man she
had met once, what seemed an Age ago. Uno Nomesta glared at the trees through the steel bars of his
helmet’s faceguard as if he expected every last one to hide an ambush, and his men seemed nearly as

watchful, erect in their saddles.
Almost out of sight ahead through the trees rode a knot of men who wore helmets, breast- and
backplates, but no other armor. Their cloaks whipped about freely; a gauntleted hand for the reins and
a hand for the short bow they each carried left nothing to grasp at warmth. There were more farther
on, and beyond sight to left and right and behind, another thousand altogether, to scout and screen.
Gareth Bryne did not expect trickery from the Andorans, but he had been wrong before, so he said,
and the Murandians were another matter. And then there was the possibility of assassins in Elaida’s
pay, or even Darkfriends. The Light alone knew when a Darkfriend might decide to kill, or why. For
that matter, though the Shaido were supposedly far away, no one ever seemed to know they were
there until the killing began. Even bandits might have tried their hand with too small a party. Lord
Bryne was not a man to take chances unnecessarily, and Egwene was very glad. Today, she wanted as
many witnesses as possible.
She herself rode ahead of the banner, with Sheriam and Siuan and Bryne. The others appeared
caught in their own thoughts. Lord Bryne sat his saddle easily, the mist of his even breath forming a
light frost on his faceguard, yet Egwene could see him calmly marking terrain in his mind. In case he
had to fight over it. Siuan rode so stiffly that she would be sore long before reaching their destination,
but she stared north as though she could already see the lake, and sometimes she nodded to herself, or
shook her head. She would not have done that unless she was uneasy. Sheriam knew no more of what
was to come than the Sitters did, yet she appeared even more nervous than Siuan, shifting constantly
in her saddle and grimacing. Anger shone in her green eyes, too, for some reason.
Close behind the banner came the entire Hall of the Tower in double column, wearing
embroidered silks and rich velvets and furs and cloaks with the Flame large on the back. Women who
seldom wore more ornaments than the Great Serpent ring were decked today in the finest gems the
camp’s jewelry caskets could supply. Their Warders made a more splendid display simply by
wearing their color-shifting cloaks; parts of the men seemed to vanish as the disquieting cloaks
swirled in the stiff breeze. Servants followed, two or three for every sister, on the best horses that
could be found for them. They might have passed for lesser nobility themselves if a number had not
been leading pack animals; every chest in the camp had been ransacked to outfit them in bright colors.
Perhaps because she was one of the Sitters without a Warder, Delana had brought Halima along,
on a spirited white mare. The two rode almost knee-to-knee. Sometimes Delana would lean toward
Halima to speak privately, though Halima appeared too excited to listen. Supposedly, Halima was
Delana’s secretary, but everyone believed it a case of charity, or possibly friendship, however
unlikely, between the dignified, pale-haired sister and the hot-natured, raven-haired country woman.
Egwene had seen Halima’s hand, and it had the unformed look of a child’s just learning her letters.
Today, she was in garments as fine as any sister’s, with gems that easily equaled Delana’s, who must
have been their source. Whenever a gust opened her velvet cloak, she displayed a shocking amount of
bosom, and she always laughed and took her time about gathering it around her again, refusing to
admit that she felt the cold any more than the sisters did.
For once, Egwene was glad of all the gifts of clothing she had been given, allowing her to
surpass the Sitters. Her green-and-blue silk was slashed with white and worked with seed pearls.
Pearls even decorated the backs of her gloves. At the last minute a cloak lined with ermine had been
provided by Romanda, and a necklace and earrings of emeralds and white opals by Lelaine. The
moonstones in her hair came from Janya. The Amyrlin had to be resplendent today. Even Siuan
appeared ready for a ball, in blue velvets and cream lace, with a wide band of pearls at her throat
and more laced through her hair.

Romanda and Lelaine led the Sitters, riding so closely behind the soldier bearing the banner that
he glanced over his shoulder nervously and sometimes edged his horse nearer the riders ahead of him.
Egwene managed not to look back more than once or twice, yet she could feel their eyes pressing
between her shoulder blades. Each thought her tied in a neat bundle, but each had to be wondering
whose cords had done the binding. Oh, Light, this could not go wrong. Not now.
Other than the column, little moved in all that snow-covered landscape. A broad-winged hawk
wheeled overhead against the cold blue sky for a time before winging eastward. Twice Egwene saw
black-tailed foxes trotting in the distance, still in their summer fur, and once, a large deer with tall
forked antlers ghosted away and vanished amid the trees. A hare, starting up right under Bela’s
hooves and bounding off, made the shaggy mare toss her head, and Siuan yelped and grabbed at the
reins as if she expected Bela to bolt. Of course, Bela only gave a reproachful snort and plodded
onward. Egwene’s tall roan gelding shied more, and the hare had not gone near him.
Siuan began grumbling under her breath after the hare scampered away, and it took quite some
time before she eased Bela’s reins. Being on a horse always made her grumpy—she traveled in one
of the wagons whenever possible—but she was seldom this bad. There was no need to look further
than Lord Bryne, or her fierce glances at him, to know why.
If he noticed Siuan’s looks, he gave no sign. The only one not in fine array, he looked as he
always did, plain and slightly battered. A rock that had weathered storms and would outlast more to
come. For some reason, Egwene was glad he had resisted their efforts to dress him in finer garb.
They truly did need to make an impression, yet she thought he made an excellent one as he was.
“It’s a fine morning to be in the saddle,” Sheriam said after a time. “Nothing like a good ride in
the snow to clear the head.” Her voice was not low, and she cut her eyes at the still-muttering Siuan
with a tiny smile.
Siuan did not say anything—she hardly could do that in front of so many eyes—but she did give
Sheriam a hard look that promised sharp words for later. The fire-haired woman twisted away
abruptly with very close to a wince. Wing, her dappled gray mare, pranced a few steps, and Sheriam
settled her down with almost too firm a hand. She had shown little gratitude to the woman who had
named her Mistress of Novices, and like most in that position, she found reasons to blame Siuan. It
was the only flaw Egwene had found in her since the swearing. Well, she had protested that, as
Keeper, she should not have to take orders from Siuan the way the others who had sworn did, but
Egwene had seen right away where that would lead. This was not the first time Sheriam had tried to
plant a barb. Siuan insisted on handling Sheriam herself, and her pride was too fragile for Egwene to
deny the request unless matters got out of hand.
Egwene wished there were some way to make more speed. Siuan went back to her grumbling,
and Sheriam was obviously thinking of something else to say that would not quite bring a rebuke. All
that muttering and cutting of eyes began to find their way under Egwene’s skin. After a while, even
Bryne’s levelheaded poise began to wear. She found herself thinking of things she might say that
would shake his aplomb. Unfortunately—or perhaps fortunately—she did not believe anything could.
But if she had to wait much longer, she thought she might burst from sheer impatience.
The sun climbed toward midday, the painfully slow miles passed behind, and at last one of the
riders ahead turned and raised his hand. With a hasty apology to Egwene, Bryne galloped forward. It
was really more of a lumber through the snow for his sturdy bay gelding, Traveler, but he caught up to
the outriders, exchanged a few words, then sent them on through the trees and waited for Egwene and
the others to reach him.
As he fell in beside her once more, Romanda and Lelaine joined them. The two Sitters barely

acknowledged Egwene’s presence, fixing Bryne with the cool serenity that had shaken so many men
facing Aes Sedai. Except that now and then, each glanced sideways at the other in a considering way.
They hardly seemed to realize what they were doing. Egwene hoped they were half as nervous as she;
she would be satisfied with that.
Coolly serene stares washed over Bryne like rain over that rock. He made slight bows to the
Sitters, but he spoke to Egwene. “They’ve already arrived, Mother.” That had been expected. “They
brought almost as many men as we did, but they’re all on the north side of the lake. I’ve put scouts out
to make sure nobody tries circling around, but in truth, I don’t expect it.”
“Let us hope you’re right,” Romanda told him sharply, and Lelaine added in a much colder tone,
“Your judgment has not been all it should be, of late, Lord Bryne.” A frigid, cutting tone.
“As you say, Aes Sedai.” He made another slight bow without really turning from Egwene. Like
Siuan, he was tied to her openly now, at least so far as the Hall was concerned. If only they did not
know how tightly. If only she could be sure how tightly. “One thing more, Mother,” he went on.
“Talmanes is there at the lake, too. There are about a hundred of the Band on the east side. Not
enough to cause trouble even if he wanted to, and small chance he would, I think.”
Egwene merely nodded. Not enough to cause trouble? Talmanes alone might be enough! She
tasted bile. It—could—not—go—wrong—now!
“Talmanes!” Lelaine exclaimed, serenity shattering. She must have been as much on edge as
Egwene. “How did he find out? If you’ve included Dragonsworn in your scheming, Lord Bryne, you
truly will learn what going too far means!”
Right on top of her, Romanda growled, “This is disgraceful! You say you’ve only learned of his
presence now? If that’s so, your reputation is puffed up like a boil!” Aes Sedai calm was a thin layer
for some today, it seemed.
They continued in that vein, but Bryne rode on, only murmuring the occasional “As you say, Aes
Sedai,” when he had to say something. He had received worse in Egwene’s hearing this morning, and
reacted no more. It was Siuan who finally snorted, and then blushed crimson when the Sitters looked
at her in surprise. Egwene almost shook her head. Siuan was very definitely in love. And she very
definitely needed talking to! For some reason, Bryne smiled, but that might just have been because he
was no longer the object of the Sitters’ attention.
Trees gave way to another open space, larger than most, and there was no more time for
frivolous thoughts.
Aside from a wide rim of tall brown reeds and cattails poking through the snow, nothing named
this a lake. It could have been a big meadow, flat and very roughly oval in shape. Some distance from
the treeline, on the frozen lake, stood a large blue canopy on tall poles, with a small crowd of people
milling about it and dozens of horses held by servants behind. The breeze ruffled a bright thicket of
pennants and banners, and carried muffled shouts that could only have been orders. More servants
darted about hastily. Apparently, they had not been there long enough to finish their preparations.
Perhaps a mile away the trees began again, and the feeble sunlight glinted off metal there. Quite
a lot of metal, stretching the length of the far shore. To the east, almost as close as the pavilion, the
hundred men of the Band made no effort at concealment, standing beside their mounts just short of
where the cattails began. A few of them pointed when the flag of Tar Valon appeared. The people at
the pavilion stopped to look.
Egwene did not pause before riding out onto the snow-covered ice. She did imagine herself a
rosebud opening to the sun, though, that old novice exercise. She did not actually embrace saidar, but
the calm that came was very welcome.

Siuan and Sheriam followed, and the Sitters with their Warders, and the servants. Lord Bryne
and the banner-man were the only two soldiers who went. Shouts rising behind her told of Uno putting
his armored horsemen into position along the shoreline. The more lightly armored men were arrayed
to either side, those not off guarding against treachery. One reason the lake had been chosen was that
the ice was thick enough to hold a fair number of horses, but not hundreds, much less thousands. That
cut down on the chance of chicanery. Of course, a pavilion beyond bowshot was not beyond the range
of the One Power, not if it could be seen. Except that the worst man in the world knew himself safe
from that unless he threatened a sister. Egwene exhaled sharply, and began acquiring calm all over
again.
A proper greeting for the Amyrlin Seat should have had servants rushing forward with warm
drinks and cloths wrapped around hot bricks, and the lords and ladies themselves to take reins and
offer a kiss in token of Abram. Any visitor of rank at all would have had the servants, but no one
stirred from the pavilion. Bryne himself dismounted and came to hold Daishar’s bridle, and the same
lanky young man who had come with fresh charcoal the day before ran to hold Egwene’s stirrup. His
nose still dripped, but in a red velvet coat only a little too large for him and a bright blue cloak, he
outshone any of the nobles who stood staring from under the canopy. They appeared to be in stout
woolens for the most part, with not much embroidery and very little silk or lace. Likely they had had
to scramble to find suitable clothes once the snows began, and them already on the march. Though the
simple truth was that the young man might have outshone a Tinker.
Carpets had been laid to floor the pavilion, and braziers lit, though the breeze carried away heat
and smoke alike. Chairs stood in two facing lines for the delegations, eight in each. They had not
expected so many sisters. Some of the waiting nobles exchanged looks of consternation, and a number
of their servants actually wrung their hands, wondering what to do. They need not have.
The chairs were a mismatched miscellany, but they were all alike in size, and none was
noticeably more worn or battered than another. None had noticeably more or less gilded carving. The
lanky young man and a number of others trotted in and under the frowns of the nobles, without so
much as a by-your-leave, carried those meant for Aes Sedai out into the snow, then rushed to help
with unloading the packhorses. Still, no one spoke a word.
Quickly, seats were set up sufficient for the entire Hall, and Egwene. Only simple benches,
though polished till they gleamed, but each stood on a wide box covered with cloth in the color of the
Sitter’s Ajah, in a long row as wide as the canopy. The box placed in front, for Egwene’s bench, was
striped like her stole. There had been a great flurry of activity in the night, beginning with finding
beeswax for polish and good cloth of the right colors.
When Egwene and the Sitters took their places, they sat a foot higher than anyone else. She had
had her doubts about that, but the lack of any word of welcome had settled those. The meanest farmer
would have offered a cup and a kiss to a vagabond on the Feast of Abram. They were not supplicants,
and they were not equals. They were Aes Sedai.
Warders stood behind their Aes Sedai, and Siuan and Sheriam flanked Egwene. The sisters
ostentatiously flung back cloaks and tucked gloves away to emphasize that the cold did not touch
them, a sharp contrast to the nobles clutching their own cloaks close. Outside, the Flame of Tar Valon
lifted in the stiffening breeze. Only Halima, lounging beside Delana’s chair on the edge of the graycovered box, at all spoiled the grand image, and her big green eyes stared at the Andorans and
Murandians so challengingly that she did not spoil it much.
There were a few stares when Egwene took the seat in front, but only a few. No one really
looked surprised. I suppose they’ve heard all about the girl Amyrlin, she thought dryly. Well, there

had been queens younger, including queens of Andor and Murandy. Calmly, she nodded, and Sheriam
gestured to the line of chairs. No matter who had arrived first or provided the pavilion, there was no
doubt who had called this meeting. Who was in charge.
Her action was not well received, of course. There was a moment of silent hesitation while the
nobles cast their minds about for some way to regain an equal footing, and no few grimaces as they
realized it could not be done. Grim-faced, eight of them sat down, four men and four women, with
much angry gathering of cloaks and adjusting of skirts. Those of lesser rank stood behind the chairs,
and clearly there was little love lost between Andoran and Murandian. For that matter, the
Murandians, men and women alike, muttered and jostled one another for precedence as fiercely as
they did their “allies” from the north. The Aes Sedai received a good many dark looks as well, and a
few folk spared scowls for Bryne, who stood off to one side with his helmet under his arm. He was
well known on both sides of the border, and respected even by most of those who would have liked
to see him dead. At least, that had been the case before he turned up leading the Aes Sedai’s army. He
ignored their acid glares as he had the Sitters’ acid tongues.
Another man did not join with either party. A pale man, less than a hand taller than Egwene, in a
dark coat and breastplate, he wore the front of his head shaved, and there was a long red scarf tied
around his left arm. His deep gray cloak had a large red hand worked on the breast. Talmanes stood
opposite Bryne, leaning against one of the pavilion’s poles with an arrogant casualness, and watched
without revealing a hint of his thoughts. Egwene wished she knew what he was doing there. She
wished she knew what he had said before she arrived. In any case, she had to speak with him. If it
could be managed without a hundred ears listening.
A lean, weathered man in a red cloak, sitting in the middle of the row of chairs, leaned forward
and opened his mouth, but Sheriam forestalled him in a clear, carrying voice.
“Mother, may I present to you, of Andor, Arathelle Renshar, High Seat of House Renshar.
Pelivar Coelan, High Seat of House Coelan. Aemlyn Carand, High Seat of House Carand, and her
husband, Culhan Carand.” They acknowledged their names sourly, with bare nods and no more.
Pelivar was the lean man; he was losing his dark hair from the front. Sheriam went on without pause;
it was a good thing Bryne had been able to supply the names of those who had been chosen to speak.
“May I present, of Murandy, Donel do Morny a’Lordeine. Cian do Mehon a’Macansa. Paitr do
Fearna a’Conn. Segan do Avharin a’Roos.” The Murandians seemed to feel the lack of titles even
more than the Andorans. Donel, wearing more lace than most of the women, twisted his curled
mustaches fiercely, and Paitr appeared to be trying to yank his loose. Segan pursed full lips and her
dark eyes caught fire, while Cian, a stocky, graying woman, snorted quite loudly. Sheriam took no
notice. “You are beneath the eyes of the Watcher of the Seals. You are before the Flame of Tar Valon.
You may present your supplications to the Amyrlin Seat.”
Well. They did not like that, not in the least. Egwene had thought them sour before, but now they
looked stuffed full of green persimmons. Perhaps they had believed they could pretend she was not
the Amyrlin at all. They would learn. Of course, first she had to teach the Hall.
“There are ancient ties between Andor and the White Tower,” she said, loudly and firmly.
“Sisters have always expected welcome in Andor or Murandy. Why then do you bring an army
against Aes Sedai? You meddle where thrones and nations fear to step. Thrones have fallen, meddling
in the affairs of Aes Sedai.”
That sounded suitably threatening, whether or not Myrelle and the others had managed to prepare
her way. With luck, they were well on their way back to the camp, with no one the wiser. Unless one
of these nobles spoke the wrong name. That would lose her an advantage against the Hall, but

alongside everything else, it was a straw beside a hayloft.
Pelivar exchanged looks with the woman seated beside him, and she stood. Creases in her face
could not disguise the fact that Arathelle had been a beautiful, fine-boned woman when young; now,
gray threaded thickly through her hair, and her gaze struck as hard as any Warder’s. Her red-gloved
hands gripped the edges of her cloak at her sides, but plainly not in worry. Mouth compressed to a
thin line, she scanned the line of Sitters, and only then spoke. Past Egwene, to the sisters behind her.
Gritting her teeth, Egwene put on an attentive expression.
“We are here precisely because we do not want to become entangled in the White Tower’s
affairs.” Arathelle’s voice held tones of authority, unsurprising in the High Seat of a powerful House.
There was no hint of the diffidence that might have been expected, even from a powerful High Seat,
facing so many sisters, not to mention the Amyrlin Seat. “If all we’ve heard is true, then at best,
allowing you to pass through Andor unhindered may seem like giving aid, or even alliance, in the
eyes of the White Tower. Failure to oppose you might mean learning what the grape learns in the
winepress.” Several of the Murandians turned their scowls on her. No one in Murandy had tried to
hinder the sisters’ passage. Very likely, no one had considered the possibilities beyond the day they
passed onto another’s lands.
Arathelle continued as if she had not noticed, but Egwene doubted that. “At worst. . . . We have
heard . . . reports . . . of Aes Sedai making their way into Andor in secret, and Tower Guards. Rumors
might be a better word, but they come from many places. None of us would like to see a battle
between Aes Sedai in Andor.”
“The Light preserve and protect us!” Donel burst out, red-faced. Paitr nodded encouragement,
sliding to the edge of his seat, and Cian looked ready to jump in herself. “No one wants to see it here,
either!” Donel spat. “Not between Aes Sedai! For sure, we’ve heard what happened out east! And
those sisters—!”
Egwene breathed a little more easily when Arathelle stepped on him firmly. “If you please, Lord
Donel. You will have your turn to speak.” She turned back to Egwene—to the Sitters once more,
really—without waiting on his reply, leaving him spluttering and the other three Murandians
glowering. She herself looked quite undisturbed, simply a woman laying out the facts. Laying them
out, and meaning that they should be seen as she saw them.
“As I was saying. That is the worst we fear, if the tales are true. And also if they are not. Aes
Sedai may be gathering secretly in Andor, with Tower Guards. Aes Sedai with an army are ready to
enter Andor. Often enough the White Tower has seemed to aim at one target, only for the rest of us to
learn later it was aiming at another all along. I can hardly imagine even the White Tower going this
far, but if ever there was a target you might twist yourselves into a knot for, it’s the Black Tower.”
Arathelle shivered slightly, and Egwene did not think it was the cold. “A battle between Aes Sedai
might ruin the land for miles around. That battle might ruin half of Andor.”
Pelivar sprang to his feet. “The plain of it is, you must go another way.” His voice was
surprisingly high, but no less firm than Arathelle’s. “If I must die to defend my lands and my people,
then better here than where my lands and people die, too.”
He subsided at Arathelle’s soothing gesture, sinking back into his chair. Hard-eyed, he did not
look mollified. Aemlyn, a plump woman wrapped in dark wool, nodded agreement with him, as did
her square-faced husband.
Donel stared at Pelivar as though he had never had this thought either, and he was not the only
one. Some of the standing Murandians began to argue out loud until others quieted them. Sometimes
with a shaken fist. Whatever had possessed these people to join forces with the Andorans?

Egwene drew breath. A rosebud, opening to the sun. They had not acknowledged her as the
Amyrlin Seat—Arathelle had come as close to ignoring her as was possible without pushing her
aside!—yet they had given her everything else she could have wished for. Calm. Now was when
Lelaine and Romanda would be expecting her to name one of them to handle the negotiations. She
hoped their stomachs were tied in knots with wondering which of them it would be. There would be
no negotiations. There could be none.
“Elaida,” she said levelly, eyeing Arathelle and the seated nobles in turn, “is a usurper who has
violated what lies at the very heart of the White Tower. I am the Amyrlin Seat.” She was surprised at
how stately she managed to sound, how cool. But not as surprised as she once would have been. The
Light help her, she was the Amyrlin Seat. “We go to Tar Valon to remove Elaida and try her, but that
is the White Tower’s business, and none of yours except to know the truth. This so-called Black
Tower also is our business; men who can channel have always been the White Tower’s affair. We
will deal with them as we choose, when the time is ripe, but I assure you, that time is not now. More
important matters must take precedence.”
She heard movement among the Sitters behind her. An actual shifting on benches and the crisp
swishing of divided skirts being adjusted. At least some must be severely agitated. Well, several had
suggested that the Black Tower might be dealt with in passing. Not one believed there could be more
than a dozen or so men there at most, no matter what they heard; after all, it simply was not possible
that hundreds of men would want to channel. Then again, it might have been the realization that
Egwene was not going to name either Romanda or Lelaine.
Arathelle frowned, perhaps catching a hint of something in the air. Pelivar moved, on the point
of rising again, and Donel drew himself up querulously. There was nothing for it but to press on.
There never had been.
“I understand your concerns,” she continued in the same formal tone, “and I will address them.”
What was that strange call to arms the Band used? Yes. It was time to toss the dice. “I give you this
assurance as the Amyrlin Seat. For one month we will stay here, resting, and then we will leave
Murandy, but we will not cross the border into Andor. Murandy will be troubled by us no more after
that, and Andor will not be troubled at all. I’m certain,” she added, “the Murandian lords and ladies
here will be happy to supply our wants in exchange for good silver. We will pay fair prices.” There
was no point mollifying the Andorans if it meant Murandians raiding the horses and supply trains.
The Murandians, looking around uneasily, appeared decidedly torn in any case. There was coin
to be made, and a great deal of it supplying an army so large, but on the other hand, who could haggle
successfully with whatever an army so large offered? Donel actually seemed ready to sick up, while
Cian seemed to be doing sums in her head. Mutters rose among the onlookers. More than mutters;
nearly loud enough for Egwene.
She wanted to look over her shoulder. The silence from the Sitters was deafening. Siuan was
staring straight ahead and gripping her skirts as if to keep herself looking forward by main force. At
least she had known what was coming. Sheriam, who had not, eyed the Andorans and Murandians
regally, calmly, as though she had expected every word.
Egwene needed to make them forget the girl they saw before them, and hear a woman with the
reins of power firmly in hand. If they were not in her hands now, they would be! She firmed her
voice. “Mark me well. I have made my decision; it is for you to accept it. Or face what surely will
come from your failure.” As she fell silent, the wind gusted to a brief howl, rattling the canopy,
tugging at garments. Egwene straightened her hair calmly. Some of the watching nobles shivered and
twitched their cloaks around them, and she hoped their shivers came from more than the weather.

Arathelle exchanged looks with Pelivar and Aemlyn, and all three studied the Sitters before
slowly nodding. They believed she was merely mouthing words the Sitters had put on her tongue!
Even so, Egwene very nearly sighed with relief.
“It will be as you say,” the hard-eyed noblewoman said. Again, to the Sitters. “We do not doubt
the word of Aes Sedai, of course, but you will understand if we also remain. Sometimes, what you
hear isn’t what you think you heard. Not that that’s the case here, I’m sure. But we will stay while you
do.” Donel truly looked ready to empty himself. Very likely his lands lay nearby. Andoran armies in
Murandy had seldom been known to pay for anything.
Egwene stood, and she could hear the rustle of the Sitters rising behind her. “It is agreed, then.
We must all depart soon, if we are to return to our own beds before dark, but we should spare a few
moments. Getting to know one another a little better now might avoid misunderstandings later.” And
talk might give her a chance to reach Talmanes. “Oh. One other thing you should all be aware of. The
novice book is now open to any woman, whatever her age, if she tests true.” Arathelle blinked. Siuan
did not, yet Egwene thought she heard a faint grunt. This was not part of what they had discussed, but
there would never be a better time. “Come. I’m sure you would all like to speak with the Sitters. Let
formality go.”
Without waiting for Sheriam to offer a hand, she stepped down. She almost felt like laughing.
Last night she had been afraid she might never reach her goal, but she was halfway there, almost
halfway, and it had not been nearly as difficult as she had feared. Of course, the other half remained.

CHAPTER
18

A Peculiar Calling

F

or a moment after Egwene descended, no one else moved. And then the Andorans and
Murandians headed for the Sitters, almost as one. Apparently, a girl Amyrlin—a girl puppet and
figurehead!—held no interest, not with ageless faces in front of them that at least said they
actually were speaking to Aes Sedai. Two or three lords and ladies clustered around each Sitter,
some thrusting their chins demandingly, others diffidently bending their necks, yet every one
insistent on being heard. The sharp breeze whisked away the mist of their breath and fluttered
cloaks forgotten in the importance of asking their questions. Sheriam was buttonholed too, by
red-faced Lord Donel, who blustered and jerked bows by turns.
Egwene pulled Sheriam away from the narrow-eyed man. “Find out discreetly all you can about
these sisters and Tower Guards in Andor,” she whispered hastily. As soon as she released the
woman, Donel reclaimed her. Sheriam actually looked put-upon, but her frown disappeared quickly.
Donel blinked uneasily as she began questioning him.
Romanda and Lelaine gazed at Egwene through the crowd with faces carved from ice, but each
had acquired a pair of nobles who wanted. . . . Something. Reassurance that there was no hidden trick
in Egwene’s words, perhaps. How they would hate doing that, but dodge and duck as they would—
and they would!—there was no way to really avoid that reassurance without repudiating her on the
spot. Even those two would not go that far. Not here, not publicly.
Siuan slipped close to Egwene, features set in meekness. Except that her eyes darted, maybe
looking for Romanda or Lelaine coming to seize them where they stood, and forget law, custom,
propriety and who was watching. “Shein Chunla,” she all but hissed in a whisper.
Egwene nodded, but her eyes searched for Talmanes. Most of the men and some of the women
were tall enough to hide him. With everyone shifting about. . . . She went up on her toes. Where had
he gone to?
Segan planted herself in front of her, fists on her hips, eyeing Siuan doubtfully. Egwene let her
heels down hurriedly. The Amyrlin could not bob about like a girl at a dance looking for a boy. A
rosebud unfolding. Calm. Serenity. Drat all men!
A slender woman with long dark hair, Segan seemed to have been born petulant, her full mouth
fixed in a pout. Her dress was good blue wool and made for warmth, but it had far too much vivid

green embroidery across her bosom, and her gloves were bright enough for a Tinker. She looked
Egwene up and down, pursing her lips, with as much incredulity on her face as she had given Siuan.
“What you said about the novice book,” she said abruptly. “Were you meaning any woman of any age
at all? Any can become Aes Sedai, then?”
A question close to Egwene’s heart, and an answer she dearly wanted to give—along with a box
on the ear for the doubt—but just then a small gap in the flow of people showed her Talmanes near
the back of the pavilion. Talking with Pelivar! They stood stiffly, mastiffs not quite ready to show
teeth, yet they were keeping a watch to make sure no one came close enough to overhear what they
had to say. “Any woman of any age at all, daughter,” she agreed absently. Pelivar?
“Thank you,” Segan said, and haltingly added, “Mother.” She sketched a curtsy, the barest hint of
one, before hurrying off. Egwene stared after her. Well, it was a beginning.
Siuan snorted. “I don’t mind sailing the Fingers of the Dragon in the dark if I must,” she muttered
half under her breath. “We discussed that; we weighed the dangers, and anyway, there doesn’t seem
to be a gull’s last dinner for choice. But you have to set a fire on deck just to make things interesting.
Netting lion-fish isn’t enough for you. You have to stuff a prickleback down your dress, too. You
aren’t content trying to wade a school of silverpike—”
Egwene broke in. “Siuan, I think I should tell Lord Bryne you’re head over heels in love with
him. It’s only fair that he know, don’t you agree?” Siuan’s blue eyes bulged, and her mouth worked,
but all that came out was a sort of gobbling. Egwene patted her shoulder. “You’re Aes Sedai, Siuan.
Try to maintain at least a little dignity. And try to find out about those sisters in Andor.” The crowd
parted again. She saw Talmanes in a different place, but still on the edge of the pavilion. And alone,
now.
Trying not to hurry, she walked in his direction, leaving Siuan still gobbling. A pretty, blackhaired serving man, whose bulky woolen breeches could not quite hide neatly turned calves, offered
Siuan a steaming silver cup from a tray. Other servants were moving about with other silver trays.
Refreshment was being offered, if a bit late. It was much too late for the kiss of peace. She did not
hear what Siuan said as she snatched a cup, but from the way the fellow jerked and started bobbing
bows, he had received sharp shards of her temper at the least. Egwene sighed.
Talmanes stood with arms folded, observing the goings-on with an amused smile that did not
reach his eyes. He seemed poised to explode into motion, but his eyes were tired. At her approach, he
made a respectful leg, but there was a wry touch to his voice when he said, “You changed a border
today.” He gathered his cloak against the icy breeze. “It has always been . . . fluid . . . between Andor
and Murandy, no matter what maps say, but Andor has never come south in such numbers before.
Except for the Aiel War, and the Whitecloak War, anyway, but they were only passing through, then.
Once they have been here a month, new maps will show a new line. Look at the Murandians
scramble, fawning over Pelivar and his companions as much as they do the sisters. They are hoping to
make new friends for the new day.”
To Egwene, trying to conceal her careful watch on those who might be watching her, it seemed
that all of the nobles, Murandian and Andoran, were intent on the Sitters, crowding around them. In
any case, she had slightly more important matters in mind than borders. To her, if not to the nobles.
Except for brief moments, none of the Sitters were visible beyond the tops of their heads. Only
Halima and Siuan seemed to notice her, and a babble like that of a flock of excited geese filled the
air. She lowered her voice, and chose her words carefully.
“Friends are always important, Talmanes. You’ve been a good friend to Mat, and I think to me. I
hope that hasn’t changed. I hope you’ve not told anyone what you shouldn’t.” Light, she was anxious,

or she would not have been so direct. Next, she would come right out and ask what he and Pelivar
had been talking about!
Luckily, he did not laugh at her for a blunt-tongued village woman. Though he might have been
thinking it. He studied her seriously before speaking. In a soft voice. He also knew caution. “Not all
men gossip. Tell me, when you sent Mat south, did you know what you would do here today?”
“How could I know that two months ago? No, Aes Sedai aren’t omniscient, Talmanes.” She had
hoped for something that would put her in the place she was, had planned for it, but she had not
known, not back then. She also hoped he did not gossip. Some men did not.
Romanda started toward her with a firm stride and a frozen face, but Arathelle intercepted her,
catching the Yellow Sitter’s arm and refusing to be put off despite Romanda’s astonishment.
“Will you at least tell me where Mat is?” Talmanes asked. “On his way to Caemlyn with the
Daughter-Heir? Why are you surprised? A serving woman will speak to a soldier when fetching
water from the same stream. Even when he is a horrible Dragonsworn,” he added dryly.
Light! Men really were . . . inconvenient . . . at times. The best of them found ways to say exactly
the wrong thing at the wrong moment, to ask the wrong question. Not to mention inveigling serving
women into prattle. So much easier if she could just lie, but he had given her plenty of room within
the Oaths. Half the truth would suffice, and keep him from haring off to Ebou Dar. Maybe less than
half.
Over in the far corner of the pavilion, Siuan stood conversing with a tall young redhead with
curled mustaches who was eyeing her as dubiously as Segan had. Nobles usually knew the look of
Aes Sedai. But he held only a part of Siuan’s attention. Her gaze constantly flickered toward Egwene.
It seemed to shout, loud as conscience. Easier. Expedient. What it was to be Aes Sedai. She hadnot
known about today, only hoped! Egwene expelled an irritated breath. Burn the woman!
“He was in Ebou Dar, the last I heard,” she muttered. “But he must be hurrying north as fast as he
can by now. He still thinks he has to save me, Talmanes, and Matrim Cauthon wouldn’t miss the
chance to be on the spot so he can say I told you so.”
Talmanes did not look at all surprised. “I thought it might be so,” he sighed. “I have . . . felt . . .
something, for weeks now. Others in the Band have, too. Not urgent, but always there. As if he needed
me. As if I should look south, anyway. It can be peculiar, following a ta’veren.”
“I suppose it can,” she agreed, hoping none of her incredulity showed. It was strange enough to
think of Mat the wastrel as leader of the Band of the Red Hand, much less as ta’veren, but surely a
ta’veren had to be present, nearby at least, to have any effect.
“Mat was wrong about you needing rescue. You never had any intention of coming to me for
help, did you?”
He still spoke softly, but she looked around hurriedly anyway. Siuan was still watching them.
And so was Halima. Paitr stood much too close to her, puffing and preening and stroking his
mustaches—from the way he stared down her dress, he had not mistaken her for a sister, that was
certain!—but she was giving him only half her mind, darting sidelong glances in Egwene’s direction
while she smiled up at him warmly. Everyone else appeared occupied, and no one stood close enough
to hear.
“The Amyrlin Seat could hardly go running for sanctuary, now could she? But there have been
times it’s been a comfort knowing you were there,” she admitted. Reluctantly. The Amyrlin Seat was
hardly supposed to need a bolt-hole, but it could do no harm so long as none of the Sitters knew.
“You have been a friend, Talmanes. I hope that continues. I truly do.”
“You have been more . . . open . . . with me than I expected,” he said slowly, “so I will tell you

something.” His face did not change—to any watcher, he must have seemed as casual as before—but
his voice dropped to a whisper. “I have had approaches from King Roedran about the Band. It seems
he has hopes of being Murandy’s first real king. He wants to hire us. I would not have considered it,
normally, but there is never enough coin, and with this . . . this feel of Mat needing us. . . . It might be
better if we remain in Murandy. Clear as good glass, you are where you want to be and have
everything in hand.”
He fell silent as a young serving woman curtsied to offer mulled wine. She wore finely
embroidered green wool and a cloak plush with spotted rabbit. Other servants from the camp were
helping out now, as well, no doubt for something to do besides stand and shiver. The young woman’s
round face was decidedly pinched from the cold.
Talmanes waved her off and pulled his cloak back around him, but Egwene took a silver cup to
gain a moment for thought. Truly there was little need for the Band any longer. Despite all the
muttering, the sisters took their presence as a matter of course now, Dragon-sworn or not; they no
longer feared an attack, and there had been no real need to use the Band’s presence to prod them into
moving since leaving Salidar. The only true purpose Shen an Calhar served now was to draw
recruits into Bryne’s army, men who thought two armies meant a battle and wanted to be on the side
with the greatest numbers. She had no need of them, but Talmanes had acted as a friend. And she was
Amyrlin. Sometimes friendship and responsibility pushed in the same direction.
As the serving woman moved off, Egwene laid a hand on Talmanes’ arm. “You must not do that.
Even the Band can’t conquer all of Murandy by itself, and every hand will be against you. You know
very well the one thing that makes Murandians stand together is foreigners on their soil. Follow us to
Tar Valon, Talmanes. Mat will come there; I have no doubt of that.” Mat would not really believe she
was the Amyrlin until he saw her wearing the stole in the White Tower.
“Roedran is no fool,” he said placidly. “All he wants us to do is sit and wait, a foreign army—
without Aes Sedai—and nobody knowing what it is up to. He should not have much trouble uniting
the nobles against us. Then, so he says, we quietly slip across the border. He thinks he can hold on to
them afterward.”
She could not stop a touch of heat entering her voice. “And what is to stop him betraying you? If
the threat goes away without a fight, his dream of a united Murandy might, too.” The fool man seemed
amused!
“I am not a fool either. Roedran cannot be ready before spring. This lot would never have stirred
from their manors if the Andorans had not come south, and they were on the march before the snows
began. Before then, Mat will find us. If he is coming north, he must hear of us. Roedran will have to
be satisfied with whatever he has managed by then. So if Mat does intend to go to Tar Valon, I may
see you there yet.”
Egwene made a vexed sound. It was a remarkable plan, the sort of thing Siuan might devise, and
hardly a scheme she thought Roedran Almaric do Arreloa a’Naloy could carry off. The fellow was
said to be so dissolute he made Mat look wholesome. But then, it was hardly a scheme she would
have believed Roedran could think up. The only certainty was that Talmanes had made up his mind.
“I want your word, Talmanes, that you won’t let Roedran pull you into a war.” Responsibility.
The narrow stole around her neck seemed to weigh ten times more than her cloak. “If he moves
sooner than you think, you will leave whether or not Mat has joined you.”
“I wish I could promise, but it is not possible,” he protested. “I expect the first raid against my
foragers three days at most after I start moving away from Lord Bryne’s army. Every lordling and
farmer will think he can pick up a few horses in the night, give me a pinprick, and run off to hide.”

“I’m not talking about defending yourself, and you know it,” she said firmly. “Your word,
Talmanes. Or I will not allow your agreement with Roedran.” The only way to stop it was to betray
it, but she would not leave a war in her wake, a war she had started by bringing Talmanes here.
Staring at her as if for the first time, he finally bent his head. Strangely, that seemed more formal
than his bow had. “It will be as you say, Mother. Tell me, are you sure you are not ta’veren, too?”
“I am the Amyrlin Seat,” she replied. “That is quite enough for anyone.” She touched his arm
again. “The Light shine on you, Talmanes.” His smile nearly touched his eyes this time.
Inevitably, despite their whispers, their talk had been noticed. Maybe because of their whispers.
The girl who claimed to be Amyrlin, a rebel against the White Tower, in conversation with the leader
of ten thousand Dragonsworn. Had she made Talmanes’ scheme with Roedran harder, or easier? Was
war in Murandy less likely, or more? Siuan and her bloody Law of Unintended Consequences! Fifty
gazes followed her, then darted away, as she moved through the crowd warming her fingers on her
cup. Well, most darted away. The Sitters’ faces were all ageless Aes Sedai serenity, but Lelaine
might have been a brown-eyed crow watching a fish struggle in the shallows, while Romanda’s
slightly darker eyes could have drilled holes through iron.
Trying to keep a watch on the sun outside, she made a slow circuit through the pavilion. The
nobles were still importuning Sitters, but they moved from one to another as if seeking better answers,
and she began to notice small things. Donel paused on his way from Janya to Moria, bowing low to
Aemlyn, who acknowledged him with a gracious nod. Cian, turning away from Takima, curtsied
deeply to Pelivar and received a slight bow in return. There were others, always a Murandian
deferring to an Andoran who responded just as formally. The Andorans tried to ignore Bryne except
for the odd scowl, but any number of Murandians sought him out, one by one and well away from
everyone else, and from the directions their eyes went, it was plain they were discussing Pelivar, or
Arathelle, or Aemlyn. Perhaps Talmanes had been right.
She received bows and curtsies, too, though none so deep as those given Arathelle and Pelivar
and Aemlyn, much less the Sitters. Half a dozen women told her how thankful they were that matters
had been resolved peacefully, though in truth, almost as many made noncommittal noises or shrugged
uneasily when she expressed the same sentiment, as though they were uncertain it all would end
peacefully. Her assurances that it would were met with a fervent “The Light send it so!” or a resigned
“If the Light wills.” Four called her Mother, one without hesitating first. Three others said that she
was quite lovely, that she had beautiful eyes, and that she had a graceful carriage, in that order;
suitable compliments perhaps for Egwene’s age but not her station.
At least she found one unalloyed pleasure. Segan was not alone in being intrigued by her
announcement concerning the novice book. Plainly that was why most of the women spoke to her in
the first place. After all, the other sisters might be in rebellion against the Tower, but she claimed to
be the Amyrlin Seat. Their interest had to be strong to overcome that, though no one wanted to let it
show. Arathelle made the inquiry with a frown that put more creases in her cheeks. Aemlyn shook her
graying head at the answer. Blocky Cian asked, followed by a sharp-faced Andoran lady named
Negara, then a pretty, big-eyed Murandian called Jennet, and others. None wanted to know for herself
—several made that clear quickly, especially the younger women—but before long, every single
noblewoman there had asked, and several servants as well, under cover of offering more spiced
wine. One, a wiry woman named Nildra, had come from the Aes Sedai camp.
Egwene felt quite pleased with the seed she had planted there. She was not so pleased with the
men. A few spoke to her, but only when they came face-to-face and seemed to have no other choice.
A murmured word about the weather, either praising the end of the drought or deploring the sudden

snows, a muttered hope that the bandit problem would end soon, perhaps with a significant look
toward Talmanes, and they slipped away like greased pigs. A bear of an Andoran by the name of
Macharan tripped over his own boots to avoid her. In a way, it was hardly surprising. The women
had the justification, if only to themselves, of the novice book, but the men had only the thought that
being seen conversing with her might tar them with the same brush.
It was really quite discouraging. She did not care what the men thought about novices, but she
very much wanted to know if they were as fearful as the women that this would come to blows in the
end. Fears like that could fulfill themselves very easily. At last, she decided there was only one way
to find out.
Pelivar turned from taking a fresh cup of wine from a tray and started back, with a muffled oath,
to keep from bumping into her; had she stood any closer, she would have had to stand on his boots.
Hot wine splashed over his gloved hand and ran down under his coatsleeve, producing a curse not so
muted. Tall enough to loom over her, he made a good job of it. His scowl belonged on a man wanting
to send an annoying young woman briskly out of his way. Or on a man who had nearly stepped on a
red adder. She held herself erect and focused on an image of him as a small boy up to no good; that
always helped; most men seemed to feel it. He muttered something—it might have been a polite
greeting, or another oath—and dipped his head slightly, then tried to step around her. She sidestepped to stay in front of him. He moved back, and she followed. He began to look hunted. She
decided to try putting him at ease before pressing the important question. She wanted answers, not
more mumbling.
“You must be pleased to hear that the Daughter-Heir is on her way to Caemlyn, Lord Pelivar.”
She had heard several of the Sitters mention that.
His face went blank. “Elayne Trakand has a right to put in her claim to the Lion Throne,” he
replied in a flat voice.
Egwene’s eyes widened, and he stepped back again, uncertainly. Perhaps he thought her angry
over the absence of her title, but she barely noticed that. Pelivar had supported Elayne’s mother in her
claim for the throne, and Elayne had been sure he would support her, too. She spoke of Pelivar
fondly, like a favorite uncle.
“Mother,” Siuan murmured at her elbow, “we must leave if you want to be sure of reaching the
camp before sunset.” She managed to put considerable urgency into those quiet words. The sun had
passed its peak.
“This is no weather to be in the open at nightfall,” Pelivar said hurriedly. “If you will excuse
me, I must make ready to leave.” Shoving his cup onto the tray of a passing servant, he hesitated
before halfway making a leg, and stalked off with the air of a man who had wriggled free of a trap.
Egwene wanted to grind her teeth with frustration. What did the men think of their agreement? If
it could be called that, the way she had forced it on them. Arathelle and Aemlyn had more power and
influence than most of the men, yet it was Pelivar and Culhan and the like who rode with the soldiers;
they could still make this flare up in her face like a barrel of lamp oil.
“Find Sheriam,” she growled, “and tell her to get everyone mounted now, no matter what it
takes!” She could not give the Sitters a night to think about what had happened today, to plan and plot.
They had to be back in camp before the sun went down.

CHAPTER
19

The Law

G

etting the Sitters to their mounts proved no bother; they were as eager to be away as
Egwene, especially Romanda and Lelaine, both cold as the wind and with eyes like
thunderclouds. The rest were the very image of cool-eyed Aes Sedai serenity, giving off
composure like a heavy scent, yet they glided to their horses so quickly that the nobles were left
gaping and the brightly clad servants scrambled in loading the packhorses to catch up as best
they could.
Egwene had Daishar set a hard pace in the snow, and with no more than a look and a nod from
her Lord Bryne made sure the armored escorts moved as fast. Siuan on Bela and Sheriam on Wing
rushed to join her. For long stretches they churned through fetlock-deep cover, the horses stepping
high at near to a trot, the Flame of Tar Valon rippling in the icy breeze, and even when it was
necessary to slow, when the horses were sinking knee-deep through the snow crust, they kept to a fast
walk.
The Sitters had no choice except to keep up, and their speed cut down their opportunity to talk on
the way. At that tiring pace, a lack of attention to your horse could bring a broken leg for the animal
and a broken neck for you. Even so, Romanda and Lelaine each managed to gather her coterie around
her, and those two knots floundered through the snow surrounded by wards against eavesdropping.
The pair seemed to be delivering tirades. Egwene could imagine the topic. For that matter, other
Sitters managed to ride together for a time, exchanging a few words quietly and casting cool glances
sometimes at her and sometimes at the sisters wrapped around by saidar. Only Delana never joined
one of those brief conversations. She stayed close beside Halima, who at last admitted that she was
cold. Face tight, the country woman held her cloak close around her, but she still tried to comfort
Delana, whispering to her almost constantly. Delana seemed to need comforting; her brows were
drawn down, putting a crease in her forehead that actually made her seem aged.
She was not the only one worried. The others masked the feeling rigidly, radiating absolute
poise, but the Warders rode like men expecting the worst to leap out of the snow at the next step, eyes
shifting in an unceasing watch, disquieting cloaks streaming in the wind to leave hands free. When an
Aes Sedai worried, her Warder worried, and the Sitters were too absorbed to think of calming the
men. Egwene was just as glad to see it. If the Sitters were troubled, they had not yet made up their

minds.
When Bryne rode out to confer with Uno, she took the opportunity to ask what the two women
had learned about Aes Sedai and Tower Guards in Andor.
“Not much,” Siuan replied in a tight voice. Shaggy Bela did not seem to be having any difficulty
with the pace, but Siuan did, gripping her reins tightly in one hand and the pommel of her saddle with
the other. “As near as I can make out, there are fifty rumors and no facts. It’s a likely sort of tale to
spring up, but it might still be true.” Bela lurched, her front hooves sinking deep, and Siuan gasped.
“The Light burn all horses!”
Sheriam had learned no more. She shook her head, and sighed irritably. “It sounds all feathers
and nonsense to me, Mother. There are always rumors of sisters sneaking about. Didn’t you ever learn
to ride, Siuan?” she added, her voice suddenly dripping derision. “By tonight, you’ll be too sore to
walk!” Sheriam’s nerves must have been ragged for her to burst out so openly. From the way she kept
shifting in her saddle, she had already achieved her prediction for Siuan.
Siuan’s eyes hardened, and she opened her mouth already half snarling, never mind who was
watching from behind the banner.
“Be still, both of you!” Egwene snapped. She took a deep, calming breath. She was a bit ragged
herself. Whatever Arathelle believed, any force Elaida sent to interfere with them would be too large
for sneaking. That left the Black Tower, a disaster in the making. You got further plucking the chicken
in front of you than trying to start on one up a tree. Especially when the tree was in another country
and there might not even be another chicken.
Still, she bit off her words in giving Sheriam instructions for once they reached the camp. She
was the Amyrlin Seat, and that meant all Aes Sedai were her responsibility, even those following
Elaida. Her voice was rock steady, though. It was too late to be frightened once you grabbed the wolf
by the ears.
Sheriam’s tilted eyes went wide at the orders. “Mother, if I may ask, why . . . ?” She trailed off
under Egwene’s level gaze, and swallowed. “It will be as you say, Mother,” she said slowly.
“Strange. I remember the day you and Nynaeve came to the Tower, two girls who couldn’t decide
whether to be excited or frightened. So much has changed since then. Everything.”
“Nothing stays the same forever,” Egwene told her. She gave Siuan a significant look, but Siuan
refused to see. She appeared to be sulking. Sheriam looked sick.
Lord Bryne returned then, and he must have sensed the mood among them. Aside from saying that
they were making good time, he kept his mouth shut. A wise man.
Making good time or not, the sun was sitting almost on the treetops when they finally rode
through the army’s sprawling camp. Wagons and tents cast long shadows across the snow, and a
number of men were hard at work building yet more low shelters out of brush. There were not nearly
enough tents, even for all the soldiers, and the camp held almost as many harnessmakers and
laundresses and fletchers and the like, all those who inevitably followed any army. The ringing of
anvils spoke of farriers and armorers and blacksmiths still at their labors. Cook fires were burning
everywhere, and the cavalry peeled away, eager for warmth and hot food as soon as their wearily
plodding animals were cared for. Surprisingly, Bryne rode on at Egwene’s side after she dismissed
him.
“If you will allow, Mother,” he said, “I thought I might accompany you a while longer.” Sheriam
actually twisted in her saddle to stare in astonishment. Siuan stared, too, straight ahead, as if not
daring to turn her suddenly wide eyes toward him.
What did he think he could do? Act as her bodyguard? Against sisters? That fellow with the

drippy nose would do as well. Reveal just how completely he was on her side? Tomorrow was time
enough for that, if all went well tonight; that revelation now might easily stampede the Hall in
directions she hardly dared contemplate.
“Tonight is for Aes Sedai business,” she told him firmly. But, silly as the suggestion was, he had
offered to put himself at risk for her. There was no telling his reasons—who knew why a man did
anything?—yet she owed him for that. Among other things. “Unless I send Siuan to you tonight, Lord
Bryne, you should leave before morning. If blame for today attaches itself to me, it might reflect on
you, too. Staying could prove dangerous. Even fatal. I don’t think they would need much excuse.” No
need to name who “they” were.
“I gave my word,” he replied quietly, patting Traveler’s neck. “To Tar Valon.” Pausing, he
glanced toward Siuan. It was less a hesitation than a consideration. “Whatever tonight’s business is,”
he said finally, “remember that you have thirty thousand men and Gareth Bryne behind you. That
should count for something, even among Aes Sedai. Until tomorrow, Mother.” Reining his big-nosed
bay around, he called over his shoulder, “I expect to see you tomorrow, too, Siuan. Nothing changes
that.” Siuan stared at his back as he rode away. There was anguish in her eyes.
Egwene could not help staring, too. He had never been so open before, not nearly. Why now, of
all times?
Crossing the forty or fifty paces that separated the army’s camp from the Aes Sedai’s, she
nodded to Sheriam, who drew rein at the first tents. She and Siuan rode on. Behind them, Sheriam’s
voice rose, surprisingly clear and steady. “The Amyrlin Seat calls the Hall to sit this day in formal
session. Let preparations be made with all speed.” Egwene did not look back.
At her tent, a bony groom kicking her layered woolen skirts came running to take Daishar and
Bela. Her face was pinched, and she barely ducked her head before hurrying away with the horses as
quickly as she had come. The warmth of the glowing braziers inside was like a fist closing down.
Egwene had not realized how cold it was outside until then. Or how cold she was.
Chesa took her cloak, and exclaimed when she felt her hands. “Why, you’re ice to the bone,
Mother.” Chattering away, she bustled around folding Egwene’s cloak and Siuan’s, smoothing the
neatly turned-down blankets on Egwene’s cot, touching a tray set on one of the chests that had been
pulled down from the stack. “I’d jump right into bed, with hot bricks all around, if I was that chilled.
As soon as I’d eaten, anyway. Warm outside does only so much good without warm inside. I’ll fetch a
few extra bricks to tuck under your feet while you sup. And for Siuan Sedai, of course. Oh, if I was as
hungry as you must be, I know I’d be tempted to gulp my food, but that always gives me pains in the
stomach.” Pausing by the tray, she eyed Egwene, and nodded with satisfaction when she said that she
would not eat too fast.
Making a sober answer was not easy. Chesa was always refreshing, but after today, Egwene
almost laughed with pleasure. There were no complications to Chesa. Two white bowls of lentil stew
stood on the tray, along with a tall pitcher of spiced wine, two silver cups, and two large rolls.
Somehow, the woman had known Siuan would be eating with her. Steam rose from the bowls and
pitcher. How often had Chesa had to change that tray to make sure warm food greeted Egwene
straightaway? Simple and uncomplicated. And as caring as a mother. Or a friend.
“I must forgo bed for now, Chesa. I’ve work yet tonight. Would you leave us?”
Siuan shook her head as the tentflap fell behind the plump woman. “Are you sure she hasn’t been
in your service since you were a babe?” she muttered.
Taking one of the bowls, a roll, and a spoon, Egwene settled into her chair with a sigh. She also
embraced the Source and warded the tent against listeners. Unfortunately, saidar made her all that

much more aware of half-frozen hands and feet. The bits in between were not much warmer. The
bowl seemed almost too warm to handle, and the roll, as well. Oh, how she would have loved to
have those hot bricks.
“Is there anything more we can do?” she asked, and promptly gulped down a spoonful of stew.
She was ravenous, and no wonder, with nothing since breakfast and that early. Lentils and woody
carrots tasted like her mother’s finest cooking. “I can’t think of anything, but can you?”
“What can be done, has been. There isn’t anything else, short of the Creator putting a hand in.”
Siuan took the other bowl and dropped onto the low stool, but then she sat staring into her stew and
stirring it with her spoon. “You wouldn’t really tell him, would you?” she said finally. “I couldn’t
bear if he knew.”
“Why on earth not?”
“He’d take advantage,” Siuan said darkly. “Oh, not that. I don’t think that.” She was quite
prudish in some areas. “But the man would make my life the Pit of Doom!” And washing his
smallclothes and polishing his boots and his saddle every day was not?
Egwene sighed. How could such a sensible, intelligent, capable woman turn into a scatterbrain
over this one subject? Like a hissing viper, an image rose in her head. Herself, sitting on Gawyn’s
knee playing kissing games. In a tavern! She shoved it away, hard. “Siuan, I need your experience. I
need your brain. I can’t afford to have you half-witted because of Lord Bryne. If you can’t pull
yourself together, I’ll pay him what you owe, and forbid you to see him. I will.”
“I said I’d work off the debt,” Siuan said stubbornly. “I have as much honor as Lord Gareth
bloody Bryne! As much and more! He keeps his word, and I keep mine! Besides, Min told me I have
to stay close to him or we’ll both die. Or something like that.” A pinkness in her cheeks gave her
away, though. Her honor and Min’s viewing notwithstanding, she was simply willing to put up with
anything to be near the man!
“Very well. You’re besotted, and if I tell you to stay away from him, you’ll either disobey or
mope and wrap the rest of your brains in a cloud. What are you going to do about him?”
Scowling indignantly, Siuan went on for some little time, growling what she would like to do
about Gareth bloody Bryne. He would have enjoyed none of it. Some, he might not have survived.
“Siuan,” Egwene said warningly. “You deny one more time what’s plain as your nose, and I’ll
tell him and give him the money.”
Siuan pouted sullenly. She pouted! Sullenly! Siuan! “I don’t have time to be in love. I barely
have time to think, between working for you and him. And even if everything goes right tonight, I’ll
have twice as much to do. Besides. . . .” Her face fell, and she shifted on the stool. “What if he
doesn’t . . . return my feelings?” she muttered. “He’s never even tried to kiss me. All he cares about is
whether his shirts are clean.”
Egwene scraped her spoon through her bowl, and was surprised when it came up empty. Nothing
remained of the roll but a few crumbs on her dress. Light, her middle still felt hollow. She eyed
Siuan’s bowl hopefully; the woman seemed to have little interest in anything but drawing circles in
the lentils.
A sudden thought occurred to her. Why had Lord Bryne insisted that Siuan work off her debt
even after learning who she was? Just because she had said she would? It was a preposterous
arrangement. Except that it did keep her close to him when nothing else would have. For that matter,
she herself had often wondered why Bryne had agreed to build the army. He had to have known there
was a very good chance he was laying his head on the chopping block. And why he had offered that
army to her, a girl Amyrlin with no real authority and not a friend among the sisters except Siuan, as

far as he knew? Could the answer to all of those questions be as simple as . . . he loved Siuan? No;
most men were frivolous and flighty, but that was truly preposterous! Still, she offered the suggestion,
if only to amuse Siuan. It might cheer her a little.
Siuan snorted in disbelief. It sounded odd, coming from that pretty face, but no one could put
quite so much expression into a snort as she did. “He’s not a total idiot,” she said dryly. “In fact, he
has a good head on his shoulders. He thinks like a woman, most of the time.”
“I still haven’t heard you say you’ll straighten up, Siuan,” Egwene persisted. “You have to, one
way or another.”
“Well, of course I will. I don’t know what’s been the matter with me. It isn’t as if I never kissed
a man before.” Her eyes narrowed suddenly, as if she expected Egwene to challenge her on that. “I
haven’t spent my whole life in the Tower. This is ridiculous! Chattering about men, tonight of all
nights!” Peering into her bowl, she seemed to realize for the first time that it held food. She filled her
spoon, gesturing with it at Egwene. “You have to be careful of your timing, more now than ever. If
Romanda or Lelaine grabs the tiller, you’ll never get your hands on it.”
Ridiculous or not, something certainly had restored Siuan’s appetite. She went through her stew
faster than Egwene had hers, and not a crumb of the roll escaped her. Egwene found that she had
drawn her fingers through her own empty bowl. There was nothing for it then but to lick off the last
few lentils, of course.
Discussing what was to happen tonight served no real point. They had honed and refined what
Egwene was to say, and when, so many times that she was surprised she had not dreamed of it. She
certainly could have done her part in her sleep. Siuan insisted anyway, skirting very near the point
where Egwene would have to call her down, going over it again and again, bringing up possibilities
they had discussed before a hundred times. Strangely, Siuan had found herself a very good mood. She
even essayed a little humor, unusual for her of late, though some was on the gallows side.
“You know Romanda wanted to be Amyrlin herself once,” she said at one point. “I’ve heard it
was Tamra getting the stole and staff that made her stalk off into retirement like a gull with her tail
feathers clipped. I’ll lay a silver mark I don’t have to a fish scale that her eyes bulge twice as much as
Lelaine’s.”
And later. “I wish I could be there to hear them howl. Somebody’s going to before much longer,
and I’d rather it was them than us. I never had the voice for singing.” She actually sang a little snatch
about staring across the river at a boy and having no boat. She was right; her voice was pleasant in its
fashion, but she could not carry a tune in a bucket.
And later still. “A good thing I have such a sweet face now. If this goes badly, they’ll dress the
pair of us for dolls and sit us on a shelf to admire. Of course, we might have ‘accidents’ instead.
Dolls do get broken. Gareth Bryne will have to find someone else to bully.” She really laughed at
that.
Egwene felt considerable relief when the tentflap bulged inward briefly, announcing someone
who knew enough not to enter where there was a ward. She really did not want to hear where Siuan’s
humor went from there!
As soon as she released the ward, Sheriam stepped inside, accompanied by a rush of air that
seemed ten times as cold as earlier. “It’s time, Mother. Everything is ready.” Her tilted eyes were
wide, and she licked her lips with the tip of her tongue.
Siuan bounded to her feet and seized her cloak from Egwene’s cot, but she paused in the act of
draping it on her shoulders. “I have sailed the Fingers of the Dragon in the dark, you know,” she said
seriously. “And netted a lionfish once, with my father. It can be done.”

Sheriam frowned as Siuan darted out, letting in more cold. “Sometimes, I think,” she began, but
whatever she sometimes thought, she did not share. “Why are you doing this, Mother?” she asked
instead. “All of it, today at the lake, calling the Hall tonight. Why did you have us spend all day
yesterday talking about Logain to everybody we met? I’d think you might share it with me. I am your
Keeper. I did swear fealty.”
“I tell you what you need to know,” Egwene said, swinging her cloak around her shoulders.
There was no need to say that she trusted a forced oath only so far, even a sister’s. And Sheriam
might find a reason to let a word slip into the wrong ear despite that oath. After all, Aes Sedai were
noted for finding loopholes in what they had said. She did not really believe that would happen, but
just as with Lord Bryne, she could not take even small chances unless she had to.
“I have to tell you,” Sheriam said bitterly, “I think tomorrow Romanda or Lelaine will be your
Keeper of the Chronicles, and I’ll be serving a penance for not warning the Hall. And I think you
might envy me.”
Egwene nodded. All too possible. “Shall we go?”
The sun made a red dome on the treetops to the west, and a lurid light shone off the snow.
Servants marked Egwene’s passage along the deep paths with silent bows and curtsies. Their faces
were troubled or else blank; servants could pick up the moods of those they served almost as quickly
as Warders.
Not a sister was to be seen, at first, and then they all were, in a great gathering three deep around
a pavilion set up in the only open space in the camp large enough, the area used by sisters Skimming
to the dovecotes in Salidar and Traveling back with reports from the eyes-and-ears. A large muchmended piece of heavy canvas, not a patch on the splendor of the canopy at the lake, it had been a
great deal of effort to set up. Most often in the past two months, the Hall had convened much as they
had yesterday morning, or perhaps squeezed into one of the larger tents. The pavilion had been
erected only twice since leaving Salidar. Both times for a trial.
Noticing Egwene and Sheriam’s approach, sisters in the back murmured to those ahead, and a
gap opened to let them through. Expressionless eyes watched the pair of them, giving not a clue to
whether the watching sisters knew or even suspected what was happening. Not a clue to what they
thought. Butterflies stirred in Egwene’s stomach. A rosebud. Calm.
She stepped onto the layered carpets, woven in bright flowers and a dozen different patterns, and
moved through the ring of braziers set up around the canopy’s rim, and Sheriam began. “She comes;
she comes. . . .” If she sounded a little less grand than usual, a touch nervous, it was small wonder.
The polished benches and cloth-covered boxes from the lake were in use again. They made a
much more formal sight than the mismatched gaggle of chairs that had been used previously, two
slanting lines of nine, grouped by threes; Green, Gray and Yellow to one side, White, Brown and
Blue to the other. At the wide end, farthest from Egwene, stood the striped box and bench for the
Amyrlin Seat. Sitting there, she would be the focus of every eye, very much aware that she was one
facing eighteen. As well she had not changed her clothes; every Sitter still wore her finery from the
lake, only adding her shawl. A rosebud. Calm.
One of the benches was empty, though only for a moment longer. Delana came running in just as
Sheriam finished her litany. Looking breathless and flustered, the Gray Sitter scrambled up to her
seat, between Varilin and Kwamesa, with little of her usual grace. She wore a sickly grin, and toyed
nervously with the firedrops around her neck. Anyone might have thought she was the one on trial.
Calm. No one was on trial. Yet.
Egwene started slowly across the carpets, between the two rows, with Sheriam close behind,

and Kwamesa stood. The light of saidar suddenly shone around the dark slender woman, youngest of
the Sitters. Tonight there would be no skimping of the formalities. “What is brought before the Hall of
the Tower is for the Hall alone to consider,” Kwamesa announced. “Whosoever intrudes unbidden,
woman or man, initiate or outsider, whether they come in peace or in anger, I will bind according to
the law, to face the law. Know that what I speak is true; it will and shall be done.”
That formula was older than the oath against speaking untruth, from a time when almost as many
Amyrlins died by assassination as by all other causes put together. Egwene continued her measured
tread. It was an effort not to touch her stole, for a reminder. She tried to concentrate on the bench
ahead.
Kwamesa resumed her seat, still shining with the Power, and among the Whites, Aledrin rose,
the glow surrounding her as well. With her dark golden hair and big pale brown eyes, she was quite
lovely when she smiled, but tonight a stone had more expression than she. “There are those within
earshot who are not of the Hall,” she said in a cool voice strong with the accents of Tarabon. “What
is spoken in the Hall of the Tower is for the Hall alone to hear, until and unless the Hall decides
otherwise. I will make us private. I will seal our words to our ears only.” Weaving a ward that
walled the entire pavilion, she sat. There was a stir among the sisters outside, who now must watch
the Hall move in utter silence.
Strange, that so much among Sitters depended on age, when distinction by age was next to
anathema among the rest of Aes Sedai. Could Siuan have seen a pattern in the Sitters’ ages? No.
Focus. Calm, and focus.
Gripping the edges of her cloak, Egwene stepped up onto the brightly striped box and turned.
Lelaine was already on her feet, blue-fringed shawl looped across her arms, and Romanda was
rising, without even waiting for Egwene to sit. She dared not let either seize the tiller. “I call a
question before the Hall,” she said in a loud, firm voice. “Who will stand to declare war against the
usurper Elaida do Avriny a’Roihan?”
And then she sat, throwing off her cloak and letting it fall across the bench. Standing beside her
on the carpets, Sheriam appeared quite cool and collected, but she made a small sound, almost a
whimper. Egwene did not think anyone else had heard. She hoped not.
There was a brief moment of shock, women frozen on their seats, staring at her in amazement.
Perhaps as much because she had asked at all as what she had asked. No one put a question before the
Hall before sounding out the Sitters; it just was not done, for practical reasons as much as tradition.
At last Lelaine spoke. “We do not declare war on individuals,” she said in a dry voice. “Not
even on traitors like Elaida. In any case, I call to shelve your question while we deal with more
immediate matters.” She had had time to gather herself since the ride back; her face was merely hard
now, not thunderous. Brushing blue-slashed skirts as if brushing away Elaida—or perhaps Egwene—
she turned her attention to the other Sitters. “What brings us to sit tonight is. . . . I was about to say
simple, but it isn’t. Open the novice book? We would have grandmothers clamoring to be tested.
Remain here a month? I hardly need list the difficulties, beginning with spending half our gold without
coming a foot nearer Tar Valon. And as for not crossing into Andor—”
“My sister Lelaine, in her anxiety, has forgotten who has the right to speak first,” Romanda cut in
smoothly. Her smile managed to make Lelaine appear merry. Still, she took her time adjusting her
shawl just as she wanted, a woman with all the time in the world. “I have two questions to call before
the Hall, and in the second I will address Lelaine’s concerns. Unfortunately for her, my first question
concerns Lelaine’s own fitness to continue in the Hall.” Her smile widened without growing the
slightest bit warmer. Lelaine sat slowly, her scowl quite open.

A question of war cannot be shelved,” Egwene said in a carrying tone. “It must be answered
before any question called after it. That is the law.”
Quick, questioning glances passed between Sitters.
“Is that so?” Janya said finally. Squinting thoughtfully, she twisted on her bench to address the
woman next to her. “Takima, you remember everything you read, and I’m sure I remember you saying
you had read the Law of War. Is that what it says?”
Egwene held her breath. The White Tower had sent soldiers to any number of wars over the last
thousand years, but always in response to a plea for help from at least two thrones, and it always had
been their war, not the Tower’s. The last time the Tower itself actually declared war had been
against Artur Hawkwing. Siuan said that now only a few librarians knew much more than that there
was a Law of War.
Short, with long dark hair to her waist and skin the color of aged ivory, Takima often reminded
people of a bird, tilting her head in thought. Now she looked like a bird that wanted to take flight,
shifting on her seat, adjusting her shawl, unnecessarily straightening her cap of pearls and sapphires.
“It is,” she said finally, and clamped her mouth shut.
Egwene quietly started breathing again.
“It seems,” Romanda said in a clipped tone, “that Siuan Sanche has been teaching you well.
Mother. How speak you in support of declaring war? On a woman.” She sounded as if she were
trying to push something disagreeable out of her way, and she dropped onto her seat waiting for it to
depart.
Egwene nodded graciously anyway, and rose. She met the Sitters’ gazes one by one, levelly,
firmly. Takima avoided her eyes. Light, the woman knew! But she had not said anything. Would she
hold silent long enough? It was too late to change plans.
“Today we find ourselves confronted by an army, led by people who doubt us. That army would
not be there otherwise.” Egwene wanted to put passion into her voice, to let it burst out, but Siuan had
advised utter coolness, and finally she had agreed. They needed to see a woman in control of herself,
not a girl being ridden by her heart. The words came from her heart, though. “You heard Arathelle say
she did not want to become entangled in Aes Sedai affairs. Yet they were willing to bring an army
into Murandy and stand in our way. Because they are not certain who we are, or what we are about.
Did any of you feel that they truly believe you are Sitters?” Malind, round-faced and fierce-eyed,
shifted on her bench among the Greens, and so did Salita, twitching her yellow-fringed shawl, though
her dark face managed to hide any expression. Berana, another Sitter chosen in Salidar, frowned
thoughtfully. Egwene did not mention the reaction to her as Amyrlin; if that thought was not already in
their heads, she did not want to plant it.
“We’ve listed Elaida’s crimes to countless nobles,” she went on. “We’ve told them we intend to
remove her. But they doubt. They think that maybe—maybe—we are what we say. And maybe there’s
a trick in our words. Perhaps we are only Elaida’s hand, weaving some elaborate scheme. Doubt
leaves people floundering. Doubt gave Pelivar and Arathelle the nerve to stand before Aes Sedai and
say, ‘You cannot go further.’ Who else will stand in our way, or interfere, because they aren’t certain,
and uncertainty leads them to act in a cloud of confusion? There’s only one way for us to dispel their
confusion. We have already done everything else. Once we declare ourselves at war with Elaida,
there can be no doubts. I don’t say that Arathelle and Pelivar and Aemlyn will march away as soon as
we do so, but they and everyone else will know who we are. No one will dare again to show doubt
so openly when you say you are the Hall of the Tower. No one will dare stand in our way, meddling
in the affairs of the Tower through uncertainty and ignorance. We have walked to the door and put our

hands on the latch. If you are afraid to walk through, then you all but ask the world to believe that you
are nothing but Elaida’s puppets.”
She sat, surprised at how calm she felt. Beyond the two rows of Sitters, sisters outside stirred,
putting their heads together. She could imagine the excited murmurs that Aledrin’s ward blocked off.
Now if only Takima kept her mouth shut long enough.
Romanda grunted impatiently, and stood only long enough to say, “Who stands for declaring war
against Elaida?” Her gaze returned to Lelaine, and her cold, smug smile returned. It was clear what
she considered important, once this nonsense was done with.
Janya rose immediately, the long brown fringe on her shawl swaying. “We might as well,” she
said. She was not supposed to speak, but her set jaw and sharp gaze dared anyone to call her down.
She was not normally so forceful, but as usual, her words nearly tripped over one another. “Mending
what the world knows won’t be any harder than it is for this. Well? Well? I don’t see the point of
waiting.” On the other side of Takima, Escaralde nodded and stood.
Moria all but bounded to her feet, frowning down at Lyrelle, who gathered her skirts as if to
rise, then hesitated and looked at Lelaine questioningly. Lelaine was too busy frowning across the
carpets at Romanda to notice.
Among the Greens, Samalin and Malind stood together, and Faiselle looked up with a jerk. A
stocky, copper-skinned Domani, Faiselle was not a woman startled by much, but she looked startled
now, her square face swinging wide-eyed from Samalin to Malind and back.
Salita rose, carefully adjusting the yellow fringe of her shawl and just as carefully avoiding
Romanda’s sudden frown. Kwamesa stood, and then Aledrin, drawing Berana up by her sleeve.
Delana twisted completely around on her bench, peering at the sisters outside. Even in silence the
spectators’ excitement communicated itself in constant shifting, heads going together, eyes darting
toward the Sitters. Delana rose slowly, both hands pressed to her middle, looking ready to sick up on
the spot. Takima grimaced and stared at her hands on her knees. Saroiya studied the other two White
Sitters, tugging at her ear the way she did when deep in thought. But no one else moved to stand.
Egwene felt bile rising in her own throat. Ten. Just ten. She had been so sure. Siuan had been so
sure. Logain alone should have been enough, given their ignorance of the law involved. Pelivar’s
army and Arathelle refusing to admit that they were Sitters should have primed them like a pump.
“For the love of the Light!” Moria burst out. Rounding on Lyrelle and Lelaine, she planted her
fists on her hips. If Janya’s speaking had gone against custom, this tied it in a knot. Displays of anger
were strictly forbidden in the Hall, but Moria’s eyes blazed, and her Illianer accent was thick with it.
“Why do you wait? Elaida did steal the stole and the staff! Elaida’s Ajah did make Logain a false
Dragon, and only the Light knows how many other men! No woman in the history of the Tower did
ever deserve this declaration more! Stand, or hold silent from now about your resolve to remove
her!”
Lelaine did not quite stare, but by her expression you might have thought she had found herself
attacked by a sparrow. “This is hardly worth a vote, Moria,” she said in a tight voice. “We will
speak later about decorum, you and I. Still, if you need a demonstration of resolve. . . .” With a sharp
sniff, she rose, and gave a jerk of her head that pulled Lyrelle to her feet like strings. Lelaine seemed
surprised that it did not pull up Faiselle and Takima, too.
Far from standing, Takima grunted as if struck. Disbelief bright on her face, she ran her eyes
along the women on their feet, obviously counting. And then did it again. Takima, who remembered
everything the first time.
Egwene breathed deep in relief. It was done. She could hardly believe. After a moment, she

cleared her throat, and Sheriam actually jumped.
Green eyes as big as teacups, the Keeper cleared her throat, too. “The lesser consensus standing,
war is declared against Elaida do Avriny a’Roihan.” Her voice was none too steady, but it sufficed.
“In the interest of unity, I ask for the greater consensus to stand.”
Faiselle half-moved, then clenched her hands in her lap. Saroiya opened her mouth, then closed
it without speaking, her face troubled. No one else stirred.
“You won’t get it,” Romanda said flatly. The sneer she directed across the pavilion at Lelaine
was as good as a statement of why she, at least, would not stand. “Now that little business is finished,
we can go on with—”
“I don’t think we can,” Egwene cut in. “Takima, what does the Law of War say about the
Amyrlin Seat?” Romanda was left with her mouth hanging open.
Takima’s lips writhed. The diminutive Brown looked more than ever a bird wishing to take
flight. “The Law . . . .” she began, then took a deep breath and sat up straight. “The Law of War states,
‘As one set of hands must guide a sword, so the Amyrlin Seat shall direct and prosecute the war by
decree. She shall seek the advice of the Hall of the Tower, but the Hall shall carry out her decrees
with all possible speed, and for the sake of unity, they shall. . . .” She faltered, and had to visibly
force herself to go on. “. . . they shall and must approve any decree of the Amyrlin Seat regarding
prosecution of the war with the greater consensus.”
A long silence stretched. Every eye seemed to be goggling. Turning abruptly, Delana vomited
onto the carpets behind her bench. Kwamesa and Salita both climbed down and started toward her,
but she waved them off, plucking a scarf from her sleeve to wipe her mouth. Magla and Saroiya and
several others still seated looked as though they might follow her example. No others who had been
chosen in Salidar, though. Romanda appeared ready to bite through a nail.
“Very clever,” Lelaine said at last in clipped tones, and after a deliberate pause, added,
“Mother. Will you tell us what the great wisdom of your vast experience tells you to do? About the
war, I mean. I want to make myself clear.”
“Let me make myself clear, too,” Egwene said coldly. Leaning forward, she fixed the Blue Sitter
sternly. “A certain degree of respect is required toward the Amyrlin Seat, and from now on, I will
have it, daughter. This is no time for me to have to unchair you and name a penance.” Lelaine’s eyes
crept wider and wider with shock. Had the woman really believed everything would continue as
before? Or after so long not daring to show more than the tiniest backbone, had Lelaine simply
believed she had none? Egwene really did not want to unchair her; the Blues would almost certainly
return the woman, and she still had to deal with the Hall on matters that could not be convincingly
disguised as part of the war against Elaida.
From the corner of her eye, she saw a smile pass across Romanda’s lips at seeing Lelaine set
down. Small profit if all she did was raise Romanda’s stock with the others. “That holds for
everyone, Romanda,” she said. “If need be, Tiana can find two birches as easily as one.” Romanda’s
smile vanished abruptly.
“If I may speak, Mother,” Takima said, rising slowly. She attempted a smile, but she still looked
decidedly ill. “I myself think you have begun well. There may be benefits to stopping here a month.
Or longer.” Romanda’s head jerked around to stare at her, but for once, Takima did not appear to
notice. “Wintering here, we can avoid worse weather farther north, and also plan carefully—”
“There’s an end to delays, daughter,” Egwene cut in. “No more dragging our feet.” Would she be
another Gerra, or another Shein? Either was still possible. “In one month, we will Travel from here.”
No; she was Egwene al’Vere, and whatever the secret histories would say of her faults and virtues,

the Light only knew, but they would be hers, not copies of some other woman’s. “In one month, we
will begin the siege of Tar Valon.”
This time, the silence was broken only by the sound of Takima weeping.

CHAPTER
20

Into Andor

E layne hoped that the journey to Caemlyn would go smoothly, and in the beginning, it seemed
to do so. She thought that even as she and Aviendha and Birgitte sat bone-weary and huddled in
the rags that remained of their clothing, filthy with dirt and dust and the blood of the injuries they
had received when the gateway exploded. In two weeks at most, she would be ready to present
her claims to the Lion Throne. There on the hilltop, Nynaeve Healed their numerous hurts and
spoke barely a word, certainly not berating them. Surely that was a pleasant sign, if unusual.
Relief at finding them alive battled worry on her face.
Lan’s strength was necessary to remove the Seanchan crossbow bolt from Birgitte’s thigh before
she could be Healed of that wound, but although her face drained of blood and Elayne felt a stab of
agony through the bond, agony that made her want to cry out, her Warder barely groaned through her
gritted teeth.
“Tai’shar Kandor,” Lan murmured, tossing the pile-head quarrel, made to punch through armor,
aside on the ground. True blood of Kandor. Birgitte blinked, and he paused. “Forgive me, if I erred. I
assumed from your clothes you were Kandori.”
“Oh, yes,” Birgitte breathed. “Kandori.” Her sickly grin might have been from her injuries;
Nynaeve was impatiently shooing Lan out of the way so she could lay hands on her. Elayne hoped the
woman knew more of Kandor than the name; when Birgitte had last been born, there had been no
Kandor. She should have taken it as an omen.
For the five miles to the small slate-roofed manor house, Birgitte rode behind Nynaeve on the
latter’s stout brown mare—named Loversknot, of all things—and Elayne and Aviendha rode Lan’s
tall black stallion. At least, Elayne sat Mandarb’s saddle with Aviendha’s arms around her waist
while Lan led the fiery-eyed animal. Trained warhorses were as much weapons as a sword, and
dangerous mounts for strange riders. Be sure of yourself, girl, Lini had always told her, but not too
sure, and she did try. She should have realized events were no more in her control than Mandarb’s
reins.
At the three-story stone house, Master Hornwell, stout and grayhaired, and Mistress Hornwell,
slightly less round and slightly less gray but otherwise resembling her husband remarkably, had every

last person who worked the estates, and Merilille’s maid, Pol, and the green-and-white liveried
servants who had come from the Tarasin Palace as well, all bustling to find sleeping accommodations
for over two hundred people, most women, who had appeared out of nowhere with dark near to
falling. The work went with surprising swiftness, in spite of the estates’ people stopping to gawk at
an Aes Sedai’s ageless face, or a Warder’s shifting cloak making parts of him vanish, or one of the
Sea Folk with all of her bright silks, her earrings and nosering and medallioned chain. Kinswomen
were deciding that now it was safe to be frightened and cry no matter what Reanne and the Knitting
Circle said to them; Windfinders were snarling over how far from the salt they had come, against
their will as Renaile din Calon loudly claimed; and nobles and craftswomen who had been all too
willing to flee whatever lay back in Ebou Dar, willing to carry their bundled possessions on their
backs, were now balking at being shown a hayloft for a bed.
All that was going on when Elayne and the others arrived with the sun red on the western
horizon, a great upheaval and milling all about the house and thatch-roofed outbuildings, but Alise
Tenjile, smiling pleasantly and implacable as an avalanche, seemed to have everything more in hand
than even the capable Hornwells. Kinswomen who wept harder for all of Reanne’s attempts at
comfort dried their tears at a murmur from Alise and began moving with the purposeful air of women
who had been caring for themselves in a hostile world for many years. Haughty nobles with marriage
knives dangling into the oval cutouts in their lace-trimmed bodices and craftswomen who displayed
almost as much arrogance and nearly as much bosom, if not in silk, flinched at the sight of Alise
approaching, and went scurrying for the tall barns hugging their bundles and announcing loudly that
they had always thought it might be amusing to sleep on straw. Even the Windfinders, many of them
important and powerful women among the Atha’an Miere, muffled their complaints when Alise came
near. For that matter, Sareitha, still lacking the Aes Sedai agelessness, eyed Alise askance and
touched her brown-fringed shawl as if to remind herself it was there. Merilille—unflappable
Merilille—watched the woman go about her work with a blend of approval and open amazement.
Clambering down from her saddle at the front door of the house, Nynaeve glared toward Alise,
gave her dark braid one deliberate, measured tug that the other woman was far too busy to notice, and
stalked inside, stripping off her blue riding gloves and muttering to herself. Watching her go, Lan
chuckled softly, then stifled his laughter immediately when Elayne dismounted. Light, but his eyes
were cold! For Nynaeve’s sake, she hoped the man could be saved from his fate, yet looking into
those eyes, she did not believe it.
“Where is Ispan?” she murmured, helping Aviendha scramble down. So many of the women
knew an Aes Sedai—a Black sister—was being held prisoner that the news was bound to spread
through the estates like fire in dry grass, but better if the manor’s folk had a little preparation.
“Adeleas and Vandene took her to a small woodcutter’s hut about half a mile away,” he replied
just as quietly. “In all this, I don’t think anyone noticed a woman with a sack over her head. The
sisters said they would stay there with her tonight.”
Elayne shivered. The Darkfriend was to be questioned again once the sun went down, it seemed.
They were in Andor, now, and that made her feel more deeply as if she had given the order for it.
Soon she was in a copper bathtub, luxuriating in perfumed soap and clean skin again, laughing
and splashing water at Birgitte, who lolled in another tub except when she was splashing back, both
of them giggling over the wincing horror Aviendha could not quite conceal at sitting up to her breasts
in water. She thought it was a very good joke on herself, though, and told a most improper story about
a man getting segade spines in his bottom. Birgitte told one still more improper, about a woman
getting her head caught between the slats of a fence, that made even Aviendha blush. They were funny,

though. Elayne wished she knew one to tell.
She and Aviendha combed and brushed each other’s hair—a nightly ritual for near-sisters—and
then they snuggled tiredly into the canopied bed in a small room. She and Aviendha, Birgitte and
Nynaeve, and lucky there were no more. Larger rooms had cots and pallets covering the floors,
including the sitting rooms, the kitchens, and most of the halls. Nynaeve muttered half the night about
the indecency of making a woman sleep apart from her husband, and for the other half, her elbows
seemed to wake Elayne every time she dropped off. Birgitte flatly refused to change places, and she
could not ask Aviendha to endure the woman’s sharp prodding, so she did not get a great deal of
sleep.
Elayne was still groggy when they prepared to depart the next morning, with the rising sun a
molten ball of gold. The manor had few animals to spare unless she stripped the estates bare, so
while she rode a black gelding named Fireheart, and Aviendha and Birgitte had new mounts, those
who had been afoot when they fled the Kin’s farm remained afoot. That included most of the
Kinswomen themselves, the servants leading the pack animals, and the twenty-odd women who
plainly were beyond regretting their visit to the Kin’s farm in hopes of peace and contemplation. The
Warders rode ahead to scout the way across rolling hills covered in drought-starved forest, and the
rest of them stretched out in a most peculiar snake, with Nynaeve and herself and the other sisters at
the head. And Aviendha, of course.
It was hardly a group that could escape notice, so many women traveling with so few men for
guards, not to mention twenty dark Windfinders, awkward on their horses and as bright as exotically
plumaged birds, and eight Aes Sedai, five of them recognizably so to anyone who knew what to look
for. Though one did ride with a leather sack over her head, of course. As if that would not attract eyes
by itself. Elayne had hoped to reach Caemlyn unnoticed, but that no longer seemed possible. Still,
there was no reason that anyone would suspect that the Daughter-Heir, Elayne Trakand herself, was
one of this group. In the beginning, she thought that the greatest difficulty they might face would be
someone who opposed her claims learning of her presence, sending armed men to try taking her into
custody until the succession was settled.
In truth, she expected the first trouble to come from the footsore craftswomen and nobles, proud
women all, and none used to tramping dusty hills. Especially since Merilille’s maid had her own
plump mare to ride. The few farmwives among them did not seem to mind too much, but nearly half
their number were women who possessed lands and manors and palaces, and most of the rest could
have afforded to buy an estate if not two or three. They included two goldsmiths, three weavers who
owned over four hundred looms between them, a woman whose manufactories produced a tenth of all
the lacquerware Ebou Dar produced, and a banker. They walked, their possessions strapped to their
backs, while their horses bore packsaddles laden with food. There was real need. Every last coin in
everyone’s purse had been pooled together and given into Nynaeve’s tightfisted keeping, but all might
not be sufficient to buy food, fodder and lodgings for so large a party all the way to Caemlyn. They
did not seem to understand. They complained loudly and incessantly through the first day’s march.
Loudest of all was a slim lady with a thin scar on one cheek, a stern-faced woman named Malien,
who was nearly bent double under the weight of a huge bundle containing a dozen or more dresses
and all the changes that went with them.
When they made camp that first night, with their cook fires glowing in the twilight and everyone
full of beans and bread if not entirely satisfied with them, Malien gathered the noblewomen around
her, their silks more than travel-stained. The craftswomen joined in, too, and the banker, and the
farmers stood close. Before Malien could say a word, Reanne strode into the group. Her face full of

smile lines, in plain brown woolens with her skirts sewn up on the left to expose bright layered
petticoats, she might have been one of the farm women.
“If you wish to go home,” she announced in that surprisingly high voice, “you may do so at any
time. I regret that we must keep your horses, though. You will be paid for them as soon as can be
arranged. If you choose to remain, please remember that the rules of the farm still apply.” A number
of the women around her gaped. Malien was not alone in opening her mouth angrily.
Alise just seemed to appear at Reanne’s side, fists planted on her hips. She was not smiling
now. “I said the last ten to be ready would do the washing up,” she told them firmly. And she named
them off; Jillien, a plump goldsmith; Naiselle, the cool-eyed banker; and all eight of the nobles. They
stood staring at her until she clapped her hands and said, “Don’t make me invoke the rule on failure to
do your share of the chores.”
Malien, wide-eyed and muttering in disbelief, was the last to dart off and begin gathering dirty
bowls, but the next morning she pared her bundle down, leaving lace-trimmed silk dresses and shifts
to be trampled on the hillside as they departed. Elayne continued to expect an explosion, but Reanne
kept a firm hand on them, Alise kept a firmer, and if Malien and the others glared and muttered over
the grease stains that grew on their clothes day by day, Reanne had only to speak a few words to send
them to their work. Alise only had to clap her hands.
If the rest of the journey could have gone as smoothly, Elayne would have been willing to join
those women in their greasy labors. Long before reaching Caemlyn, she knew that for a fact.
Once they reached the first narrow dusty road, little more than cart track, farms began to appear,
thatched stone houses and barns clinging to the hillsides or nestled in hollows. From then on, whether
the land was hilly or flat, forested or cleared, they rarely spent many hours beyond sight of a farm or a
village. At each of those, while the local folk goggled at the very strange strangers, Elayne tried to
learn how much support House Trakand had, and what concerned the people most. Addressing those
concerns would be important in making her claim to the throne strong enough to stand, as important as
the backing of other Houses. She heard a great deal, if not always what she wished to hear. Andorans
claimed the right to speak their minds to the Queen herself; they were hardly shy with a young
noblewoman, no matter how peculiar her traveling companions.
In a village called Damelien, where three mills sat beside a small river shrunken to leave their
tall water-wheels dry, the square-jawed innkeeper at The Golden Sheaves allowed as how he thought
Morgase had been a good queen, the best that could be, the best that ever was. “Her daughter
might’ve been a good ruler, too, I suppose,” he muttered, thumbing his chin. “Pity the Dragon Reborn
killed them. I suppose he had to—the Prophecies or some such—but he had no call to dry up the
rivers, now did he? How much grain did you say your horses need, my lady? It’s dreadful dear,
mind.”
A hard-faced woman, in a worn brown dress that hung on her as if she had lost weight, surveyed
a field surrounded by a low stone wall, where the hot wind sent sheets of dust marching into the
woods. The other farms around Buryhill looked as bad or worse. “That Dragon Reborn’s got no right
to do this to us, now has he? I ask you!” She spat and frowned up at Elayne in her saddle. “The
throne? Oh, Dyelin’s as good as any, now Morgase and her girl are dead. Some around here still
speak up for Naean or Elenia, but I’m for Dyelin. Any lookout, Caemlyn’s a long way off. I’ve got
crops to worry about. If I ever make another crop.”
“Oh, it’s true, my lady, so it is; Elayne’s alive,” a gnarled old carpenter told her in Forel
Market. He was bald as a leather egg, his fingers twisted with age, but the work standing among the
shavings and sawdust that littered his shop looked as fine as any Elayne had seen. She was the only

person in the shop besides him. From the look of the village, half the residents had left. “The Dragon
Reborn is having her brought to Caemlyn so he can put the Rose Crown on her head himself,” he
allowed. “The news is all over. ’Tisn’t right, if you ask me. He’s one of them black-eyed Aielmen, I
hear. We ought to march on Caemlyn and drive him and all them Aiel back where they come from.
Then Elayne can claim the throne her own self. If Dyelin lets her keep it, anyway.”
Elayne heard a great deal about Rand, rumors ranging from him swearing fealty to Elaida to him
being the King of Illian, of all things. In Andor, he was blamed for everything bad that happened for
the last two or three years, including stillbirths and broken legs, infestations of grasshoppers, twoheaded calves, and three-legged chickens. And even people who thought her mother had ruined the
country and an end to the reign of House Trakand was good riddance still believed Rand al’Thor an
invader. The Dragon Reborn was supposed to fight the Dark One at Shayol Ghul, and he should be
driven out of Andor. Not what she had hoped to hear, not a bit of it. But she heard it all again and
again. It was not a pleasant journey at all. It was one long lesson in one of Lini’s favorite sayings. It
isn’t the stone you see that trips you on your nose.
She thought a number of things beside the nobles might cause trouble, some sure to be explosions
as great as the gateway. The Windfinders, smug in the bargain made with Nynaeve and herself,
behaved in an irritatingly superior manner toward the Aes Sedai, especially after it came out that
Merilille had let herself agree to be one of the first sisters to go on the ships. Yet if the sizzling there
continued like the burning of an Illuminator’s fuse-cord, the explosion never quite came. The
Windfinders and the Kinswomen, in particular the Knitting Circle, seemed as certain to blow up.
They cut one another dead when not sneering openly, the Kin at “Sea Folk wilders getting above
themselves,” the Windfinders at “cringing sandlappers kissing Aes Sedai feet.” But it never went
beyond lips curled or daggers caressed.
Ispan certainly presented problems that Elayne was sure would grow, yet after a few days,
Vandene and Adeleas let her ride unhooded if not unshielded, a silent figure with colored beads in
her thin braids, ageless face turned down and hands still on her reins. Renaile told everyone who
would listen that among the Atha’an Miere, a Darkfriend was stripped of his or her names as soon as
proven guilty, then thrown over the side tied to ballast stones. Among the Kinswomen, even Reanne
and Alise paled every time they saw the Taraboner woman. But Ispan grew meeker and meeker, eager
to please and full of ingratiating smiles for the two white-haired sisters no matter what it was they did
to her when they carried her away from the others at night. On the other hand, Adeleas and Vandene
grew more and more frustrated. Adeleas told Nynaeve in Elayne’s hearing that the woman spilled out
volumes about old plots of the Black Ajah, those she had not been involved in much more
enthusiastically than those she was, yet even when they pressed her hard—Elayne could not quite
make herself ask how they pressed—and she let slip the names of Darkfriends, most were certainly
dead and none was a sister. Vandene said they were beginning to fear she had taken an Oath—the
capital was audible—against betraying her cohorts. They continued to isolate Ispan as much as
possible and continued with their questions, but it was plain they were feeling their way blindly, now,
and carefully.
And there was Nynaeve, and Lan. Most definitely Nynaeve and Lan, with her near to bursting at
the effort of holding her temper around him, mooning over him when they had to sleep apart—which
was nearly always, the way accommodations divided up—and torn between eager and afraid when
she could sneak him off to a hayloft. It was her own fault for choosing a Sea Folk wedding, in
Elayne’s estimation. The Sea Folk believed in hierarchy as they did in the sea, and they knew a
woman and her husband might be promoted one past the other many times in their lives. Their

marriage rites took that into account. Whoever had the right to command in public, must obey in
private. Lan never took advantage, so Nynaeve said—“not really,” whatever that was supposed to
mean! She always blushed when she said it—but she kept waiting for him to do so, and he just
seemed to grow more and more amused. This amusement, of course, screwed Nynaeve’s temper to a
fever pitch. Nynaeve did erupt, out of all the explosions Elayne had expected. She snapped at anyone
and everyone who got in her way. Except at Lan; with him, she was all honey and cream. And not at
Alise. She came close once or twice, but even Nynaeve could not seem to make herself snap at Alise.
Elayne had hopes, not worries, about the things brought out of the Rahad along with the Bowl of
the Winds. Aviendha helped her search, and so did Nynaeve once or twice, but she was entirely too
slow and ginger about it and showed little skill at finding what they were searching for. They found
no more angreal, yet the collection of ter’angreal grew; once all the rubbish had been thrown away,
objects that used the One Power filled five entire panniers on the packhorses.
Careful as Elayne was, though, her attempts to study them did not go so well. Spirit was the
safest of the Five Powers to use in this—unless, of course, Spirit happened to be what triggered the
thing!—yet at times she had to use other flows, as fine as she could weave. Sometimes her delicate
probing did nothing, but her first touch at the thing that looked like a blacksmith’s puzzle made of
glass left her dizzy and unable to sleep for half the night, and a thread of Fire touching what looked
like a helmet made of fluffy metal feathers gave everyone within twenty paces a blinding headache.
Except for herself. And then there was the crimson rod that felt hot; hot, in a way.
Sitting on the edge of her bed at an inn called The Wild Boar, she examined the smooth rod by
the light of two polished brass lamps. Wrist-thick and a foot long, it looked like stone, but felt firm
rather than hard. She was alone; since the helmet, she had tried to do her studying away from the
others. The heat of the rod made her think of Fire. . . .
Blinking, she opened her eyes and sat up in the bed. Sunlight streamed in at the window. She
was in her shift, and Nynaeve, fully dressed, stood frowning down at her. Aviendha and Birgitte were
watching from beside the door.
“What happened?” Elayne demanded, and Nynaeve shook her head grimly.
“You don’t want to know.” Her lips twitched.
Aviendha’s face gave away nothing. Birgitte’s mouth might have been a little tight, but the
strongest emotion Elayne felt from her was a combination of relief and—hilarity! The woman was
doing her utmost not to roll on the floor laughing!
The worst of it was, no one would tell what had happened. What she had said, or done; she was
sure it was that, by the quickly hidden grins she saw, from Kinswomen and Windfinders as well as
sisters. But no one would tell her! After that, she decided to leave studying the ter’angreal to
somewhere more comfortable than a inn. Somewhere definitely more private!
Nine days after their flight from Ebou Dar, scattered clouds appeared in the sky and a sprinkling
of fat raindrops splashed dust in the road. An intermittent drizzle fell the next day, and the day after, a
deluge kept them huddled in the houses and stables of Forel Market. That night, the rain turned to
sleet, and by morning, thick flurries of snow drifted from a cloud-dark sky. More than halfway to
Caemlyn, Elayne began to wonder whether they could make it in two weeks from where they stood.
With the snow, clothes became a worry. Elayne blamed herself for not thinking of the fact that
everyone might need warm clothes before they reached their destination. Nynaeve blamed herself for
not thinking of it. Merilille thought she was at fault, and Reanne thought she was. They actually stood
in the main street of Forel Market that morning with snow-flakes drifting down on their heads, arguing
over who could claim the blame. Elayne was not sure which of them saw the absurdity first, who was

the first to laugh, but all were laughing as they settled around a table in The White Swan to decide
what to do. A solution turned out to be no laughing matter. Providing one warm coat or cloak for
everyone would take a large bite out of their coin, if so many could be found. Jewelry could be sold
or traded, of course, but no one in Forel Market seemed to be interested in necklaces or bracelets,
however fine.
Aviendha solved that difficulty by producing a small sack that bulged with clear, perfect
gemstones, some quite large. Strangely, the same folk who had said with bare politeness that they had
no use for be-gemmed necklaces went round-eyed at the unset stones rolling about in Aviendha’s
palm. Reanne said they saw one as frippery, the other as wealth, but whatever their reasons, in return
for two rubies of moderate size, one large moonstone, and a small firedrop, the people of Forel
Market were more than willing to provide as many thick woolens as their visitors desired, some of
them hardly worn.
“Very generous of them,” Nynaeve muttered sourly as people began rooting clothes out of their
chests and attics. A steady stream marched into the inn with their arms full. “Those stones could buy
the whole village!” Aviendha shrugged slightly; she would have surrendered a handful of the gems if
Reanne had not intervened.
Merilille shook her head. “We have what they want, but they have what we need. I’m afraid that
means they set the price.” Which was entirely too much like the situation with the Sea Folk. Nynaeve
looked positively ill.
When they were alone, in a hallway of the inn, Elayne asked Aviendha where she had gotten
such a fortune in jewels, and one she seemed eager to be rid of. She expected her near-sister to say
they were her takings from the Stone of Tear, or perhaps Cairhien.
“Rand al’Thor tricked me,” Aviendha muttered sullenly. “I tried to buy my toh from him. I know
that is the least honorable way,” she protested, “but I could see no other. And he stood me on my
head! Why is it, when you reason things out logically, a man always does something completely
illogical and gains the upper hand?”
“Their pretty heads are so fuzzy, a woman can’t expect to follow how they skitter,” Elayne told
her. She did not inquire what toh Aviendha had tried to buy, or how the attempt had ended with her
near-sister possessing a sack full of rich gems. Talking about Rand was hard enough without where
that might lead.
Snow brought more than a need for warm clothing. At midday, with the snow flurries falling
thicker by the minute, Renaile strode down the stairs into the common room, proclaimed that her part
of the bargain had been met, and demanded not only the Bowl of the Winds, but Merilille. The Gray
sister stared in consternation, and so did a great many others. The benches were filled with
Kinswomen taking their turn at the midday meal, and serving men and women ran to serve this third
lot of meals. Renaile did not keep her voice down, and every head in the common room swiveled
toward her.
“You can begin your teaching, now,” Renaile told the wide-eyed Aes Sedai. “Up the ladder with
you to my quarters.” Merilille started to protest, but face suddenly cold, the Windfinder to the
Mistress of the Ships planted fists on her hips. “When I give a command, Merilille Ceandevin,” she
said icily, “I expect every hand on deck to jump. Now jump!”
Merilille did not precisely jump, but she did gather herself and go, with Renaile practically
chivvying her up the stairs from behind. Given her promise, she had no other choice. Reanne’s face
was aghast. Alise and stout Sumeko, still wearing her red belt, watched thoughtfully.
In the days that followed, whether laboring along a snow-covered road on their horses, walking

the streets of a village, or trying to find room for everyone at a farm, Renaile kept Merilille at her
heels except when she told her off to follow another Windfinder. The glow of saidar surrounded the
Gray sister and her escort almost constantly, and Merilille demonstrated weaves unceasingly. The
pale Cairhienin was markedly shorter than any of the dark Sea Folk women, but at first Merilille
managed to stand taller by the sheer force of Aes Sedai dignity. Soon, though, she began to wear a
permanently startled expression. Elayne learned that when they all had beds to sleep in, which they
did not always, Merilille was sharing with Pol, her maid, and the two apprentice Windfinders,
Talaan and Metarra. What that said of Merilille’s status, Elayne was not sure. Clearly, the
Windfinders did not put her on a level with the apprentices. They just expected her to do as she was
told, when she was told, with no delays or equivocations.
Reanne remained appalled at the turn of events, but Alise and Sumeko were not the only ones
among the Kin to watch closely, not the only ones to nod thoughtfully. And suddenly, another problem
came to Elayne’s notice. The Kinswomen saw Ispan made more and more malleable in her captivity,
but she was the prisoner of other Aes Sedai. The Sea Folk were not Aes Sedai, and Merilille not a
prisoner, yet she was starting to jump when Renaile issued a command, or, for that matter, when
Dorile, or Caire, or Caire’s blood-sister Tebreille did. Each of those was Windfinder to a clan
Wavemistress, and none of the others made her hop with such alacrity, but that was enough. More and
more of the Kin slid from horrified gaping to thoughtful observation. Perhaps Aes Sedai were not a
different flesh after all. If Aes Sedai were just women like themselves, why should they subject
themselves once more to the rigors of the Tower, to Aes Sedai authority and Aes Sedai discipline?
Had they not survived very well on their own, some for more years than any of the older sisters were
quite ready to believe? Elayne could practically see the idea forming in their heads.
When she mentioned it to Nynaeve, though, Nynaeve just muttered, “About time some of the
sisters learned what it’s like trying to teach a woman who thinks she knows more than her teacher.
Those who have a chance at a shawl will still want it, and for the rest, I don’t see why they shouldn’t
grow some backbone.” Elayne refrained from mentioning Nynaeve’s complaints about Sumeko, who
had certainly grown backbone; Sumeko had criticized several of Nynaeve’s Healing weaves as
“clumsy,” and Elayne had thought Nynaeve was going to have apoplexy on the spot. “In any case,
there’s no need to tell Egwene about this. If she’s there. Any of it. She has enough on her plate.”
Without doubt, “any of it” referred to Merilille and the Windfinders.
They were in their shifts, seated on their bed on the second floor of The New Plow, with the
twisted-ring dream ter’angreal hanging about their necks, Elayne’s on a simple leather cord,
Nynaeve’s alongside Lan’s heavy signet ring on a narrow golden chain. Aviendha and Birgitte, still
fully dressed, sat on two of their clothing chests. Standing guard, they called it, until she and Nynaeve
returned from the World of Dreams. Both wore their cloaks until they could climb under the blankets.
The New Plow was definitely not new; cracks spidered across the plastered walls, and unfortunate
drafts crept in everywhere.
The room itself was small, and the chests and stacked bundles left room for little beyond the bed
and washstand. Elayne knew she had to present herself properly in Caemlyn, but sometimes she felt
guilty, with her belongings on pack animals when most others had to make do with what they could
carry on their backs. Nynaeve certainly never showed any regrets over her chests. They had been
sixteen days on the road, the full moon outside the narrow window shone on a white blanket of snow
that would make traveling tomorrow slow even if the sky remained clear, and Elayne thought another
week to Caemlyn was an optimistic estimate.
“I have enough sense not to remind her,” she told Nynaeve. “I don’t want my nose snapped off

again.”
That was a mild way of putting it. They had not been in Tel’aran’rhiod since informing Egwene,
the night after leaving the estate, that the Bowl had been used. Reluctantly, they also had told her of
the bargain they had been forced into with the Sea Folk, and found themselves facing the Amyrlin Seat
with the striped stole on her shoulders. Elayne knew it was necessary and right—a Queen’s closest
friend among her subjects knew she was the Queen as well as a friend, had to know—but she had not
enjoyed her friend telling them in a heated voice that they had behaved like witless loobies who might
have brought ruin down on all their heads. Especially when she herself agreed. She had not liked
hearing that the only reason Egwene did not set them both a penance that would curl their hair was
that she could not afford to have them waste the time. Necessary and right, though; when she sat on the
Lion Throne, she would still be Aes Sedai, and subject to the laws and rules and customs of Aes
Sedai. Not for Andor—she would not give her land to the White Tower—but for herself. So,
unpleasant as it had been, she accepted her castigation calmly. Nynaeve had writhed and stammered
with embarrassment, protested and all but pouted, then apologized so profusely that Elayne hardly
believed it was the same woman she knew. Quite rightly, Egwene had remained the Amyrlin, cool in
her displeasure even while giving pardon for their mistakes. At best, tonight could not be pleasant or
comfortable if she was there.
But when they dreamed themselves into the Salidar of Tel’aran’rhiod, into the room in the Little
Tower that had been called the Amyrlin’s Study, she was not there, and the only sign she had visited
since their meeting was some barely visible words roughly scratched on a beetle-riddled wall panel,
as if by an idle hand that did not want to spend the effort to carve deeply.
STAY IN CAEMLYN
And a few feet away:
KEEP SILENT AND BE CAREFUL
Those had been Egwene’s final instructions to them. Go to Caemlyn, and stay there until she
could puzzle out how to keep the Hall from salting all of them down and nailing them into a barrel. A
reminder they had no way to erase.
Embracing saidar, Elayne channeled to leave her own message, the number fifteen seemingly
scratched on the heavy table that had been Egwene’s writing desk. Inverting the weave and tying it off
meant that only someone who ran her fingers across the numerals would realize they were not really
there. Perhaps it would not take fifteen days to reach Caemlyn, but more than a week, she was certain.
Nynaeve strode to the window and peered out both ways, careful not to put her head out through
the open casement. It was night out there as in the waking world, a full moon gleaming on bright
snow, though the air did not feel cold. No one else should be there except them, and if anyone was, it
was someone to avoid. “I hope she isn’t having trouble with her plans,” she muttered.
“She told us not to mention those even to each other, Nynaeve. ‘A secret spoken finds wings.’ ”
That had been another of Lini’s many favorites.
Nynaeve grimaced over her shoulder, then returned to peering down the narrow alley. “It’s
different for you. I tended her as a child, changed her swaddling, smacked her bottom a time or two.
And now I have to leap when she snaps her fingers. It’s hard.”
Elayne could not help herself. She snapped her fingers.
Nynaeve spun so fast that she blurred, her face popeyed with horror. Her dress blurred, too,
from blue riding silks to an Accepted’s banded white to what she referred to as good, stout Two
Rivers wool, dark and thick. When she realized Egwene was not there, had not been listening, she
almost fainted with relief.

When they stepped back to their bodies and woke long enough to tell the others they could come
to bed, Aviendha certainly thought it a good joke, and Birgitte laughed as well. Nynaeve had her
revenge, though. The next morning, she woke Elayne with an icicle. Elayne’s shrieks woke everybody
else in the whole village.
Three days later, the first explosion came.

CHAPTER
21

Answering the Summons

T he great winter tempests called the cemaros continued to roll up out of the Sea of Storms,
harsher than any in memory. Some said this year the cemaros was trying to make up for the
months of delay. Lightning crackled across the skies, enough to make the darkness patchy at
night. Wind lashed the land and rain flailed it, turning all but the hardest roads to rivers of mud.
Sometimes the mud froze after nightfall, but sunrise always brought a thaw, even under a gray
sky, and the ground became bogs once more. Rand was surprised at how much all that hampered
his plans.
The Asha’man he had sent for came quickly, at midmorning the next day, riding out of a gateway
into a driving downpour that obscured the sun so, it might as well have been twilight. Through the
hole in the air, snow fell back in Andor, fat white flakes swirling about thickly and hiding what lay
behind them. Most of the men in the short column were bundled in heavy black cloaks, but the rain
seemed to slip around them and their horses. It was not obvious, yet anyone who noticed would look
twice, if not three times. Keeping dry required only a simple weave, so long as you did not mind
flaunting what you were. But then, the black-and-white disc worked on a crimson circle on the breast
of their cloaks did that. Even half-hidden by the rain, there was a pride about them, an arrogance in
the way they sat their saddles. A defiance. They gloried in what they were.
Their commander, Charl Gedwyn, was a few years older than Rand, of middling height and
wearing the Sword and Dragon, like Torval, on a very well cut, high-collared coat of the best black
silk. His sword was mounted lushly with silver, his silver-worked sword belt fastened with a silver
buckle shaped in a clenched fist. Gedwyn termed himself Tsorovan’m’hael; in the Old Tongue, Storm
Leader, whatever that was supposed to mean. It seemed appropriate to the weather, at least.
Even so, he stood just inside the entrance to Rand’s ornate green tent and scowled out at the
cascading rain. A guard of mounted Companions encircled the tent, no more than thirty paces away,
yet they were barely visible. They might have been statues, ignoring the torrent.
“How do you expect me to find anyone in this?” Gedwyn muttered, glancing back over his
shoulder at Rand. A tick late, he added, “My Lord Dragon.” His eyes were hard and challenging, but
they always were, whether looking at a man or a fencepost. “Rochaid and I brought eight Dedicated
and forty Soldiers, enough to destroy an army or cow ten kings. We might even make an Aes Sedai
blink,” he said wryly. “Burn me, the pair of us could do a fair job alone. Or you could. Why do you
need anyone else?”

“I expect you to obey, Gedwyn,” Rand said coldly. Storm Leader? And Manel Rochaid,
Gedwyn’s second, called himself Baijan’m’hael, Attack Leader. What was Taim up to, creating new
ranks? The important thing was that the man made weapons. The important thing was that the weapons
stayed sane long enough to be used. “And I don’t expect you to waste time questioning my orders.”
“As you command, my Lord Dragon,” Gedwyn muttered. “I’ll send men out immediately.” With
a curt salute, fist to chest, he strode out into the storm. The deluge bent away from him, sheeting down
the small shield he wove around himself. Rand wondered whether the man suspected how close he
had come to dying when he seized saidin without warning.
You must kill him before he kills you, Lews Therin giggled. They will, you know. Dead men
can’t betray anyone. The voice in Rand’s head turned wondering. But sometimes they don’t die. Am
I dead? Are you?
Rand pushed the words down to a fly’s buzzing, just on the edge of notice. Since his
reappearance inside Rand’s head, Lews Therin seldom went silent unless forced. The man seemed
madder than ever most of the time, and usually angrier as well. Stronger sometimes, too. That voice
invaded Rand’s dreams, and when he saw himself in a dream, it was not always himself at all that he
saw. It was not always Lews Therin, either, the face he had come to recognize as Lews Therin’s.
Sometimes it was blurred, yet vaguely familiar, and Lews Therin seemed startled by it, too. That was
an indication how far the man’s madness went. Or maybe his own.
Not yet, Rand thought. I can’t afford to go mad yet.
When, then? Lews Therin whispered before Rand could mute him again.
With the arrival of Gedwyn and the Asha’man, his plan to sweep the Seanchan westward got
under way. Got under way, and crept forward as slowly as a man laboring along one of those mired
roads. He shifted his own camp at once, making no effort to hide his movements. There was little
point to straining for secrecy. Word traveled slowly by pigeon, and far slower by courier, once the
cemaros came, yet he had no doubts he was watched, by the White Tower, by the Forsaken, by anyone
who saw gain or loss in where the Dragon Reborn went and could afford to slip coin to a soldier.
Maybe even by the Seanchan. If he could scout them, why not they him? But not even the Asha’man
knew why he was moving.
While Rand was idly watching men fold his tent onto a high-wheeled cart, Weiramon appeared
on one of his many horses, a prancing white gelding of the finest Tairen bloodstock. The rain had
cleared, though gray clouds still veiled the noonday sun and the air felt as if you could squeeze water
out of it with your hands. The Dragon Banner and the Banner of Light hung limp and sodden on their
tall staffs.
Tairen Defenders had replaced the Companions, and as Weiramon rode through their mounted
ring, he frowned at Rodrivar Tihera, a lean fellow, dark even for a Tairen, with a short beard
trimmed to a very sharp point. A very minor noble who had had to rise through his abilities, Tihera
was punctilious in the extreme. The fat white plumes bobbing on his rimmed helmet added
embellishment to the elaborate bow he gave Weiramon. The High Lord’s frown deepened.
There was no need for the Captain of the Stone to be personally in charge of Rand’s bodyguard,
but he frequently was, just as Marcolin often commanded the Companions himself. An often bitter
rivalry had grown up between Defenders and Companions, centering on who should guard Rand. The
Tairens claimed the right because he had ruled longer in Tear, the Illianers because he was, after all,
King of Illian. Perhaps Weiramon had heard some of the mutters among the Defenders that it was time
Tear had a king of its own, and who better than the man who had taken the Stone? Weiramon more
than agreed with the need, but not with the choice of who should wear the crown. He was not the only

one.
The man smoothed his features as soon as he saw Rand looking, and swung down from his goldtooled saddle to offer a bow that made Tihera’s seem simple. Iron-spined as he was, he could puff up
and strut in his sleep. Though he did grimace slightly at putting his polished boot into the mud. He
wore a rain cape, to keep the mist off his fine clothes, but even that was encrusted with gold
embroidery and had a collar of sapphires. For all of Rand’s coat of deep green silk, with golden bees
climbing the sleeves and lapels, anyone might have been forgiven for thinking the Crown of Swords
belonged on the other’s head, not his.
“My Lord Dragon,” Weiramon intoned. “I cannot express how happy I am to see you guarded by
Tairens, my Lord Dragon. Surely the world would weep if anything untoward happened.” He was too
intelligent to come out and call the Companions untrustworthy. By a hair, he was.
“Sooner or later it would,” Rand said dryly. After a good part of it finished celebrating. “I know
how hard you’d cry, Weiramon.”
The fellow actually preened, stroking the point of his gray-streaked beard. He heard what he
wanted to hear. “Yes, my Lord Dragon, you can be assured of my constancy. Which is why I’m
concerned by the orders your man brought me this morning.” That was Adley; many of the nobles
thought pretending the Asha’man were merely Rand’s servants would somehow make them less
dangerous. “Wise of you to send away most of the Cairhienin. And the Illianers, of course; that goes
without saying. I can even understand why you limit Gueyam and the others.” Weiramon’s boots
squelched in the mud as he stepped nearer, and his voice took on a confiding tone. “I do believe some
of them—I wouldn’t say plotted against you, but I think perhaps their loyalty has not always been
without question. As mine is. Without question.” His voice shifted again, to strong and confident, a
man concerned only with the needs of the one he served. The one who surely would make him the
first King of Tear. “Allow me to bring all of my armsmen, my Lord Dragon. With them, and the
Defenders, I can assure the honor of the Lord of the Morning, and his safety.”
In all of the individual camps across the heath, wagons and carts were being loaded, horses
saddled. Most tents were already down. The High Lady Rosana was riding north, her banner heading
a column large enough to raise havoc among the bandits and at least give the Shaido pause. But not
enough to plant notions in her head, especially not when half were Gueyam’s and Maraconn’s
retainers mixed with Defenders of the Stone. Much the same applied to Spiron Narettin, riding
eastward over the tall ridge with as many Companions and men sworn to others of the Council of
Nine as his own liegemen, not to mention a hundred more tailing behind on foot, some of the fellows
who had surrendered in the woods beyond that ridge the day before. A surprising number had chosen
to follow the Dragon Reborn, but Rand did not trust them enough to leave them together. Tolmeran
was just starting south with the same kind of blend, and others would be marching off as soon as they
had their carts and wagons loaded. Each in a different direction, and none able to trust the men at their
backs far enough for them to do more than follow the orders Rand had given. Bringing peace to Illian
was an important task, yet every last lord and lady regretted being sent away from the Dragon Reborn,
plainly wondering whether it meant they had slipped in his trust. Though a few might have considered
why he chose to keep those he did under his eye. Rosana had certainly looked thoughtful.
“Your concern touches me,” Rand told Weiramon, “but how many bodyguards does one man
need? I’m not off to start a war.” A fine point, perhaps, yet this war was well under way. It had begun
at Falme, if not before. “Get your people ready.”
How many have died for my pride? Lews Therin moaned. How many have died for my
mistakes?

“May I at least ask where we are going?” Weiramon’s question, not quite exasperated, came
right atop the voice in Rand’s head.
“The City,” Rand snapped. He did not know how many had died for his mistakes, but none for
his pride. He was sure of that.
Weiramon opened his mouth, plainly confused as to whether he meant Tear or Illian, or maybe
even Cairhien, but Rand gestured him away with the Dragon Scepter, a sharp stabbing motion that
made the green-and-white tassel swing. He half wished he could stab Lews Therin with it. “I don’t
intend to sit here all day, Weiramon! Go to your men!”
Less than an hour later he took hold of the True Source and prepared to make a gateway for
Traveling. He had to fight the dizziness that gripped him lately whenever he seized or loosed the
Power; he did not quite sway in Tai’daishar’s saddle. What with the molten filth floating on saidin,
the frozen slime, touching the Source came close to emptying his stomach. Seeing double, even for
only a few moments, made weaving flows difficult if not impossible, and he could have told Dashiva
or Flinn or one of the others to do it, but Gedwyn and Rochaid were holding their horses’ reins in
front of a dozen or so black-coated Soldiers, all who had not been out to search. Just standing there
patiently. And watching Rand. Rochaid, no more than a hand shorter than Rand and maybe two years
younger, was also full Asha’man, and his coat, too, was silk. A small smile played on his face, as if
he knew things others did not and was amused. What did he know? About the Seanchan, surely, if not
Rand’s plans for them. What else? Maybe nothing, but Rand was not about to show any weakness in
front of that pair. The dizziness faded quickly, the twinned sight a little more slowly, as it always did,
these last few weeks, and he completed the weave, then, without waiting, dug in his heels and rode
through the opening that unfolded before him.
The City he had meant was Illian, though the gateway opened to the north of that city. Despite
Weiramon’s supposed concerns, he hardly went unprotected and alone. Nearly three thousand men
rode through that tall square hole in the air, into rolling meadowland not far from the broad muddy
road that led down to the Causeway of the Northern Star. Even when every lord had only been
allowed a handful of armsmen—to men accustomed to leading a thousand if not thousands, a hundred
or so were a handful—they added up. Tairens and Cairhienin and Illianers, Defenders of the Stone
under Tihera and Companions under Marcolin, Asha’man heeling Gedwyn. The Asha’man who had
come with him, anyway. Dashiva and Flinn and the rest kept their horses close behind Rand. All but
Narishma. Narishma had not come back yet. The man knew where to find him, but Rand did not like
it.
Each kind kept to themselves as much as possible. Gueyam and Maraconn and Aracome rode
with Weiramon, all eyeing Rand more than where they were going, and Gregorin Panar with three
others of the Council of Nine, leaning in their saddles to speak softly and uneasily among themselves.
Semaradrid, with a knot of tight-faced Cairhienin lords behind him, watched Rand almost as closely
as the Tairens did. Rand had chosen those who came with him as carefully as those he sent away, not
always for the reasons others might have used.
Had there been any onlookers, it would have been a brave display, with all their bright banners
and pennants, and small con rising from some of the Cairhienin’s backs. Bright and brave and very
dangerous. Some had plotted against him, and he had learned that Semaradrid’s House Maravin had
old alliances with House Riatin, which stood in open rebellion against him in Cairhien. Semaradrid
did not deny the connection, but he had not mentioned it before Rand heard, either. The Council of
Nine were just too new to him to risk leaving them all behind. And Weiramon was a fool. Left to his
own devices, he might well try to gain the Lord Dragon’s favor by marching an army against the

Seanchan, or Murandy, or the Light alone knew who or where. Too stupid to leave behind, too
powerful to shove aside, so he rode with Rand and thought himself honored. It was almost a pity he
was not stupid enough to do something that would get him executed.
Behind came the servants and carts—no one understood why Rand had sent all of the wagons
with the others, and he was not about to explain; who owned the next pair of ears that would hear?—
and then the long strings of spare mounts led by horse handlers, and straggling files of men in battered
breastplates that did not quite fit or leather jerkins sewn with rusty steel discs, carrying bows or
crossbows or spears, and even a few pikes; more of the fellows who had obeyed “Lord Brend’s”
summons and decided against going home unarmed. Their leader was the runny-nosed man Rand had
spoken to on the edge of the woods, Eagan Padros by name and much brighter than he looked. It was
difficult for a commoner to rise very far, most places, but Rand had marked Padros out. The fellow
gathered his men off to one side, but the whole lot of them milled about, elbowing one another aside
for a better view southward.
The Causeway of the Northern Star stretched arrow-straight through the miles of brown marsh
that surrounded Illian, a wide road of hard-packed dirt broken by flat stone bridges. A wind from the
south carried sea salt and a hint of tanneries. Illian was a sprawling city, easily as large as Caemlyn
or Cairhien. Brightly colored roof tiles and hundreds of thrusting towers, gleaming in the sun, were
just visible across that sea of grass where long-legged cranes waded and flocks of white birds flew
low uttering shrill cries. Illian had never needed walls. Not that walls would have done the City any
good against him.
There was considerable disappointment that he did not mean to enter Illian, though no one spoke
a complaint, at least not where he could hear. Still, there were plenty of glum faces and sour mutters
as hasty camps began going up. Like most of the great cities, Illian had a name for exotic mystery,
free-handed tapsters, and willing women. At least among men who had never been there, even when it
was their own capital. Ignorance always inflated a city’s reputation for such things. As it was, only
Morr galloped off across the causeway. Men straightened from hammering tent pegs or setting picket
lines for the horses, and followed him with jealous eyes. Nobles watched curiously, while trying to
pretend they were not.
The Asha’man with Gedwyn paid Morr no mind as they made their own camp, which consisted
of a pitch-black tent for Gedwyn and Rochaid and a space where damp brown grass and mud were
squeezed flat and dry, for the rest to sleep wrapped in their cloaks. That was done with the Power, of
course; they did everything with the Power, not even bothering to build cook fires. A few in the other
camps stared at them, wide-eyed, as the tent seemed to spring up of its own accord and hampers
floated away from packsaddles, but most looked anywhere else at all once they realized what was
going on. Two or three of the black-coated Soldiers appeared to be talking to themselves.
Flinn and the others did not join Gedwyn’s lot—they had a pair of tents that went up not far from
Rand’s—but Dashiva wandered over to where the “Storm Leader” and the “Attack Leader” were
standing at their ease, and occasionally issuing a sharp order. A few words, and he wandered back
shaking his head and muttering angrily under his breath. Gedwyn and Rochaid were not a friendly
pair. As well they were not.
Rand took to his tent as soon as it was pitched, and sprawled fully clothed on his cot, staring at
the sloped ceiling. There were bees embroidered on the inside as well, on a false roof made of silk.
Hopwil brought a steaming pewter mug of mulled wine—Rand had left his servants behind—but the
wine grew cold on his writing table. His mind worked feverishly. Two or three more days, and the
Seanchan would have been dealt a blow that knocked them on their heels. Then it was back to

Cairhien to see how negotiations with the Sea Folk had gone, to learn what Cadsuane was after—he
owed her a debt, but she was after something!—maybe to put a final end to what remained of the
rebellion there. Had Caraline Damodred and Darlin Sisnera slipped away in the confusion? The High
Lord Darlin in his hands might finish the rebellion in Tear, as well. Andor. If Mat and Elayne were in
Murandy, the way it appeared, it would be weeks more at best before Elayne could claim the Lion
Throne. Once that happened, he would have to stay clear of Caemlyn. But he had to talk to Nynaeve.
Could he cleanse saidin? It might work. It might destroy the world, too. Lews Therin gibbered at him
in stark terror. Light, where was Narishma?
A cemaros storm swept in, all the fiercer this near the sea. Rain beat his tent like a drum.
Lightning flashes filled the entrance with blue-white light, and thunder rumbled, the sound like
mountains tumbling across the land.
Out of that, Narishma stepped into the tent, dripping wet, dark hair plastered to his head. His
orders had been to avoid notice at all cost. No flaunting for him. His sodden coat was plain brown,
and his dark hair was tied back, not braided. Even without bells, near waist-length hair on a man
attracted eyes. He wore a scowl, too, and under his arm he carried a cylindrical bundle tied with
cord, fatter than a man’s leg, like a small carpet.
Springing from the cot, Rand snatched the bundle before Narishma could proffer it. “Did anyone
see you?” he demanded. “What took you so long? I expected you last night!”
“It took a while to figure out what I had to do,” Narishma replied in a flat voice. “You didn’t tell
me everything. You nearly killed me.”
That was ridiculous. Rand had told him everything he needed to know. He was sure of it. There
was no point to trusting the man as far as he had, only to have him die and ruin everything. Carefully
he tucked the bundle beneath his cot. His hands trembled with the urge to strip the wrappings away, to
make sure they held what Narishma had been sent for. The man would not have dared return if they
did not. “Get yourself into a proper coat before you join the others,” he said. “And Narishma. . . .
Rand straightened, fixing the other man with a steady gaze. “You tell anyone about this, and I will kill
you.”
Kill the whole world, Lews Therin laughed, a moan of derision. Of despair. I killed the world,
and you can, too, if you try hard.
Narishma struck himself hard on the chest with his fist. “As you command, my Lord Dragon,” he
said sourly.
Bright and early the next morning, a thousand men of the Legion of the Dragon marched out of
Illian, across the Causeway of the Northern Star, stepping to the steady beat of drums. Well, it was
early, anyway. Thick gray clouds roiled across the sky, and a stiff sea breeze sharp with salt whipped
cloaks and banners, muttering of another storm on the way. The Legion attracted a good bit of
attention from the armsmen already in the camp, with their blue-painted Andoran helmets and their
long blue coats worked on the chest with a red-and-gold Dragon. A blue pennant bearing the Dragon
and a number marked each of the five companies. The Legionmen were different in many ways. For
instance, they wore breastplates, but beneath their coats, so as not to hide the Dragons—the same
reason the coats buttoned up one side—and every man carried a short-sword at his hip and a steelarmed crossbow, every one shouldered exactly the same as every other. The officers walked, each
with a tall red plume on his helmet, just ahead of drum and pennant. The only horses were Morr’s
mouse-colored gelding, at their head, and pack animals at the rear.
“Foot,” Weiramon muttered, slapping his reins on a gauntleted hand. “Burn my soul, they’re no
good, foot. They’ll scatter at the first charge. Before.” The first of the column strode off the causeway.

They had helped take Illian, and they had not scattered.
Semaradrid shook his head. “No pikes,” he muttered. “I have seen well-led foot hold, with
pikes, but without. . . .” He made a sound of disgust in his throat.
Gregorin Panar, the third man sitting his saddle near Rand to watch the new arrivals, said
nothing. Perhaps he had no prejudice against infantry—though if he did not, he would be one of only a
handful of noblemen Rand had met without it—but he tried hard not to frown and almost succeeded.
Everyone knew by now that the men with the Dragon on their chests bore arms because they had
chosen to follow Rand, chosen to follow the Dragon Reborn, for no other reason than that they wanted
to. The Illianer had to be wondering where they were going that Rand wanted the Legion and the
Council of Nine was not trusted to know. For that matter, Semaradrid eyed Rand sideways. Only
Weiramon was too stupid to think.
Rand turned Tai’daishar away. Narishma’s package had been rewrapped, into a thinner bundle,
and tied beneath his left stirrup leather. “Strike the camp; we’re moving,” he told the three nobles.
This time, he let Dashiva weave the gateway to take them all away. The plain-faced fellow
frowned at him and mumbled to himself—Dashiva actually seemed affronted, for some reason!—and
Gedwyn and Rochaid, their horses shoulder-by-shoulder, watched with sardonic smiles as the silvery
slash of light rotated into a hole in nothing. Watched Rand more than Dashiva. Well, let them watch.
How often could he seize saidin and risk falling dizzily on his face before he really did fall? It could
not be where they could see.
This time, the gateway took them to a wide road carved through the low, brushy foothills of
mountains to the west. The Nemarellin Mountains. Not the equals of the Mountain of Mist, and not a
patch on the Spine of the World, but they rose dark and severe against the sky, sharp peaks that
walled the west coast of Illian. Beyond them lay Kabal Deep, and beyond that. . . .
Men began to recognize the peaks soon enough. Gregorin Panar took one look around and
nodded in sudden satisfaction. The other three Councilors and Marcolin reined close to him to talk
while horsemen were still pouring through the gateway. Semaradrid required only a bit longer to
puzzle it out, and Tihera, and they also looked as if they understood now.
The Silver Road ran from the City to Lugard, and carried all of the inland trade for the west.
There was a Gold Road, too, that led to Far Madding. Roads and names alike dated from before there
had been an Illian. Centuries of wagon wheels, hooves and boots had beaten them hard, and the
cemaros could only skim them with mud. They were among the few reliable highways in Illian for
moving large groups of men in winter. Everyone knew about the Seanchan in Ebou Dar by this time,
though a good many of the tales Rand had heard among the armsmen made the invaders seem
Trollocs’ meaner cousins. If the Seanchan intended to strike into Illian, the Silver Road was a good
place to gather for defense.
Semaradrid and the others thought they knew what he planned: he must have learned that the
Seanchan were coming, and the Asha’man were there to destroy them when they did. Given the
stories about the Seanchan, no one seemed too upset that that left little for them to do. Of course,
Weiramon had to have it explained to him finally, by Tihera, and he was upset, though he tried to
mask it behind a grand speech about the wisdom of the Lord Dragon and the military genius of the
Lord of the Morning, along with how he, personally, would lead the first charge against these
Seanchan. A pure bull-goose fool. With luck, anyone else who learned of a gathering on the Silver
Road would at least not be too much brighter than Semaradrid or Gregorin. With luck, no one who
mattered would learn before it was too late.
Settling in to wait, Rand thought it would only be another day or so, but as the days stretched out,

he began to wonder whether he might be nearly as big a fool as Weiramon.
Most of the Asha’man were out searching across Illian and Tear and the Plains of Maredo for
the rest of those Rand wanted. Searching through the cemaros. Gateways and Traveling were all very
well, but even Asha’man took time to find who they sought when downpours hid anything fifty paces
away and quagmires dragged rumor to a near halt. Searching Asha’man passed within a mile of their
quarry in ignorance, and turned only to learn the men had moved on again. Some had farther to go,
seeking people not necessarily eager to be found. Days passed before the first brought news.
The High Lord Sunamon joined Weiramon, a fat man with an unctuous manner—toward Rand, at
least. Smooth in his fine silk coat, always smiling, he was voluble in his declarations of loyalty, but
he had plotted against Rand so long that he probably did so in his sleep. The High Lord Torean came,
with his lumpy farmer’s face and his vast wealth, stammering about the honor of riding once more at
the Lord Dragon’s side. Gold concerned Torean more than anything else, except possibly the
privileges Rand had taken away from the nobles in Tear. He seemed particularly dismayed to learn
there were no serving girls in the camp, and not so much as a village nearby where compliant
farmgirls might be found. Torean had schemed against Rand every bit as often as Sunamon. Maybe
even more than Gueyam, or Maraconn, or Aracome.
There were others. There was Bertome Saighan, a short, ruggedly handsome man with the front
of his head shaved. He supposedly did not mourn the death of his cousin Colavaere too greatly, both
because that made him the new High Seat of House Saighan and because rumor said Rand had
executed her. Or murdered her. Bertome bowed and smiled, and his smile never reached his dark
eyes. Some said he had been very fond of his cousin. Ailil Riatin came, a slim dignified woman with
big dark eyes, not young but quite pretty, protesting that she had a Lance-captain to lead her armsmen
and no desire to take the field in person. Protesting her loyalty for the Lord Dragon, too. But her
brother Toram claimed the throne Rand meant for Elayne, and it was whispered that she would do
anything for Toram, anything at all. Even join with his enemies; to hamper or to spy or both, of
course. Dalthanes Annallin came, and Amondrid Osiellin, and Doressin Chuliandred, lords who had
supported Colavaere’s seizure of the Sun Throne when they thought Rand would never return to
Cairhien.
Cairhienin and Tairen, they were brought in one by one, with fifty retainers, or at most a
hundred. Men and women he trusted even less than he did Gregorin or Semaradrid. Most were men,
not because he thought the women any less dangerous—he was not that big a fool; a woman would
kill you twice as fast as a man, and usually for half the reason!—but because he could not bring
himself to take any woman except the most dangerous, where he was going. Ailil could smile warmly
while she calculated where to plant the knife in your ribs. Anaiyella, a willowy simpering High Lady
who gave a fair imitation of a beautiful goosebrain, had returned to Tear from Cairhien and openly
begun talking of herself for the as-yet-nonexistent throne of Tear. Perhaps she was a fool, but she had
managed to gain a great deal of support, both among nobles and in the streets.
So he gathered them in, all the folk who had been too long out from under his eye. He could not
watch all of them all the time, but he could not afford to let them forget that he did watch sometimes.
He gathered them, and he waited. For two days. Gnashing his teeth, he waited. Five days. Eight.
Rain was beating a diminishing drum on his tent when the last man he was waiting for finally
arrived.
Shaking a small torrent from his oiled-cloth cape, Davram Bashere blew out his thick, graystreaked mustaches in disgust and tossed the cape over a barrel chair. A short man with a great
hooked beak of a nose, he seemed larger than he was. Not because he strutted, but because he

assumed that he was as tall as any man present, and other men took him so. Wise men did. The wolfheaded ivory baton of the Marshal-General of Saldaea, tucked carelessly behind his sword belt, had
been earned on scores of battlefields and at as many council tables. He was one of the very few men
Rand would trust with his life.
“I know you don’t like explaining,” Bashere muttered, “but I could use a little illumination.”
Adjusting his serpentine sword, he sprawled in another chair and flung a leg over the arm of it. He
always seemed at his ease, but he could uncoil faster than a whip. “That Asha’man fellow wouldn’t
say more than you needed me yesterday, yet he said not to bring more than a thousand men. I only had
half that with me, but I brought them. It can’t be a battle. Half the sigils I saw out there belong to men
who’d bite their tongues if they saw a fellow behind you with a knife, and most of the rest to men
who’d try to hold your attention. If they hadn’t paid the knife man in the first place.”
Seated behind his writing table in his shirtsleeves, Rand wearily pressed the heels of his palms
against his eyes. With Boreane Carivin left behind, the lamp wicks needed proper trimming, and a
faint haze of smoke hung in the air. Besides, he had been awake most of the night poring over the
maps scattered across the table. Maps of southern Altara. No two agreed on very much.
“If you’re going to fight a battle,” he told Bashere, “who better to pay the butcher’s bill than men
who want you dead? Anyway, it isn’t soldiers who’ll win this battle. All they have to do is keep
anybody from sneaking up on the Asha’man. What do you think of that?”
Bashere snorted so hard that his heavy mustaches stirred. “I think it’s a deadly stew, is what I
think. Somebody’s going to choke to death on it. The Light send it isn’t us.” And then he laughed as if
that were a fine joke.
Lews Therin laughed, too.

CHAPTER
22

Gathering Clouds

U nder a steady drizzle Rand’s small army formed columns across the low folded hills facing
the Nemarellin peaks, dark and sharp against the western sky. There was no real need to face the
direction you intended to Travel, but it always felt askew to Rand otherwise. Despite the rain,
rapidly thinning gray clouds let through startlingly bright sunshine. Or maybe the day only
seemed bright, after all the recent gloom.
Four of the columns were headed by Bashere’s Saldaeans, bandy-legged unarmored men in short
coats standing patiently beside their mounts beneath a small forest of shining lance heads, the other
five by blue-coated men with the Dragon on their chests, commanded by a short stocky fellow named
Jak Masond. When Masond moved, it was always with surprising quickness, but he was utterly still
now, feet planted astride and hands folded behind his back. His men were in place, and so were the
Defenders and Companions, grumpy about being behind infantry. It was the nobles and their folk,
mainly, who milled about as if unsure where to go. Thick mud sucked at hooves and boots, and mired
cart wheels; shouted curses rose. It took time to line up nearly six thousand soaked men, getting wetter
by the minute. And that was not counting the supply carts, and the remounts.
Rand had donned his finest, so he would stand out at a glance. A lick with the Power had
polished the Dragon Scepter’s spearhead to mirror brightness, and another had burnished the Crown
of Swords so the gold gleamed. The gilded Dragon buckle of his sword belt caught the light, and so
did the thread-of-gold embroidery that covered his blue silk coat. For a moment, he regretted giving
away the gems that once had decked his sword’s hilt and scabbard. The dark boarhide was
serviceable, but any armsman could have worn that. Let men know who he was. Let the Seanchan
know who had come to destroy them.
Sitting Tai’daishar on a broad flat, he impatiently watched the nobles roil about on the hills. A
little way off on the flat, Gedwyn and Rochaid sat their saddles in front of their men, all formed into a
precise box, Dedicated in the front rank, Soldiers lined up behind. They looked ready to parade. As
many had gray hair or nearly none as were young—several were as young as Hopwil or Morr—but
every one was strong enough to make a gateway. That had been a requirement. Flinn and Dashiva
waited behind Rand in a casual cluster with Adley and Morr, Hopwil and Narishma. And a rigid pair
of mounted bannermen, one Tairen and one Cairhienin, their breastplates and helmets and even their

steel-backed gauntlets buffed and polished till they shone. The crimson Banner of Light and the long
white Dragon Banner hung limp and dripping. Rand had assumed the Power in his tent, where his
momentary stagger would not be seen, and the sparse rain failed by an inch to touch him or his horse.
The taint on saidin felt especially heavy today, a thick foul oil that oozed into his pores and
stained his bones deep. Stained his soul. He had thought himself accustomed to the vileness, after a
fashion, yet today it was nauseating, stronger than the frozen fire and molten cold of saidin itself. He
held on to the Source as often as possible now, accepting the vileness to avoid the new sickness of
seizing it. It could be deadly, if he let sickness distract him from that struggle. Maybe it was
connected to the dizzy spells, somehow. Light, he could not go mad yet, and he could not die. Not yet.
There was too much still to be done.
He pressed his left leg against Tai’daishar’s flank just to feel the long bundle strapped between
stirrup leather and scarlet saddle cloth. Every time he did that, something wriggled across the outside
of the Void. Anticipation, and maybe a touch of fear. Well trained, the gelding started to turn left, and
Rand had to rein him back. When would the nobles sort themselves out? He ground his teeth in
impatience.
He could remember as a boy hearing men laugh that when rain fell in sunshine the Dark One was
beating Semirhage. Some of that laughter had been uneasy, though, and scrawny old Cenn Buie would
always snarl that Semirhage would be smarting and angry after that, and come for small boys who did
not keep out of their elders’ way. That had been enough to send Rand running, when he was little. He
wished Semirhage would come for him now, right that instant. He would make her weep.
Nothing makes Semirhage weep, Lews Therin muttered. She gives tears to others, but she has
none herself.
Rand laughed softly. If she came today, he would make her weep. Her and the rest of the
Forsaken together, if they came today. Most assuredly he would make the Seanchan weep.
Not everyone was pleased with the orders he had given. Sunamon’s oily smile vanished when he
thought Rand did not see. Torean had a flask in his saddlebags, no doubt brandy, or maybe several
flasks, because he drank steadily and never appeared to run dry. Semaradrid and Marcolin and Tihera
each appeared in front of Rand to protest the numbers with somber faces. A few years before, close
on six thousand men would have been army enough for any war, but they had seen armies in the tens
of thousands, now, hundreds of thousands, as in Artur Hawkwing’s day, and to go against the
Seanchan, they wanted far more. He sent them away disgruntled. They did not understand that fiftyodd Asha’man were as big a hammer as anyone could wish for. Rand wondered what they would
have said had he told them he was hammer enough by himself. He had considered doing this by
himself. It might come to that yet.
Weiramon came; he did not like having to take orders from Bashere, or the fact that they were
going into mountains—very hard to mount a decent charge in mountains—or several other things—
Rand was certain there were at least several more—that Rand did not let him utter.
“The Saldaean seems to believe I should ride on the right flank,” Weiramon muttered
disparagingly. He twisted his shoulders as though the right flank were a great insult, for some reason.
“And the foot, my Lord Dragon. Really, I think—”
“I think you should get your men ready,” Rand said coldly. Part of the chill was the effect of
floating in emotionless emptiness. “Or you won’t be on any flank.” He meant that he would leave the
man behind if he was not ready in time. Surely such a fool could not make much trouble left in this
remote spot with only a few armsmen. Rand would be back before he could ride to anything larger
than a village.

Blood drained from Weiramon’s face, though. “As my Lord Dragon commands,” he said, briskly
for him, and was whirling his horse away before the words were well out of his mouth. His mount
was a tall deep-chested bay, today.
The pale Lady Ailil reined to a stop in front of Rand, accompanied by the High Lady Anaiyella,
a strange pair to be in company, and not just because their nations hated one another. Ailil was tall for
a Cairhienin woman, if only for a Cairhienin, and everything about her was dignity and precision,
from the arch of her eyebrow to the turn of her red-gloved wrist to the way her pearl-collared rain
cape lay spread across the rump of her smoke-gray mare. Unlike Semaradrid or Marcolin, Weiramon
or Tihera, she did not so much as blink at the sight of raindrops sliding down nothing around him.
Anaiyella did blink. And gasp. And titter behind her hand. Anaiyella was willowy and darkly
beautiful, her rain cape collared with rubies and embroidered with gold besides, but there any
resemblance to Ailil ended. Anaiyella was all mincing elegance and simpers. When she bowed, her
white gelding did, too, bending its forelegs. The prancing animal was showy, but Rand suspected it
had no bottom. Like its mistress.
“My Lord Dragon,” Ailil said, “I must make one more protest against my inclusion in this . . .
expedition.” Her voice was coolly neutral, if not exactly unfriendly. “I will send my retainers where
you command and when, but I have no desire at all to be in the thick of a battle.”
“Oh, no,” Anaiyella added, with a delicate shudder. Even her tone simpered! “Nasty things,
battles. So my Master of the Horse says. Surely you won’t really make us go, my Lord Dragon?
We’ve heard you have a particular care for women. Haven’t we, Ailil?”
Rand was so astonished that the Void collapsed, and saidin vanished. Raindrops began to trickle
through his hair and seep through his coat, but for a moment, clutching his saddle’s high pommel to
hold himself upright, seeing four women instead of two, he was too stunned to notice. How much did
they know? They had heard? How many people knew? How did anyone know? Light, rumor had him
killing Morgase, Elayne, Colavaere, a hundred women probably, and each in a worse way than the
last! He swallowed against the urge to sick up. That was only partly saidin’s fault. Burn me, how
many spies are there watching me? The thought was a growl.
The dead watch, Lews Therin whispered. The dead never close their eyes. Rand shivered.
“I do try to be careful of women,” he told them when he could speak. Faster than a man, and for
half the reason. “That’s why I want to keep you close the next few days. But if you really dislike the
idea so much, I could tell off one of the Asha’man. You’d be safe at the Black Tower.” Anaiyella
squeaked prettily, but her face went gray.
“Thank you, no,” Ailil said after a moment, absolutely calm. “I suppose I had best confer with
my lance-captain about what to expect.” But she paused in turning her mare away, and regarded Rand
with a sidelong look. “My brother Toram is . . . impetuous, my Lord Dragon. Even rash. I am not.”
Anaiyella smiled much too sweetly at Rand, and actually wriggled slightly before following, but
once she faced away from him, she dug in her heels and worked her jewel-handled quirt, quickly
passing the other woman. That white gelding showed a surprising turn of speed.
At last all was ready, the columns formed, snaking back over the low hills.
“Begin,” Rand told Gedwyn, who wheeled his horse and began barking orders to his men. The
eight Dedicated rode forward and dismounted on the ground they had memorized, facing the
mountains. One of them looked familiar, a grizzled fellow whose pointed Tairen beard appeared odd
on his wrinkled countryman’s face. Eight vertical lines of sharp blue light turned and became
openings that showed slightly different views of a long, sparsely wooded mountain valley rising to a
steep pass. In Altara. In the Venir Mountains.

Kill them, Lews Therin wept pleadingly. They’re too dangerous to live! Without thought, Rand
suppressed the voice. Another man channeling often brought that reaction from Lews Therin, or even
a man who could. He no longer wondered why.
Rand muttered a command, and Flinn blinked in surprise before hurrying to join the line and
weave a ninth gateway. None was as large as Rand could make, but any would pass a cart, if closely.
He had intended to do that himself, but he did not want to chance seizing saidin again in front of
everyone. He noticed Gedwyn and Rochaid watching him, wearing identical knowing smiles. And
Dashiva as well, frowning, lips moving as he talked to himself. Was it his imagination, or was
Narishma eyeing him askance too? And Adley? Morr?
Rand shivered before he could stop himself. Mistrust of Gedwyn and Rochaid was simple sense,
but was he coming down with what Nynaeve had called the dreads? A kind of madness, a crippling
dark suspicion of everyone and everything? There had been a Coplin, Benly, who thought everybody
was scheming against him. He had starved to death when Rand was a boy, refusing to eat for fear of
poison.
Ducking low on Tai’daishar’s neck, Rand heeled the gelding through the largest gateway.
Flinn’s, as it happened, but he would have ridden through one made by Gedwyn right then. He was the
first onto Altaran soil.
The others followed quickly, the Asha’man first of all. Dashiva stared in Rand’s direction,
frowning, and Narishma, too, but Gedwyn immediately began directing his Soldiers. One by one, they
rushed forward, opened a gateway and darted through, dragging their mounts behind them. Ahead up
the valley, bright flashes of light told of gateways opening and closing. The Asha’man could Travel
short distances without first memorizing the ground they left from, and cover ground far faster than
riding. In short order, only Gedwyn and Rochaid remained, aside from the Dedicated holding the
gateways. The others would be fanning out westward, searching for Seanchan. The Saldaeans were
through from Illian, and mounting. Legionmen spread into the trees at a trot, crossbows held ready. In
this country, they could move as fast afoot as men on horseback.
As the rest of the army began emerging, Rand rode up the valley in the direction the Asha’man
had gone. Mountains rose high behind him, a wall fronting the Deep, but west the peaks ran almost to
Ebou Dar. He quickened the gelding’s pace to a canter.
Bashere caught him before he reached the pass. The man’s bay was small—most of the
Saldaeans rode small horses—but quick. “No Seanchan here, it seems,” he said almost idly, stroking
his mustaches with a knuckle. “But there could have been. Tenobia’s likely to have my head on a pike
soon enough for following a live Dragon Reborn, much more a dead one.”
Rand scowled. Maybe he could take Flinn, to watch his back, and Narishma, and. . . . Flinn had
saved his life; the man had to be true. Men could change, though. And Narishma? Even after . . . ? He
felt cold at the risk he had taken. Not the dreads. Narishma had proved true, but it still had been a
mad risk. As mad as running from stares he was not even sure were real, running to where he had no
notion what was waiting. Bashere was right, but Rand did not want to talk about it further.
The slopes leading up into the pass were bare stone and boulders of all sizes, but among the
natural stone lay weathered pieces of what must have once been a huge statue. Some were just
recognizable as worked stone, others more so. A beringed hand nearly big as his chest, gripping a
sword hilt with a broken stub of blade wider than his hand. A great head, a woman with cracks across
her face and a crown that seemed to be made of up-thrusting daggers, some still whole.
“Who do you think she was?” he asked. A queen, of course. Even if merchants or scholars had
worn crowns in some distant time, only rulers and generals earned statues.

Bashere twisted in his saddle to study the head before speaking. “A Queen of Shiota, I’ll
wager,” he said finally. “Not older. I saw a statue made in Eharon once, and it was so worn you
couldn’t say whether it was man or woman. A conqueror, or they wouldn’t have shown her with a
sword. And I seem to recall Shiota gave a crown like that to rulers who expanded the borders. Maybe
they called it the Crown of Swords, eh? A Brown sister might be able to tell you more.”
“It isn’t important,” Rand told him irritably. They did look like swords.
Bashere went on anyway, graying eyebrows lowered, gravely serious. “I expect thousands
cheered her, called her the hope of Shiota, maybe even believed she was. In her time, she might have
been as feared and respected as Artur Hawkwing was later, but now even the Brown sisters may not
know her name. When you die, people begin to forget, who you were and what you did, or tried to do.
Everybody dies eventually, and everybody is forgotten, eventually, but there’s no bloody point dying
before your time comes.”
“I don’t intend to,” Rand said sharply. He knew where he was meant to die, if not when. He
thought he did.
The corner of his eye caught motion, back down where bare stone gave way to brush and a few
small trees. Fifty paces away, a man stepped into the open and raised a bow, smoothly drawing
fletchings to cheek. Everything seemed to happen at once.
Snarling, Rand hauled Tai’daishar around, watching the archer adjust to follow. He seized
saidin and sweet life and filth poured into him together. His head spun. There were two archers. Bile
rose in his throat as he fought wild, uncontrolled surges of the Power that tried to sear him to the bone
and freeze his flesh solid. He could not control them; it was all he could do to stay alive.
Desperately, he fought to clear his sight, to be able to see well enough to weave the flows he could
barely form, with nausea flooding him as strongly as the Power. He thought he heard Bashere shout.
Two archers loosed.
Rand should have died. At that range, a boy could have hit his target. Maybe being ta’veren
saved him. As the archer let fly, a covey of gray-winged quail burst up almost at his feet uttering
piercing whistles. Not enough to throw off an experienced man, and indeed, the fellow only flinched a
hair. Rand felt the wind of the arrow’s passage against his cheek.
Fireballs the size of fists suddenly struck the archer. He screamed as his arm spun away, hand
still gripping the bow. Another took his left leg at the knee, and he fell shrieking.
Leaning out of his saddle, Rand vomited onto the ground. His stomach tried to heave up every
meal he had ever eaten. The Void and saidin left with a sickening wrench. It was nearly more than he
could manage not to fall.
When he could sit upright again, he took the white linen handkerchief Bashere silently offered,
and wiped his mouth. The Saldaean frowned with concern, as well he might. Rand’s stomach wanted
to find more to spew out. He thought his face must be pale. He drew a deep breath. Losing saidin that
way could kill you. But he could still sense the Source; at least saidin had not burned him out. At
least he could see properly; there was only one Davram Bashere. But the illness seemed a little
worse each time he seized saidin.
“Let’s see if there’s enough left of this fellow to talk,” he told Bashere. There was not.
Rochaid was on his knees, calmly searching through the corpse’s torn, bloodstained coat.
Besides his missing arm and leg, the dead man had a blackened hole as big as his head all the way
through his chest. It was Eagan Padros; his sightless eyes stared at the sky in surprise. Gedwyn
ignored the body at his feet, studying Rand instead, as cold as Rochaid. Both men held saidin.
Surprisingly, Lews Therin only moaned.

In a clatter of hooves on stone, Flinn and Narishma came galloping up the rise, followed by
nearly a hundred Saldaeans. As they came close, Rand could feel the Power in the grizzled old man
and the younger, maybe as much as they could hold. They had both leaped up in strength since
Dumai’s Wells. That was the way of it with men; women seemed to gain smoothly, but men suddenly
jumped. Flinn was stronger than Gedwyn or Rochaid either one, and Narishma not far behind. For the
time being; there was no way to know how it would end. None came close to matching Rand, though.
Not yet, anyway. There was no way to tell what time would bring. Not the dreads.
“It seems it’s well we decided to follow you, my Lord Dragon.” Gedwyn’s voice assumed
concern, just shy of mocking. “Are you suffering from a tender stomach this morning?”
Rand just shook his head. He could not take his eyes from Padros’ face. Why? Because he had
conquered Illian? Because the man had been loyal to “Lord Brend”?
With a loud exclamation, Rochaid ripped a wash-leather pouch from Padros’ coat pocket and
upended it. Bright golden coins spilled onto the stony ground, bouncing and clinking. “Thirty
crowns,” he growled. “Tar Valon crowns. No doubt who paid him.” He snatched a coin and tossed it
up for Rand, but Rand made no effort to catch it, and it glanced off his arm.
“There’s plenty of Tar Valon coin to be found,” Bashere said calmly. “Half the men in this
valley have a few in their pockets. I do, myself” Gedwyn and Rochaid swiveled to look at him.
Bashere smiled behind his thick mustaches, or at least showed teeth, but some of the Saldaeans
shifted uneasily in their saddles and fingered belt pouches.
Up where the pass leveled off for a bit between steep mountain slopes, a slash of light rotated
into a gateway, and a top-knotted Shienaran in a plain black coat trotted through, pulling his horse
behind him. It appeared the first Seanchan had been found, and not too far away if the man was back
so quickly.
“Time to move,” Rand told Bashere. The man nodded, but he did not stir. Instead, he studied the
two Asha’man standing near Padros. They ignored him.
“What do we do with him?” Gedwyn demanded, gesturing to the corpse. “We ought to send him
back to the witches, at least.”
“Leave him,” Rand replied.
Are you ready to kill now? Lews Therin asked. He did not sound insane at all.
Not yet, Rand thought. Soon.
Digging his heels into Tai’daishar’s flanks, he galloped back down toward his army. Dashiva
and Flinn followed closely, and Bashere and the hundred Saldaeans. They were all looking around as
if they expected another attempt on his life. To the east, black clouds were building among the peaks,
another cemaros storm. Soon.
The hilltop camp was well laid out, with a meandering stream close by for water and good lines
of sight to the likeliest ways into the long mountain meadow. Assid Bakuun did not feel pride in the
camp. During thirty years in the Ever Victorious Army, he had made hundreds of camps; he would as
soon have felt pride in walking across a room without falling down. Nor did he feel pride in where
he was. Thirty years serving the Empress, might she live forever, and while there had been the
occasional rebellion by some mad upstart with eyes on the Crystal Throne, the bulk of those years had
been spent preparing for this. For two generations, while the great ships were built to carry the
Return, the Ever Victorious Army had trained and prepared. Bakuun certainly had been proud when
he learned he was to be one of the Forerunners. Surely he could be forgiven dreams of retaking the
lands stolen from Artur Hawkwing’s rightful heirs, even wild dreams to completing this new
Consolidation before the Corenne came. Not such a wild dream after all, as it turned out, but not at all

the way he had imagined.
A returning patrol of fifty Taraboner lancers rode up the hillside, red and green stripes painted
across their solid breastplates, veils of mail hiding their thick mustaches. They rode well, and even
fought well, when they had decent leaders. More than ten times as many were already among the cook
fires, or down at the picket lines tending their mounts, and three patrols were still out. Bakuun had
never expected to find himself with well over half his command descendants of thieves. And
unashamed of it; they would look you straight in the eyes. The patrol’s commander bowed low to him
as their muddy-legged horses passed, but many of the others went on talking in their peculiar accents,
speaking too fast for Bakuun to understand without listening hard. They had peculiar notions of
discipline, too.
Shaking his head, Bakuun strode across to the sul’dam’s large tent. Larger than his, of necessity.
Four of them were sitting on stools outside in their dark blue dresses with the forked lightning on the
skirts, enjoying the sun during this break in the storms. Those were rare enough, now. The gray-clad
damane sat at their feet, with Nerith braiding her pale hair. Talking to her, as well, all of them joining
in and laughing softly. The bracelet on the end of the silvery a’dam’s leash lay on the ground. Bakuun
grunted sourly. He had a favorite wolfhound, back home, and even talked to him sometimes, but he
never expected Nip to carry on a conversation!
“Is she well?” he asked Nerith, not for the first time. Or the tenth. “Is everything well with her?”
The damane dropped her eyes and went silent.
“She is quite well, Captain Bakuun.” A square-faced woman, Nerith put the proper degree of
respect into her voice and not a whisker beyond. But she stroked the damane’s head soothingly while
she talked. “Whatever the indisposition, it is gone, now. A small thing, in any case. Nothing to worry
about.” The damane was trembling.
Bakuun grunted again. Not far from the answer he had received before. Something had been
wrong, though, back in Ebou Dar, and not just with this damane. The sul’dam had all been as tightlipped as clams—and the Blood would not say anything, of course, not to the likes of him!—but he
had heard too many whispers. They said the damane were all sick, or insane. Light, he had not seen a
single one used around Ebou Dar once the city was secured, not even for a victory display of Sky
Lights, and who had ever heard the like of that!
“Well, I hope she . . . ” he began, and cut off as a raken appeared, sweeping through the eastern
pass. Its great leathery wings beat powerfully for height, and right above the hill it suddenly tilted and
cut a tight circle, one wingtip pointed almost straight down. A thin red streamer fell away under the
weight of a lead ball.
Bakuun swallowed a curse. Fliers were always showing off, but if this pair injured one of his
men delivering their scouting report, he would have their hides no matter who he had to face to get
them. He would not have wanted to fight without fliers to scout, but they were coddled like some
Blood’s favorite pet.
Arrow-straight the streamer plummeted. The lead weight struck the ground and bounced on the
crest, almost beside the tall thin message pole, which was too long to lower unless there was a
message to send. Besides, when it was left down somebody was always stepping a horse on the thing
and breaking the joins.
Bakuun strode straight to his tent, but his First Lieutenant was already waiting with the mudstained streamer and the message tube. Tiras was a bony man a head taller than him, with an
unfortunate scrap of beard clinging to the point of his chin.
The report rolled up in the thin metal tube, on a slip of paper Bakuun could almost see through,

was written simply. He had never been forced to ride on raken or to’raken—the Light be thanked,
and the Empress, might she live forever, be praised!—but he doubted it was easy to handle a pen in a
saddle strapped to the back of a flying lizard. What it said made him flip open the lid of his small
camp desk and write hurriedly.
“There’s a force not ten miles east of here,” he told Tiras. “Five or six times our number.” Fliers
exaggerated sometimes, but not often by much. How had that many penetrated these mountains so far
without being spotted before? He had seen the coast to the east, and he wanted his burial prayers paid
for before he tried a landing there. Burn his eyes, the fliers boasted they would see a flea move
anywhere in the range. “No reason to think they know we’re here, but I’d not mind a few
reinforcements.”
Tiras laughed. “We’ll give them a brush of the damane, and that will be that if they outnumber us
by twenty times.” His only real fault was a touch of overconfidence. A good soldier, though.
“And if they have a few . . . Aes Sedai?” Bakuun said quietly, hardly stumbling over the name,
as he stuffed the flier’s report back into the tube with his own brief message. He had not really
believed anyone could let those . . . women run free.
Tiras’ face showed that he remembered the tales about an Aes Sedai weapon. The red streamer
floated behind him as he ran with the message tube.
Soon enough tube and streamer were attached to the tip of the message pole, a tiny breeze
stirring the long red strip fifteen paces above the hill crest. The raken soared toward it along the
valley, outstretched wings still as death. Abruptly one of the fliers swung down from the saddle and
hung—upside down!—below the raken’s trailing claws. It made Bakuun’s stomach hurt to watch. But
her hand closed on the streamer, the pole flexed, then vibrated back upright as the message tube
pulled free of the clip, and she scrambled back up as the creature climbed in slow circles.
Bakuun thankfully put raken and fliers out of his mind as he surveyed the valley. Broad and long,
nearly flat except for this hill, and surrounded by steep wooded slopes; only a goat could enter,
except by the passes in his sight. With the damane, he could cut anybody to pieces before they
managed to try attacking across that muddy meadow. He had passed word along, though; if the enemy
came straight on, they would arrive before any possible reinforcements by three days at best. How
had they come this far unseen?
He had missed the last battles of the Consolidation by two hundred years, but some of those
rebellions had not been small. Two years fighting on Marendalar, thirty thousand dead, and fifty times
that shipped back to the mainland as property. Taking notice of the strange kept a soldier alive.
Ordering the camp struck and all signs of it cleared, he began moving his command to the forested
slopes. Dark clouds were massing in the east, another of those cursed storms coming.

CHAPTER
23

Fog of War, Storm of Battle

N o rain fell, for the moment. Rand guided Tai’daishar around an uprooted tree lying across
the slope and frowned down at a dead man sprawled on his back behind the tree trunk. The
fellow was short and blocky, his face creased, and his armor all overlapping plates lacquered
blue and green, but staring sightlessly at the black clouds overhead, he looked a deal like Eagan
Padros, even to the missing leg. An officer, plainly; the sword beside his outflung hand had an
ivory hilt carved in the likeness of a woman, and his lacquered helmet, shaped like some huge
insect’s head, bore two long thin blue plumes.
Uprooted trees and shattered ones, a fair number burning from end to end, littered the slope of
the mountain for a good five hundred paces. Bodies, too, men broken or ripped apart when saidin
harrowed the mountainside. Most wore steel veils across their faces, and breastplates painted in
horizontal stripes. No women, thank the Light. The injured horses had been put down, another thing to
be thankful for. It was incredible how loudly a horse could scream.
Do you think the dead are silent? Lews Therin’s laugh was rasping. Do you? His voice turned
to pained rage. The dead howl at me!
At me, too, Rand thought sadly. I can’t afford to listen, but how do you shut them up? Lews
Therin began weeping for his lost Ilyena.
“A great victory,” Weiramon intoned behind Rand, then muttered, “But small honor in it. The old
ways are best.” Mud liberally decorated Rand’s coat, yet surprisingly, Weiramon appeared as
pristine as he had back on the Silver Road. His helmet and armor shone. How had he managed? The
Taraboners charged, at the end, lances and courage against the One Power, and Weiramon had led his
own charge to break them. Without orders, and followed by every Tairen save the Defenders, even a
half-drunk Torean, surprisingly. By Semaradrid and Gregorin Panar, too, with most of the Cairhienin
and Illianers. Standing still had been hard by that time, and every man wanted to come to grips with
something he actually could come to grips with. The Asha’man could have done it faster. If somewhat
more messily.
Rand had taken no part in the fighting, except to sit his saddle where men could see him. He had
been afraid to seize the Power. He did not dare display weakness for them to catch. Not a scrap.

Lews Therin gibbered with horror at the very idea.
Equally surprising as Weiramon’s unsullied coat, Anaiyella rode with him, and for once not
simpering. Her face was pinched and disapproving. Strangely, it did not spoil her looks nearly so
much as her unctuous smiles did. She had not joined the charge herself, of course, any more than Ailil,
but Anaiyella’s Master of the Horse had, and the man was most definitely dead, with a Taraboner
lance through his chest. She did not like that one bit. But why did she accompany Weiramon? Just
Tairens flocking together? Maybe. She had been with Sunamon, the last Rand had seen.
Bashere walked his bay up the slope, picking his way around the dead while seeming to pay
them no more mind than he did a splintered tree trunk or a burning stump. His helmet hung from his
saddle, and his gauntlets were stuffed behind his sword belt. He was mud all down his right side, and
his horse as well.
“Aracome’s gone,” he said. “Flinn tried Healing him, but I don’t think Aracome wanted to live
like that. There’s near fifty dead so far, and some of the rest might not survive.” Anaiyella paled.
Rand had seen her near Aracome, emptying herself. Dead commoners did not affect her so much.
Rand felt a moment of pity. Not for her, and not very much for Aracome. For Min, though she
was safely back in Cairhien. Min had foretold Aracome’s death from one of her viewings, and
Gueyam and Maraconn’s, too. Whatever she had seen, Rand hoped it had not been anywhere near the
reality.
Most of the Soldiers were off scouting again, but down in the broad meadow, gateways woven
by Gedwyn’s Dedicated were spilling out the supply carts and the remounts. The men coming with
them gaped as soon as they were clear enough to see. The muddy ground was not so well plowed as
the mountainside, yet blackened furrows, two paces wide and fifty long, carved through the brown
grass, and gaping holes a horse might not be able to leap. They had not found the damane so far. Rand
thought there had to be only one; more would have done considerably greater damage under the
circumstances.
Men moved around a number of small fires where water boiled for tea, among other things. For
once, Tairens, Cairhienin and Illianers mingled. Not just the commoners. Semaradrid was sharing his
saddle-flask with Gueyam, who wearily rubbed a hand over his bald head. Maraconn and Kiril
Drapaneos, a stork of a man whose square-cut beard looked odd on his narrow face, were squatting
on their heels near one of the fires. Playing cards, by the look of it! Torean had a whole circle of
laughing Cairhienin lordlings around him, though they might have been less amused by his jokes than
by the way he swayed and rubbed at his potato nose. The Legionmen kept apart, but they had taken in
the “volunteers” who had followed Padros to the Banner of Light. That lot seemed more eager than
anyone since learning how Padros died. Blue-coated Legionmen were showing them how to change
direction without falling apart like a gaggle of geese.
Flinn was among the wounded with Adley and Morr and Hopwil. Narishma could Heal little
more than minor cuts, no better than Rand, and Dashiva not even that. Gedwyn and Rochaid stood
talking well apart from anyone else, holding their horses by the reins atop the hill in the middle of the
valley. The hill where they had expected to catch the Seanchan by surprise when they rushed out of
gateways surrounding it. Near fifty dead, and more to come, but it would have been above two
hundred without Flinn and the rest who could manage Healing to one degree or another. Gedwyn and
Rochaid had not wanted to dirty their hands and grimaced when Rand drove them to it. One of the
dead was a Soldier, and another Soldier, a round-faced Cairhienin, sat slumped beside a fire with a
dazed look that Rand hoped came from being tossed through the air by the ground erupting almost
under his feet.

Down there on the furrowed flats, Ailil was conferring with her Lance-captain, a pale little man
called Denharad. Their horses stood nearly touching, and occasionally they looked up the mountain
toward Rand. What were they scheming?
“We’ll do better next time,” Bashere murmured. He ran his gaze around the valley, then shook
his head. “The worst mistake is to make the same one twice, and we won’t.”
Weiramon heard him and repeated the same thing, but using twenty times the words, and flowery
enough for a garden in spring. Without admitting that there had been any mistakes, certainly not on his
part. He avoided Rand’s mistakes with equal adroitness.
Rand nodded, his mouth tight. Next time they would do better. They had to, unless he wanted to
leave half his men buried in these mountains. Right then, he was wondering what to do with the
prisoners.
Most of those who escaped death on the mountainside had managed to withdraw through the
trees that remained standing. With amazingly good order considering, Bashere claimed, yet they were
unlikely to be much threat now. Not unless they had the damane with them. But a hundred or so men
sat huddled on the ground, stripped of weapons and armor, under the watchful eyes of two dozen
mounted Companions and Defenders. Taraboners, for the most part, they had not fought like men
driven to it by conquerors. A fair number held their heads up, and jeered at their guards. Gedwyn had
wanted to kill them, after putting them to the question. Weiramon did not care whether they had their
throats slit, but he considered torture a waste of time. None would know anything useful, he
maintained; there was not a one nobly born.
Rand glanced at Bashere. Weiramon was still going on sonorously. “. . . sweep these mountains
clean for you, my Lord Dragon. We’ll trample them beneath our hooves, and. . . .” Anaiyella was
nodding grim approval.
“Six up, and half a dozen down,” Bashere said softly. He scraped mud from one of his thick
mustaches with a fingernail. “Or as some of my tenants say, what you gain on the swings, you lose on
the roundabouts.” What in the Light was a roundabout? A great help that was!
And then one of Bashere’s patrols made matters worse.
The six men came prodding a prisoner along the slope ahead of their horses with the butts of
their lances. She was a black-haired woman in a torn and dirty dark blue dress, with red panels on the
breast and skirts bearing forked lightning. Her face was dirty, too, and tear-streaked. She stumbled
and half-fell, but the prodding was more gesture than actual touching. She glared scornfully at her
captors, even spitting once. She sneered at Rand, too.
“Did you hurt her?” he demanded. A strange question, perhaps, about an enemy after what had
happened in this valley. About a sul’dam. But it popped out.
“Not us, my Lord Dragon,” the gruff-faced patrol leader said. “We found her like this.”
Scratching his chin through a black flowing beard, he eyed Bashere as if for support. “She claims we
killed her Gille. A pet dog, or cat, or some such, the way she carries on. Her name’s Nerith. We got
that much out of her.” The woman turned and snarled at him again.
Rand sighed. Not a pet dog. No! That name did not belong on the list! But he could hear the
litany of names reciting itself in his head, and “Gille the damane” was there. Lews Therin moaned
for his Ilyena. Her name also was on the list. Rand thought it had a right.
“This is a Seanchan Aes Sedai?” Anaiyella asked suddenly, leaning over the pommel of her
saddle to peer hard at Nerith. Nerith spat at her, as well, eyes widening in outrage. Rand explained
the little he knew of sul’dam, that they controlled women who could channel with the aide of a leashand-collar ter’angreal but could not themselves channel, and to his surprise, the dainty simpering

High Lady said coldly, “If my Lord Dragon feels constrained, I’ll hang her for him.” Nerith spat at her
again! Contemptuously, this time. No shortfall of courage there.
“No!” Rand growled. Light, the things people would do to get on his good side! Or maybe
Anaiyella had been closer to her Master of the Horse than was considered proper. The man had been
stout and balding—and a commoner; that counted heavily with Tairens—but women did have strange
tastes in men. He knew that for a pure fact.
“As soon as we’re ready to move again,” he told Bashere, “turn the men down there loose.”
Taking prisoners along when he launched his next attack was out of the question, and leaving a
hundred men—a hundred now; more later, for sure—leaving them to follow with the supply carts
risked fifty kinds of mischief. They could cause no trouble left behind. Even the fellows who had
gotten away on horseback could not carry a warning faster than he could Travel.
Bashere shrugged faintly; he thought it might be so, but then again there was always the odd
chance. Strange things happened even without a ta’veren around.
Weiramon and Anaiyella opened their mouths almost together, faces set in protest, but Rand
pressed on. “I’ve spoken, and it’s done! We’ll keep the woman, though. And any more women we
capture.”
“Burn my soul,” Weiramon exclaimed. “Why?” The man appeared dumbfounded, and for that
matter, Bashere gave a startled jerk of his head. Anaiyella’s mouth twisted in contempt before she
managed to turn it to a simpering smile for the Lord Dragon. Plainly, she thought him too soft to send a
woman off with the others. They would have hard walking in this terrain, not to mention short rations.
And the weather was not weather to turn a woman out in.
“I have enough Aes Sedai against me without sending sul’dam back to their trade,” he told them.
The Light knew that was true! They nodded, if Weiramon was slow about it; Bashere looked relieved,
Anaiyella disappointed. But what to do with the woman, and any more he captured? He did not intend
to turn the Black Tower into a prison. The Aiel could hold them. Except that the Wise Ones might slit
their throats the moment his back was turned. What about the sisters that Mat was taking to Caemlyn
with Elayne, though? “When this is done, I’ll hand her over to some Aes Sedai I choose.” They might
see it as a gesture of goodwill, a little honey to sweeten their having to accept his protection.
No sooner were the words out of his mouth than Nerith’s face went dead white and she
screamed at the top of her lungs. Howling without cease, she flung herself down the slope, scrabbling
over downed trees, falling and scrambling back up.
“Bloody—! Catch her!” Rand snapped, and the Saldaean patrol leaped after the woman, jumping
their mounts across the tree-littered slope careless of broken legs and necks. Still wailing, she
dodged and darted among the horses with even less care.
In the mouth of the easternmost pass, a gateway opened in a flash of silver light. A black-coated
Soldier pulled his horse through, jumped to the saddle as the gateway winked out and put his mount to
a gallop, toward the hilltop where Gedwyn and Rochaid waited. Rand watched impassively. In his
head, Lews Therin snarled of killing, killing all the Asha’man before it was too late.
By the time the three of them started up the slope toward Rand, four of the Saldaeans had Nerith
down on the ground, binding her hand and foot. It took four, the way she thrashed and bit at them, and
an amused Bashere was offering odds on whether she might not overcome them instead. Anaiyella
muttered something about cracking the woman’s head. Did she mean cracking it open? Rand frowned
at her.
The Soldier between Gedwyn and Rochaid glanced at Nerith uneasily as they rode past. Rand
vaguely remembered seeing him at the Black Tower, the day he first handed out the silver Swords,

and gave Taim the very first Dragon pin. He was a young man, Varil Nensen by name, still wearing a
transparent veil to cover his thick mustaches. He had not hesitated when he found himself facing his
countrymen, though. Allegiance was to the Black Tower and the Dragon Reborn, now, so Taim
always said. The second part of that always sounded an afterthought.
“You may have the honor of making your report to the Dragon Reborn, Soldier Nensen,”
Gedwyn said. Wryly.
Nensen sat up straight in his saddle. “My Lord Dragon!” he barked, slapping fist to chest.
“There’s more of them about thirty miles west, my Lord Dragon.” Thirty miles was as far as Rand had
told the scouts to go before returning. What good if one Soldier found Seanchan while the rest kept
moving ever farther west? “Maybe half what were here,” Nensen went on. And. . . .” His dark eyes
flickered toward Nerith again. She was tied, now, the Saldaeans struggling to get her over a horse.
“And I saw no sign of women, my Lord Dragon.”
Bashere squinted at the sky. Dark clouds lay in a blanket from mountain peak to mountain peak,
but the sun should still be high. “Time to feed the men before the rest return,” he said, nodding in
satisfaction. Nerith had managed to sink her teeth into a Saldaean’s wrist and was hanging on like a
badger.
“Feed them quick,” Rand said irritably. Would every sul’dam he captured be as difficult? Very
likely. Light, what if they took a damane? “I don’t want to spend all winter in these mountains.” Gille
the damane. He could not erase a name once it went onto that list.
The dead are never silent, Lews Therin whispered. The dead never sleep.
Rand rode down toward the fires. He did not feel like eating.
From the point of a thrusting shoulder of stone, Furyk Karede carefully studied the forested
mountains rising all around him, sharp peaks like dark fangs. His horse, a tall dappled gelding,
stiffened his ears as though catching a sound he had missed, but otherwise the animal was still. Every
so often, Karede had to stop and wipe the lens of his looking glass. A light rain fell from a gray
morning sky. His helmet’s two black plumes were bent over instead of standing straight, and water
ran down his back. A light rain compared to yesterday, anyway, and probably compared to tomorrow.
Or this afternoon, perhaps. Thunder rumbled ominously in the south. Karede’s concern had nothing to
do with weather, though.
Below him, the last of twenty-three hundred men snaked through the winding passes, men
gathered from four outposts. Well-mounted, reasonably well-led, yet a bare two hundred were
Seanchan, and just two besides himself wore the red-and-green of the Guard. Most of the remainder
were Taraboners—he knew their mettle—but a good third were Amadicians and Altarans, too new to
their oaths for any to be sure how they would stand up. Some Altarans and Amadicians had switched
allegiance two or three times already. Tried to, anyway. People this side of the Aryth Ocean had no
shame. A dozen sul’dam rode near the front of the column, and he wished all twelve had leashed
damanes walking by their horses instead of only two.
Fifty paces farther on, the ten men of the spearhead were watching the slopes above them, though
not as carefully as they should have. Too many men who rode spearhead relied on the forward scouts
to find any dangers. Karede made a note to speak to them personally. They would do their duties
properly after that, or he would send them to the labor levies.
A raken appeared in the east ahead, skimming low over the treetops, twisting and turning to
follow the curves of the land like a man running his hand down a woman’s back. Peculiar.
Morat’raken, fliers, always liked to soar high unless the sky was actually full of lightning. Karede
lowered the looking glass to watch.

“Maybe we’ll finally get another scouting report,” Jadranka said. To the other officers waiting
behind Karede, not to him. Three of the ten matched Karede’s rank, yet few except the Blood
disturbed a man in the blood-red and nearly black green of the Deathwatch Guard. Not that many
among the Blood did.
According to the tales he had heard as a child, one of his ancestors, a noble, had followed
Luthair Paendrag to Seanchan at Artur Hawkwing’s command, but two hundred years later, with only
the north secure, another ancestor tried to carve out a kingdom of his own and ended sold from the
block instead. Perhaps it was so; many da’covale claimed noble ancestors. Among themselves, at
least; few of the Blood found such chatter amusing. In any case, Karede had felt lucky when the
Choosers picked him out, a sturdy boy not yet old enough to be assigned duties, and he still felt pride
in the ravens tattooed on his shoulders. Many Deathwatch Guards went without coat or shirt
whenever possible, to display those. The humans, anyway. Ogier Gardeners were not marked or
owned, but that was between them and the Empress.
Karede was da’covale and proud of it, like every man of the Guard, the property of the Crystal
Throne, body and soul. He fought where the Empress pointed, and would die the day she said die. To
the Empress alone did the Guard answer, and where they appeared, they appeared as her hand, a
visible reminder of her. No wonder that some among the Blood could become uneasy watching a
detachment of Guardsmen pass. A far better life than mucking out a Lord’s stables or serving kaf to a
Lady. But he cursed the luck that had sent him into these mountains to inspect the outposts.
The raken darted on westward, the two fliers crouched low in their saddle. There was no
scouting report, no message for him. Furyk knew it was his imagination, but the creature’s long,
outstretched neck somehow looked . . . anxious. Had he been anyone else, he might have been
anxious, too. There had been few messages for him since his orders three days ago to assume
command and move east. Each message had thickened the fog more than cleared it.
The locals, these Altarans, had moved into the mountains in force, it seemed, but how? The
roads along the northern border of this range were patrolled and watched nearly to the border of
Illian, by fliers and morat’torm as well as horse-mounted parties. What could have made the Altarans
decide to show so many teeth? To stand together? A man might find himself in a duel for a look—
though they had begun to learn challenging a Guardsman was just a slower way of cutting your own
throat—but he had seen nobles of this so-called nation trying to sell each other and their Queen for
the mere suggestion that their own lands might be protected and perhaps those of their neighbor added
to them.
Nadoc, a big man with a deceptively mild face, twisted in his saddle to watch the raken. “I don’t
like marching blind,” he muttered. “Not when the Altarans have managed to put forty thousand men up
here. Forty, at least.”
Jadranka snorted so hard that his tall white gelding shifted. Jadranka was the senior of the three
captains behind Karede, having served as long as Karede himself. A short thin man with a prominent
nose and such airs you might have thought him of the Blood. That horse would stand out at a mile.
“Forty thousand or a hundred, Nadoc, they’re scattered from here to the end of the range, too far apart
to support one another. Stab my eyes, likely half are dead already. They must be tangling with
outposts everywhere. That’s why we aren’t getting reports. We’re just expected to sweep up the
remnants.”
Karede swallowed a sigh. He had hoped Jadranka was not a fool atop his airs. Praise of victors
spread quickly, whether they were an army or half a Banner. It was the rare defeats that were
swallowed in silence and forgotten. So much silence was . . . ominous.

“That last report didn’t sound like remnants to me,” Nadoc persisted. He was no fool. “There
are five thousand men not fifty miles ahead of us, and I doubt we’ll take them with brooms.”
Jadranka snorted again. “We’ll crush them, with swords or brooms. The Light burn my eyes, I
can hardly wait for a decent engagement. I told the scouts to press on until they found them. I won’t
have them slipping away from us.”
“You did what?” Karede said softly.
Soft or not, his words jerked every eye toward him. Though Nadoc and a few of the others had
to struggle to stop gaping at Jadranka. Scouts told to press ahead, scouts told what to look for. What
had gone unseen for those orders?
Before anyone could open his mouth shouts rose from the men in the pass, screams and the
shrieks of horses.
Karede pressed the leather tube of the looking glass to his eye. Along the pass ahead of him, men
and horses were dying under a hail of what he thought must be crossbow bolts, the way they
hammered through steel breastplates, exploded through chests protected by mail. Hundreds were
down already, hundreds more sagging wounded in their saddles or afoot and running from horses
thrashing on the ground. Too many were running. Even as he looked, men still mounted whirled their
horses to try fleeing back up the pass. Where in the Light were the sul’dam? He could not find them.
He had faced rebels who had sul’dam and damane, and they always had to be killed as fast as
possible. Maybe the locals had learned that.
Suddenly, shockingly, the ground began to erupt in roaring fountains all along the writhing snake
of his command, fountains that flung men and horses into the air as easily as dirt and stones. Lightning
flashed out of the sky, blue-white bolts shattering earth and men alike. Other men simply exploded,
ripped to shreds by nothing he could see. Did the locals have damane of their own? No, it would be
those Aes Sedai.
“What are we going to do?” Nadoc said. He sounded shaken. As well he might.
“Do you think to abandon your men?” Jadranka snarled. “We rally them and attack, you—!” He
cut off, gurgling, as Karede’s swordpoint went neatly into his throat. There were times fools could be
tolerated, and times not. As the man toppled from his saddle, Karede deftly wiped his blade on the
gelding’s white mane before the animal bolted. There were times for a little show, too.
“We rally what can be rallied, Nadoc,” he said as if Jadranka had never spoken. As if he had
never been. “We save what can be saved, and fall back.”
Turning to ride down into the pass where lightnings flashed and thunders roared, he ordered
Anghar, a steady-eyed young man with a fast horse, to ride east and report what had transpired here.
Perhaps a flier would see and perhaps not, though Karede suspected he knew why they flew low,
now. He suspected the High Lady Suroth and the generals in Ebou Dar already knew what was
occurring up here, too. Was today the day he died for the Empress? He dug his heels into his horse’s
flanks.
From the flat, thinly treed ridge, Rand peered westward over the forest before him. With the
Power in him—life, so sweet; vileness, oh, so vile—he could see individual leaves, but it was not
enough. Tai’daishar stamped a hoof. The jagged peaks behind, to either side, and all around
overtopped the ridge by a mile or more, but the ridge stood well above the treetops below, a rolling
wooded valley over a league in length and nearly as wide. All was still down there. As quiet as the
Void he floated in. Quiet for the moment, anyway. Here and there plumes of smoke rose from where
two or three trees in a clump burned like torches. Only the general wet stopped them turning the
valley into a conflagration.

Flinn and Dashiva were the only Asha’man still with him. All the rest were down in the valley.
The pair stood a little way from him at the edge of the trees, holding their horses by the reins and
staring at the forest below. Well, Flinn stared, as intently as Rand himself. Dashiva glanced
occasionally, twisting his mouth, sometimes muttering to himself in a way that made Flinn shift his
feet and eye him sideways. The Power filled both men, nearly to overflowing, but for a change, Lews
Therin said nothing. The man seemed increasingly to have gone back into hiding over the last few
days.
In the sky there was actually sunlight, and the scattered clouds were gray. It was five days since
Rand had brought his small army to Altara, five days since he had seen his first Seanchan dead. He
had seen quite a few since. Thought slid across the surface of the Void. He could feel the heron
branded into his palm pressing against the Dragon Scepter through his glove. Silent. There were none
of the flying creatures to be seen. Three of those had died, slashed from the sky by lightning, before
their riders learned to stay clear. Bashere was fascinated by the creatures. Quiet.
“Perhaps it is finished, my Lord Dragon.” Ailil’s voice was calm and cool, but she patted her
mare’s neck, though the animal did not need soothing. She eyed Flinn and Dashiva sideways and
straightened, unwilling to reveal a shred of unease in front of them.
Rand found himself humming and stopped abruptly. That was Lews Therin’s habit, looking at a
pretty woman, not his. Not his! Light, if he started taking on the fellow’s mannerisms, and when he
was not there, at that . . . !
Abruptly, hollow thunder boomed up the valley. Fire fountained out of the trees a good two
miles away or more, then again, and again, again. Lightning streaked down into the forest not far from
where the tall flames had bloomed, single slashes like jagged blue-white lances. A flurry of lightning
bolts and fire, and all was still again. No trees had caught fire, this time.
Some of that had been saidin. Some of it.
Shouts rose, dim and distant, from another part of the valley, he thought. Too far for even his
saidin-enhanced ears to hear the crash of steel. Despite everything, not all of the fighting was being
done by Asha’man and Dedicated and Soldiers.
Anaiyella let out a long breath she must have been holding since the exchange with the Power
began. Men fighting with steel did not disturb her. Then she patted her mount’s neck. The gelding had
only flickered an ear. Rand had noticed that about women. Quite often, when a woman was agitated,
she tried to soothe others whether they required soothing or not. A horse would do. Where was Lews
Therin?
Irritably he leaned forward to study the forest canopy again. A good many of those trees were
evergreens—oak and pine and leatherleaf—and despite the late drought, they made an effective
screen, even to his intensified vision. As if idly, he touched the narrow bundle under his stirrup
leather. He could take a hand. And strike blindly. He could ride down into the woods. And be able to
see ten paces at most. Down there, he would be little more effective than one of the Soldiers.
A gateway opened among the trees a little way along the ridge, silvery slash widening into a
hole that showed different trees and thick winter brown underbrush. A copper-skinned Soldier with a
thin mustache on his upper lip and a small pearl in his ear exited afoot and let the gateway vanish. He
was shoving a sul’dam ahead of him with her wrists tied behind her, a handsome woman except for
the purple knot on the side of her head. That seemed to go along with her scowl, though, as well as it
did with her rumpled, leaf-stained dress. She sneered over her shoulder at the Soldier while he
pushed her along the ridgetop to Rand, and then she sneered up at Rand.
The Soldier stiffened, saluting smartly. “Soldier Arlen Nalaam, my Lord Dragon,” he barked,

staring straight at Rand’s saddle. “My Lord Dragon’s orders were to bring any women captured to
him.”
Rand nodded. It was only to give him the appearance of doing something, inspecting prisoners to
be sure they were what any idiot could see they were. “Take her back to the carts, Soldier Nalaam,
then return to the fighting.” He almost ground his teeth saying that. Return to the fighting. While Rand
al’Thor, Dragon. Reborn and King of Illian, sat his horse and watched treetops!
Nalaam saluted again before pushing away the woman ahead of him, but he was not slow about
it. She kept peering over her shoulder again, yet not at the Soldier this time. At Rand. With wideeyed, openmouthed astonishment. For some reason, Nalaam did not pull her to a halt until he reached
the spot where he had come out. All that was necessary was to go far enough to avoid injuring the
horses.
“What are you doing?” Rand demanded as saidin filled the man.
Nalaam half turned back to him, hesitating briefly. “It seems easier, here, if I use a place I’ve
already made a gateway, my Lord Dragon. Saidin . . . Saidin feels . . . strange . . . to me here.” His
prisoner turned to frown at him.
After a moment, Rand gestured him to go ahead. Flinn pretended to be interested in his horse’s
saddle girth, but the balding old man smiled faintly. Smugly. Dashiva . . . giggled. Flinn had been the
first to mention an odd feel to saidin in this valley. Of course, Narishma and Hopwil had heard him,
and Morr added his tales of the “strangeness” around Ebou Dar. Small wonder everyone was
claiming to feel something now, though not a one could say what. Saidin just felt . . . peculiar. Light,
with the taint thick on the male half of the Source, what else would it feel? Rand hoped they were not
all coming down with his new sickness.
Nalaam’s gateway opened, and vanished behind him and his prisoner. Rand let himself really
feel saidin. Life and corruption commingled; ice to make winter’s heart seem warm, and fire to make
a forge’s flames cold; death, waiting for him to slip. Wanting him to slip. It did not feel any different.
Did it? He scowled at where Nalaam had disappeared. Nalaam and the woman.
She was the fourth sul’dam taken this afternoon. That made twenty-three sul’dam prisoners with
the carts. And two damane, each still in her silvery leash and collar, carried on separate carts; in
those collars, they could not walk three steps before becoming more violently sick than Rand did
seizing the Source. He was not sure the sisters with Mat would be pleased to receive them after all.
The first damane, three days before, he had not thought of as a prisoner. A slender woman with pale
yellow hair and big blue eyes, she was a Seanchan captive to be freed. He thought. But when he
forced a sul’dam to remove the woman’s collar, her a’dam, she screamed for the sul’dam to help her
and immediately began lashing out with the Power. She had even offered her neck for the sul’dam to
replace the thing! Nine Defenders and a Soldier died before she could be shielded. Gedwyn would
have killed her on the spot had Rand not stopped it. The Defenders, nearly as uncomfortable around
women who could channel as others were around men who could—the Defenders still wanted her
dead. They had taken casualties in the fighting these past days, but having men killed by a prisoner
seemed to offend them.
There had been more casualties than Rand had expected. Thirty-one Defenders dead, and fortysix Companions. More than two hundred among the Legionmen and the noble’s armsmen. Seven
Soldiers and a Dedicated, men Rand had never met before they answered his summons to Illian. Too
many, considering that all except the gravest injury could be Healed, if a man could only hang on until
there was time. But he was driving the Seanchan west. Driving them hard.
More shouting rose somewhere far off down in the valley. Fire blossomed a good three miles to

the west, and lightning struck, toppling trees. Trees and stone erupted from a mountainside farther on,
strange fountains marching along the slope. The roaring booms swallowed shouts. The Seanchan were
retreating.
“Get down there,” Rand told Flinn and Dashiva. “Both of you. Find Gedwyn and tell him I said
push! Push!”
Dashiva grimaced at the forest below, then began awkwardly tugging his horse along the ridge.
The man was ungainly with horses, riding or leading. He nearly tripped over his sword!
Flinn looked up at Rand worriedly. “You mean to stay here alone, my Lord Dragon?”
“I’m hardly alone,” Rand said dryly, glancing at Ailil and Anaiyella. They had ridden back to
their armsmen, almost two hundred lancers waiting just short of where the ridge began to slope down
to the east. At their head, Denharad frowned through the face-bars of his helmet. He had command of
both lots, now, and if his concern was for Ailil and Anaiyella, his fellows still made a show fit to
keep away most attackers. Besides, Weiramon had the northern end of this ridge secured so a fly
could not pass, he claimed, and Bashere held the south. Without boasting; Bashere just erected a wall
of lances without talking about it. And the Seanchan were retreating. “And I’m hardly helpless,
anyway, Flinn.”
Flinn actually looked doubtful and scratched his fringe of white hair before saluting and leading
his horse toward where Dashiva’s gateway was already winking out. Limping along, Flinn shook his
head, muttering to himself fit for Dashiva. Rand wanted to snarl. He could not go mad, and neither
could they.
Flinn’s gateway vanished, and Rand returned to his study of the treetops. It was quiet again.
Time stretched in stillness. This notion of taking the outposts in the mountains had been a bad one; he
was willing to admit that, now. In this terrain, you could be half a mile from an army without
knowing. In those tangled woods down there, you could be ten feet from them without knowing! He
needed to face the Seanchan on better ground. He needed. . . .
Abruptly he was fighting saidin, fighting wild surges that tried to ream out his skull. The Void
was vanishing, melting beneath the onslaught. Frantic, dazed, he released the Source before it could
kill him. Nausea twisted his middle. Double vision showed him two Crowns of Swords. Lying on the
thick mulch of dead leaves in front of his face! He was on the ground! He could not seem to breathe
properly, and struggled to suck in air. There was a chip broken off one of the crown’s golden laurel
leaves, and blood stained several of the tiny golden swordpoints. A knot of hot pain in his side told
him those never-healing wounds had broken open. He tried to push himself up, and cried out. In
stunned amazement he stared at the dark fletchings of an arrow stuck through his right arm. With a
groan he collapsed. Something ran down his face. Something dripped in front of his eye. Blood.
Vaguely he became aware of ululating cries. Horsemen appeared among the trees to the north,
galloping along the ridge, some with lowered lances, some working short bows as fast as they could
nock and draw. Horsemen in blue-and-yellow armor of overlapping plates, and helmets like huge
insects’ heads. Seanchan, several hundred of them it seemed. From the north. So much for
Weiramon’s fly.
Rand struggled to reach the Source. Too late to worry about sicking up, or falling on his face.
Another time, he might have laughed at that. He struggled. . . . It was like fumbling for a pin in the
dark with numbed fingers.
Time to die, Lews Therin whispered. Rand had always known Lews Therin would be there at
the end.
Not fifty paces from Rand, screaming Tairens and Cairhien plowed into the Seanchan.

“Fight, you dogs!” Anaiyella shrieked, swinging down from her saddle beside him. “Fight!” The
willow lady in her silks and laces hurled a string of curses that would have made a wagon driver’s
tongue go dry.
Anaiyella stood holding her mount’s reins, glaring from the mill of men and steel to Rand. It was
Ailil who turned him onto his back. Kneeling there, she looked down at him with an unreadable
expression in her big dark eyes. He could not seem to move. He felt drained. He was not sure he
could blink. Screams and the clash of steel rang in his ears.
“If he dies on our hands, Bashere will hang both of us!” Anaiyella certainly was not simpering
now. “If those black-coated monsters get hold of us . . . !” She shuddered, and bent closer to Ailil,
gesturing with a belt knife he had not noticed in her hand before. A ruby sparkled blood-red on the
hilt. “Your Lance-captain could break off enough men to get us away. We could be miles away before
he’s found, and back to our estates by the time—”
“I think he can hear us,” Ailil broke in calmly. Her red-gloved hands moved at her waist.
Sheathing a belt knife? Or drawing one? “If he dies here—” She cut off as sharply as the other woman
had, and her head jerked around.
Hooves thundered past Rand on either side in thick streams. Galloping north, toward the
Seanchan. Sword in hand, Bashere barely reined in before leaping from his saddle. Gregorin Panar
dismounted more slowly, but he waved his sword at the men flooding by. “Strike home for King and
Illian!” he shouted. “Strike home! The Lord of the Morning! The Lord of the Morning!” The crash of
steel rose higher. And the screaming.
“ I t would be like this at the last of it,” Bashere growled, favoring the two women with
suspicious glares. He wasted only an instant, though, before raising his voice above the din of battle.
“Morr! Burn your Asha’man hide! Here, now!” He did not shout that the Lord Dragon was down,
thank the Light.
With an effort, Rand turned his head perhaps a hand. Enough to see Illianers and Saldaeans
driving on north. The Seanchan must have given way.
“Morr!” The name roared through Bashere’s mustaches, and Morr himself dropped from a
galloping horse nearly on top of Anaiyella. She looked disgruntled at the lack of an apology as the
man knelt beside Rand, scrubbing dark hair out of his face. She moved back quickly enough when she
realized he intended to channel, though, practically bounding away. Ailil was much smoother about
rising, but not noticeably slower in stepping clear. And she slipped a silver-handled belt knife back
into its sheath at her waist.
Healing was a simple matter, if not exactly comfortable. The fletchings were broken off and the
arrow drawn the rest of the way through with a sharp jerk that brought a gasp to Rand’s lips, but that
was just to clear the way. Dirt and lightly embedded fragments would fall away as flesh knit itself up,
but only Flinn and a few others could use the Power to remove what was driven deep. Resting two
fingers on Rand’s chest, Morr caught his tongue between his teeth with a fixed expression and wove
Healing. That was how he always did it; it did not work for him, otherwise. It was not the complex
weaves that Flinn used. Few could manage that, and none as well as Flinn, so far. This was simpler.
Rougher. Waves of heat rushed through Rand, strong enough to make him grunt and send sweat
gushing from every pore. He quivered violently from head to foot. A roast in the oven must have felt
that way.
The sudden flood of heat ebbed slowly, and Rand lay panting. In his head, Lews Therin panted,
too. Kill him! Kill him! Over and over.
Muting the voice to a faint buzz, Rand thanked Morr—the young man blinked as if surprised!—

then grabbed the Dragon Scepter from the ground and forced himself to his feet. Erect, he swayed
slightly. Bashere started to offer an arm, then backed away at a gesture. Rand could stand unaided.
Barely. He could as soon have flown by waving his arms as channeled, though. When he touched his
side, his shirt slipped on blood, yet the old round scar and the newer slash across it merely felt
tender. Half-healed only, but they had never been better than that since he got them.
For a moment, he studied the two women. Anaiyella murmured something vaguely congratulatory
and offered him a smile that made him wonder whether she intended to lick his wrist. Ailil stood very
straight, very cool, as if nothing had happened. Had they meant to leave him to die? Or to kill him?
But if so, why send their armsmen charging in and rush to check on him? On the other hand, Ailil had
drawn her knife once the talk of him dying began.
Most of the Saldaeans and Illianers were galloping north or riding down the slope of the ridge,
pursuing the last of the Seanchan. And then Weiramon appeared from the north, riding a tall, glossy
black at a slow canter that picked up when he saw Rand. His armsmen rode in double file at his back.
“My Lord Dragon,” the High Lord intoned as he dismounted. Hestill seemed as clean as he had
in Illian. Bashere simply looked rumpled and a bit grimy here and there, but Gregorin’s finery was
decidedly dirt-stained, and slashed down one sleeve besides. Weiramon flourished a bow to shame a
king’s court. “Forgive me, my Lord Dragon. I thought I saw Seanchan advancing in front of the ridge
and went to meet them. I never suspected this other company. You can’t know how it would pain me
if you were injured.”
“I think I know,” Rand said dryly, and Weiramon blinked. Seanchan advancing? Perhaps.
Weiramon would always snatch at a chance for glory in the charge. “What did you mean, ‘at the last,’
Bashere?”
“They’re pulling back,” Bashere replied. In the valley, fire and lightning erupted for a moment as
if to give him the lie, but nearly to the far end.
“Your . . . scouts do say they all do be retreating,” Gregorin said, rubbing his beard, and gave
Morr a sidelong, uncomfortable glance. Morr grinned at him toothily. Rand had seen the Illianer in the
thick of fighting heading his men, shouting encouragement and laying his sword about with wild
abandon, but he flinched at Morr’s grin.
Gedwyn strode up then, leading his horse carelessly, insolently. He almost sneered at Bashere
and Gregorin, frowned at Weiramon as if already knowing the man’s blunder, and eyed Ailil and
Anaiyella as though he might pinch them. The two women drew back from him hastily, but then, so
did the men except for Bashere. Even Morr. Gedwyn’s salute to Rand was a casual tap of fist to
chest. “I sent scouts out as soon as I saw this lot was done. There are three more columns inside ten
miles.”
“All headed west,” Bashere put in quietly, but he looked at Gedwyn sharp enough to slice stone.
“You’ve done it,” he told Rand. “They’re all falling back. I doubt they’ll stop short of Ebou Dar.
Campaigns don’t always end with a grand march into the city, and this one is finished.”
Surprisingly—or perhaps not—Weiramon began arguing for an advance, to “take Ebou Dar for
the glory of the Lord of the Morning,” as he put it, but it was certainly a shock to hear Gedwyn say he
would not mind taking a few more swipes at these Seanchan and he certainly would not mind seeing
Ebou Dar. Even Ailil and Anaiyella added their voices in favor of “putting an end to the Seanchan
once and for all,” though Ailil did add that she would as soon like to avoid having to return to finish.
She was quite sure the Lord Dragon would insist on her company for it. That in a tone as cool and dry
as night in the Aiel Waste.
Only Bashere and Gregorin spoke for turning back, and raise their voices they did increasingly

as Rand stood silent. Silent and staring west. Toward Ebou Dar.
“We did do what we came for,” Gregorin insisted. “Light’s mercy, do you think to take Ebou
Dar itself?”
Take Ebou Dar, Rand thought. Why not? No one would expect that. A total surprise, for the
Seanchan and everybody else.
“Times are, you seize the advantage and ride on,” Bashere growled. “Other times, you take your
winnings and go home. I say it’s time to go home.”
I would not mind you in my head, Lews Therin said, sounding almost sane, if you were not so
clearly mad.
Ebou Dar. Rand tightened his hand on the Dragon Scepter, and Lews Therin cackled.

A Time for Iron

A dozen leagues east of Ebou Dar, raken glided in out of the cloud-streaked sunrise to land in
a long pasture marked as the fliers’ field by colored streamers on tall poles. The brown grasses
had been trampled and scored days since. All of the creatures’ grace in the air was lost as soon
as their claws touched the ground in a lumbering run, leathery pinions thirty paces or more wide
held high as if the animal wanted to sweep itself back upward. There was little beauty, either, in
the raken that ran awkwardly down the field beating ribbed wings, fliers crouching in the saddle
as if to pull the beast up by main force, ran on until at last they stumbled into the air, wingtips
barely clearing the tops of the olive trees at the end of the field. Only as they gained height and
turned toward the sun, soared toward the clouds, did the raken regain dignified grandeur. Fliers
who landed did not bother to dismount. While a groundling held a basket up for the raken to gulp
whole shriveled fruits by the double-handful at a time, one of the fliers would hand down their
scouting report to a still more senior groundling, and the other bent on the other side to receive
new orders from a flier too senior to handle reins personally very often. Almost that quickly
after coming to a halt, the creature was reined around to waddle over to where four or five
others waited their turn to make that long, ungainly run to the sky.
At a dead run, dodging between moving formations of cavalry and infantry, messengers carried
the scouting reports to the huge red-bannered command tent. There were haughty Taraboner lancers
and stolid Amadician pikemen in well-ordered squares, breastplates striped horizontally in the colors
of the regiments they were attached to. Altaran light horse in disordered bunches made their mounts
prance, vain of the red slashes crisscrossing their chests, so different from the markings anyone else
wore. The Altarans did not know those indicated irregulars of doubtful reliability. Among the
Seanchan soldiers, named regiments with proud honors were represented, from every corner of the
Empire, pale-eyed men from Alqam, honey-brown men from N’Kon, men black as coal from
Khoweal and Dalenshar. There were morat’torm on their sinuous bronze-scaled mounts that made
horses whicker and dance in fright, and even a few morat’grolm with their squat, beak-mouthed
charges, but one thing that always accompanied a Seanchan army was conspicuous by it absence. The
sul’dam and damane were still in their tents. Captain-General Kennar Miraj thought ofsul’dam and
damane a great deal.
From his seat on the dais he could see the map table clearly, where helmetless under-lieutenants
checked the reports and placed markers to represent the forces in the field. A small paper banner

stood above each marker, inked symbols giving the size and composition of the force. Finding decent
maps in these lands was next to impossible, but the map copied atop the large table was sufficient.
And worrying, in what it told him. Black discs for outposts overrun or dispersed. Far too many of
those, dotting the whole eastern half of the Venir range. Red wedges, for commands on the move,
marked the western end as thickly, all pointed back toward Ebou Dar. And scattered among the black
discs, seventeen stark white. As he watched, a young officer in the brown-and-black of a morat’torm
carefully placed an eighteenth. Enemy forces. A few might be the same group seen twice, but for the
most part they were much too far apart, the timing of the sightings wrong.
Along the walls of the tent, clerks in plain brown coats, marked only with insignia of rank among
clerks on the wide collars, waited at their writing tables, pens in hand, for Miraj to issue orders that
they would copy out for distribution. He had already given what orders he could. There were as many
as ninety thousand enemy soldiers in the mountains, nearly twice what he could muster here even with
the native levies. Too many for belief, except that scouts did not lie; liars had their throats slit by their
fellows. Too many, springing out of the ground like trap-worms in the Sen T’jore. At least they had a
hundred miles of mountain yet to cover if they intended to threaten Ebou Dar. Almost two hundred, for
the white discs farthest east. And hill country after that for another hundred miles. Surely the enemy
general could not mean to let his dispersed forces be confronted one by one. Gathering them together
would take more time. Time alone was on his side, right then.
The entry flaps of the tent swept open, and the High Lady Suroth glided in, black hair a proud
crest spilling down her back, pleated snow-white gown and richly embroidered over-robe somehow
untouched by the mud outside. He had thought her still in Ebou Dar; she must have flown out by
to’raken. She was accompanied by a small entourage, for her. A pair of Deathwatch Guards with
black tassels on their sword hilts held the tentflaps, and more were visible outside, stone-faced men
in red-and-green. The embodiment of the Empress, might she live forever. Even the Blood took note
of them. Suroth sailed past as if they were as much servants as the lushly bodied da’covale in
slippers and a nearly transparent white robe, her honey-yellow hair in a multitude of thin braids, who
carried the High Lady’s gilded writing desk a meek two paces behind. Suroth’s Voice of the Blood,
Alwhin, a glowering woman in green robes with the left side of her head shaved and the remainder of
her pale brown hair in a severe braid, followed close on her mistress’s heels. As Miraj stepped
down from the dais, he realized with shock that the second da’covale behind Suroth, short and darkhaired and slim in her diaphanous robe, was damane! A damane garbed as property was unheard of,
but odder still, it was Alwhin who led her by the a’dam!
He let none of his amazement show as he went to one knee, murmuring, “The Light be upon the
High Lady Suroth. All honor to the High Lady Suroth.” Everyone else prostrated themselves on the
canvas groundcloth, eyes down. Miraj was of the Blood, if too low to shave the sides of his scalp
like Suroth. Only the nails of his little fingers were lacquered. Much too low to register surprise if a
High Lady allowed her Voice to continue acting as sul’dam after being raised to the so’jhin. Strange
times in a strange land, where the Dragon Reborn walked and marath’damane ran wild to kill and
enslave where they would.
Suroth barely glanced at him before turning to study the map table, and if her black eyes
tightened at what she saw, she had cause. Under her, the Hailene had done far more than had been
dreamed, reclaiming great stretches of the stolen lands. All they had been sent for was to scout the
way, and after Falme, some had thought even that impossible. She drummed fingers on the table
irritably, the long blue-lacquered fingernails on the first two clicking. Continued success, and she
might be able to shave her head entirely and paint a third nail on each hand. Adoption into the

Imperial family was not unheard of for achievements so great. And if she stepped too far,
overstepped, she might find her fingernails clipped and herself stuffed into a filmy robe to serve one
of the Blood, if not sold to a farmer to help till his fields, or sweat in a warehouse. At worst, Miraj
would only have to open his own veins.
He continued to watch Suroth in patient silence, but he had been a scout lieutenant, morat’raken,
before being raised to the Blood, and he could not help being aware of everything around him. A
scout lived or died by what he saw or did not, and so did others. The men lying on their faces around
the tent; some hardly seemed to breathe. Suroth should have taken him aside and let them continue
with their work. A messenger was being turned back by the soldiers at the entrance. How dire was
the message that the woman tried to push past Deathwatch Guards?
The da’covale with the writing desk in her arms caught his eye. Scowls flashed across her pretty
doll’s face, never pushed down for more than moments. Property showing anger? And there was
something else. His gaze flickered to the damane, who stood with her head down but still looked
around with curiosity. Brown-eyed da’covale and pale-eyed damane looked about as different as two
women could, yet there was something about them. Something in their faces. Strange. He could not
have said how old either was.
Quick as his glance was, Alwhin noticed. With a twitch of the a’dam’s silvery leash she put the
damane facedown on the groundcloth. Snapping her fingers, she pointed to the canvas with the hand
not encumbered by the a’dam’s bracelet, then grimaced when the honey-haired da’covale did not
move. “Down, Liandrin!” she hissed almost under her breath. With a glare for Alwhin—a glare!—the
da’covale sank to her knees, features painted with sulkiness.
Most strange. But hardly important. Face impassive, and otherwise bursting with impatience, he
waited. Impatience and no little discomfort. He had been raised to the Blood after riding fifty miles in
a single night with three arrows in him to bring word of a rebel army marching on Seandar itself, and
his back still pained him.
Finally, Suroth turned from the map table. She did not give him leave to rise, much less embrace
him as one of the Blood. Not that he had expected that. He was far beneath her. “You are ready to
march?” she demanded curtly. At least she did not speak to him through her Voice. Before so many of
his officers, the shame would have put his eyes on the ground for months if not years.
“I will be, Suroth,” he replied calmly, meeting her gaze. He was of the Blood, however low.
“They cannot combine in fewer than ten days, with at least another ten before they can exit the
mountains. Well before then, I—”
“They could be here tomorrow,” she snapped. “Today! If they come, Miraj, they will come by
the ancient art of Traveling, and it seems very possible that they will come.”
He heard men shifting on their bellies before they could restrain themselves. Suroth lost control
of her emotions and babbled of legends? “Are you certain?” The words popped out of his mouth
before he could stop them.
He had only thought she had lost control before. Her eyes blazed. She gripped the edges of her
flower-worked robe, white-knuckled, and her hands shook. “Do you question me?” she snarled
incredulously. “Suffice it that I have my sources of information.” And was furious with them as much
as with him, he realized. “If they come, there will be perhaps as many as fifty of these grandly named
Asha’man, but no more than five or six thousand soldiers. It seems there have been no more since the
beginning, whatever the fliers say.”
Miraj nodded slowly. Five thousand men, moved about in some way with the One Power, would
explain a great deal. What were her sources, that she knew numbers so precisely? He was not fool

enough to ask. She certainly had Listeners and Seekers in her service. Watching her, too. Fifty
Asha’man. The very idea of a man channeling made him want to spit in disgust. Rumor claimed they
were being gathered from every nation by the Dragon Reborn, this Rand al’Thor, but he had never
expected there could be so many. The Dragon Reborn could channel, it was said. That might be true,
but he was the Dragon Reborn.
The Prophecies of the Dragon had been known in Seanchan even before Luthair Paendrag began
the Consolidation. In corrupted form, it was said, much different from the pure version Luthair
Paendrag brought. Miraj had seen several volumes of The Karaethon Cycle printed in these lands,
and they were corrupted too—not one mentioned him serving the Crystal Throne!—but the Prophecies
held men’s minds and hearts still. More than a few hoped the Return came soon, that these lands could
be reclaimed before Tarmon Gai’don so the Dragon Reborn could win the Last Battle for the glory of
the Empress, might she live forever. The Empress surely would want al’Thor sent to her, so she could
see what sort of man served her. There would be no difficulty with al’Thor once he had knelt to her.
Few easily shook off the awe they felt, kneeling before the Crystal Throne, with the thirst to obey
drying their tongues. But it seemed obvious that bundling the fellow onto a ship would be easier if
disposing of the Asha’man—they had to be disposed of, certainly—waited until al’Thor was well on
his way across the Aryth Ocean to Seandar.
Which brought him back to the problem he had been trying to avoid, he realized with an inward
start. He was not a man to shy from difficulties, much less ignore them blindly, but this was different
from any he had faced before. He had fought in two dozen battles with damane used on both sides; he
knew the way of them. It was not only a matter of striking out with the Power. Experienced sul’dam
could somehow see what damane or marath’damane did and damane would tell the others, so they
could defend as well. Could sul’dam see what a man did, too? Worse. . . .
“You will release the sul’dam and damane to me?” he said. Taking a deep breath in spite of
himself, he added, “If they’re still sick, it will be a short fight and bloody. On our side.”
Which produced another stir among the men waiting on their faces. Every second rumor in the
camp was about what illness had confined the sul’dam and damane to their tents. Alwhin reacted
quite openly, most improper in a so’jhin, with a furious glare. The damane flinched again, and began
to shiver where she lay. Oddly, the honey-haired da’covale flinched, as well.
Smiling, Suroth glided to where the da’covale knelt. Why would she smile at a poorly trained
serving girl? She began stroking the kneeling woman’s thin braids, and a sullen pout appeared on that
rosebud mouth. A former noblewoman of these lands? Suroth’s first words supported that, though
obviously meant for him. “Small failures bring small costs; great failures bring painfully great costs.
You will have the damane you require, Miraj. And you will teach these Asha’man they should have
remained in the north. You will wipe them from the face of the earth, the Asha’man, the soldiers, all
of them. To the man. Miraj. I have spoken.”
“It will be as you say, Suroth,” he replied. “They will be destroyed. To the man.” There was
nothing else he could say, now. He wished, though, that she had given him an answer about whether
the sul’dam and damane were still sick.
Rand reined Tai’daishar around near the crest of the bare, stony hill to watch most of his small
army spilling out of other holes in the air. He held hard to the True Source, so hard it seemed to
tremble in his grasp. With the Power in him, the sharp points of the Crown of Swords pricking his
temples felt at once keener than ever and utterly removed, the midmorning chill both colder and
beneath notice. The never-healing wounds in his side were a dull and distant ache. Lews Therin
seemed to be panting in uncertainty. Or perhaps fear. Maybe after coming so close to death the day

before, he did not want so much to die anymore. But then, he did not always want to die. The only
constant in the man was the desire to kill. Which just happened to include killing himself, often
enough.
There’ll be killing enough for anybody, soon, Rand thought. Light, the last six days were
enough to sicken a vulture. Had it only been six days? The disgust did not touch him, though. He
would not let it. Lews Therin did not answer. Yes. It was a time for iron hearts. And iron stomachs,
too. He bent a moment to touch the long cloth-wrapped package under his stirrup leather. No. Not
time, yet. Maybe not at all. Uncertainty shimmered across the Void, and maybe something else. Not at
all, he hoped. Uncertainty, yes, but the other had not been fear. It had not!
Half the surrounding low hills were covered with squat, gnarled olive trees, dappled by the
sunlight, where lancers already rode along the rows to make sure they were clear. There was no sign
of workers in those orchards, no farmhouse, no structure of any kind in sight. A few miles to the west,
the hills were darker, forested. Legionmen, emerging in trotting files below Rand, formed up, trailed
by a ragged square of Illianer volunteers, now enlisted into the Legion. As soon as their ranks were
aligned, they marched out of the way to make room for Defenders and Companions. The ground
seemed mostly clay, and boots and hooves alike skidded in the thin skim of mud. For a wonder,
though, only a few clouds hung in the sky, white and clean. The sun was a pale yellow ball. And
nothing flew up there larger than a sparrow.
Dashiva and Flinn were among the men holding gateways, as were Adley and Hopwil, Morr and
Narishma. Some of the gateways lay out of Rand’s sight behind the folded hills. He wanted everyone
through as quickly as possible, and except for a few Soldiers scanning the sky, every man in a black
coat who was not already out scouting held a weave. Even Gedwyn and Rochaid, though both
grimaced over it, at each other and in his direction. Rand thought them no longer used to doing
anything so common as holding a gateway for others to use.
Bashere cantered up the slope, very much at ease with himself, and with his short bay. His cloak
was flung back despite the morning’s coolness, not so cold as the mountains, but still wintery. He
nodded casually to Anaiyella and Ailil, who gave bleak stares in return. Bashere smiled through those
thick mustaches, like down-curving horns, a not entirely pleasant smile. He had as many doubts of the
women as Rand did. The women knew, about Bashere’s reservations at least. Turning her head
quickly from the Saldaean, Anaiyella returned to stroking her gelding’s mane; Ailil held her reins too
rigidly.
That pair had not strayed far from Rand since the incident on the ridge, even having their tents
pitched in earshot of his the night before. On a brown-grass hillside opposite, Denharad shifted to
study the two noblewomen’s retainers, arrayed together behind him, then quickly returned to watching
Rand. Very likely he watched Ailil, and maybe Anaiyella as well, but he watched Rand without
doubt. Rand was unsure whether they still feared to take the blame if he was killed or simply wanted
to see it happen. The one thing he was certain of was that if they did want him dead, he would give
them no opportunity.
Who knows a woman’s heart ? Lews Therin chuckled wryly. He sounded in one of his saner
moods. Most women will shrug off what a man would kill you for, and kill you for what a man
would shrug off.
Rand ignored him. The last gateway in Rand’s sight winked out. The Asha’man mounting their
horses were too far for him to say for sure whether any still held on to saidin, but it did not matter so
long as he did. Clumsy Dashiva tried to mount quickly and nearly fell off twice before successfully
reaching his saddle. Most of the black-coated men in view began riding north or south.

The rest of the nobles gathered quickly with Bashere on the slope just below Rand, the highest
ranking and those with the most power in front after a little jostling here and there, where precedence
remained uncertain. Tihera and Marcolin kept their horses on the fringes, on opposite sides of the
mass of nobles, faces carefully blank; they might be asked for advice, but both knew the final
decisions rested with others. Weiramon opened his mouth with a grand gesture, doubtless to begin
another splendid peroration on the glories of following the Dragon Reborn. Sunamon and Torean,
accustomed to his speeches and powerful enough to take no care around him, reined their horses
together and began talking quietly. Sunamon’s face wore an unaccustomed hardness, and Torean
seemed ready to squabble over a boundary line despite the red satin stripes on his coatsleeves.
Square-jawed Bertome and some of the other Cairhienin were not quiet at all, laughing at each other’s
jokes. Everyone had had a bellyful of Weiramon’s grand declamations. Though Semaradrid’s scowl
deepened every time he looked at Ailil and Anaiyella—he did not like them remaining close to Rand,
especially his countrywoman—so perhaps his sourness had more root than Weiramon’s windiness.
“About ten miles from us,” Rand said loudly, “a good fifty thousand men are preparing to
march.” They were aware of that, but it pulled every eye to him and silenced every tongue.
Weiramon’s mouth snapped shut sourly; the fellow did love to hear himself talk. Gueyam and
Maraconn, tugging at sharp oiled beards, smiled in anticipation, the fools. Semaradrid looked like a
man who had eaten an entire bowl of bad plums; Gregorin and the three lords of the Nine with him
merely wore grim determination on their faces. Not fools. “The scouts saw no signs of sul’dam or
damane,” Rand went on, “but even without them, even with Asha’man, that’s enough to kill a lot of us
if anybody forgets the plan. No one will forget, though, I’m sure.” No charges without orders, this
time. He had made that clear as glass, and hard as stone. No haring off because you thought maybe
you just might have seen something, either.
Weiramon smiled, managing to put as much oil into it as Sunamon ever could.
It was a simple plan, in its way. They would advance west in five columns, each with Asha’man,
and attempt to fall on the Seanchan from every side at once. Or as close to all sides as could be
managed. Simple plans were best, Bashere insisted. If you won’t be satisfied with a whole litter of
fat piglets, he had muttered, if you have to rush into the woods to find the old sow, then don’t get
too fancy, or she’ll gut you.
No plan of battle survives first contact, Lews Therin said in Rand’s head. For a moment, he
still seemed lucid. For a moment. Something is wrong, he growled suddenly. His voice began to gain
intensity, and drift into wild disbelieving laughter. It can’t be wrong, but it is. Something strange,
something wrong, skittering, jumping, twitching. His cackles turned to weeping. It can’t be! I must
be mad! And he vanished before Rand could mute him. Burn him, there was nothing wrong with the
plan, or Bashere would have been on it like a duck on a beetle.
Lews Therin was mad, no doubt of it. But so long as Rand al’Thor remained sane. . . . A bitter
joke on the world, if the Dragon Reborn went mad before the Last Battle even began. “Take your
places,” he commanded with a wave of the Dragon Scepter. He had to fight down the urge to laugh at
that joke.
The large clump of nobles broke apart at his order, milling and muttering as they sorted
themselves out. Few liked the way Rand had divided them up. Whatever breaking down of barriers
had occurred in the shock of the first fight in the mountains, they had sprung up again almost
immediately.
Weiramon frowned over his undelivered speech, but after an elaborate bow that thrust his beard
at Rand like a spear he rode north over the hills followed by Kiril Drapaneos, Bertome, Doressin,

and several minor Cairhienin lords, every last one of them stony-faced at a Tairen being placed over
them. Gedwyn rode by Weiramon’s side almost as if he were the one leading, and got dark scowls for
it that he affected not to notice. The other groupings were as mixed. Gregorin also headed north, with
a sullen Sunamon trying to pretend he was heading in the same direction by happenstance, and
Dalthanes leading lesser Cairhienin behind. Jeordwyn Semaris, another of the Nine, followed
Bashere south with Amondrid and Gueyam. Those three had accepted the Saldaean almost eagerly for
the simple reason that he was not Tairen, or Cairhienin, or Illianer, depending on the man. Rochaid
seemed to be trying the same with Bashere that Gedwyn was with Weiramon, but Bashere appeared
to ignore it. A little way from Bashere’s party, Torean and Maraconn rode with their heads together,
likely venting spleen at having Semaradrid placed over them. For that matter, Ershin Netari kept
glancing toward Jeordwyn, and standing in his stirrups to look back toward Gregorin and Kiril,
though it was improbable he could see them any longer past the hills. Semaradrid, his back iron-rod
straight, looked as unflappable as Bashere.
It was the same principle Rand had used all along. He trusted Bashere, and he thought he might
be able to trust Gregorin, and none of the others could dare think of turning against him with so many
outlanders around him, so many old enemies and so few friends. Rand laughed softly, watching them
all ride off from his hillside. They would fight for him, and fight well, because they had no other
choice. Any more than he had.
Madness, Lews Therin hissed. Rand shoved the voice away angrily.
He was hardly alone, of course. Tihera and Marcolin had most of the Defenders and
Companions mounted in ranks among the olive trees on hills flanking the one where he sat his horse.
The rest were out as a screen against surprise. A company of blue-coated Legionmen waited patiently
in the hollow below under Masond’s eye, and at their rear, as many men in what they had worn
surrendering on the heath back in Illian. They were trying to emulate the Legionmen’s calm—the other
Legionmen, now—trying without a great deal of success.
Rand glanced at Ailil and Anaiyella. The Tairen woman gave him a simpering smile, but it
faltered weakly. The Cairhienin woman’s face was frost. He could not forget them, or Denharad and
their armsmen. His column, in the center, would be the largest, and the strongest by a fair margin. A
very fair margin.
Flinn and the men Rand had chosen out after Dumai’s Wells rode up the hill toward him. The
balding old man always led, though all save Adley and Narishma now wore the Dragon as well as the
Sword, and Dashiva had worn it first. In part it was because the younger men deferred to Flinn, with
his long experience as a banner-man in the Andoran Queen’s Guards. In part it was because Dashiva
did not seem to care. He only appeared amused by the others. When he could spare time from talking
to himself, that was. Most often, he hardly seemed aware of anything past his own nose.
For that reason, it was something of a shock when Dashiva awkwardly booted his slab-sided
mount ahead of the rest. That plain face, so often vague or bemused with the fellow’s own thoughts,
was fixed in a worried frown. It was more than something of a shock when he seized saidin as soon
as he reached Rand and wove a barrier around them against eavesdropping. Lews Therin did not
waste breath—if a disembodied voice had breath—on mutters about killing; he lurched for the
Source snarling wordlessly, tried to claw the Power away from Rand. And just as abruptly fell silent
and vanished.
“There’s something askew with saidin here, something amiss,” Dashiva said, sounding not at all
vague. In fact, he sounded . . . precise. And testy. A teacher lecturing a particularly dense pupil. He
even stabbed a finger at Rand. “I don’t know what it is. Nothing can twist saidin, and if it could be

twisted, we’d have felt it back in the mountains. Well, there was something there, yesterday, but so
small. . . . I feel it clearly here, though. Saidin is . . . eager. I know; I know. Saidin is not alive. But it
. . . pulses, here. It is difficult to control.”
Rand forced his hand to loosen its grip on the Dragon Scepter. He had always been sure Dashiva
was nearly as mad as Lews Therin himself. Usually the man maintained a better hold on himself,
though, however precariously. “I’ve been channeling longer than you, Dashiva. You’re just feeling the
taint more.” He could not soften his tone. Light, he could not go mad yet, and neither could they! “Get
to your place. We’ll be moving soon.” The scouts had to return soon. Even in this flatter country, even
limited to no farther than they could see, ten miles would not take long to cover, Traveling.
Dashiva made no move to obey. Instead, he opened his mouth angrily, then snapped it shut.
Shaking visibly, he drew a deep breath. “I am well aware how long you have channeled,” he said in
an icy, almost contemptuous voice, “but surely even you can feel it. Feel, man! I don’t like ‘strange’
applied to saidin, and I don’t want to die or . . . or be burned out because you’re blind! Look at my
ward! Look at it!”
Rand stared. Dashiva pushing himself forward was peculiar enough, but Dashiva in a temper?
And then he did look at the ward. Really look. The flows should have been as steady as the threads in
tight-woven canvas. They vibrated. The ward stood solid as it should be, but the individual threads of
the Power shimmered with faint movement. Morr had said saidin was strange near Ebou Dar, and for
a hundred miles around. They were closer than a hundred miles, now.
Rand made himself feel saidin. He was always aware of the Power—anything else meant death
or worse—yet he had become used to the struggle. He fought for life, but the fight had become as
natural as life. The struggle was life. He made himself feel that battle, his life. Cold to make stone
shatter into dust. Fire to make stone flash to vapor. Filth to make a rotten cesspit smell a garden in full
flower. And . . . a pulsing, like something quivering in his fist. This was not the sort of throbbing he
had felt in Shadar Logoth, when the taint on saidin had resonated with the evil of that place, and
saidin had pulsed with it. The vileness was strong, but steady here. It was saidin itself that seemed
full of currents and surges. Eager, Dashiva called it, and Rand could see why.
Down the slope, behind Flinn, Morr scrubbed a hand through his hair and looked around
uneasily. Flinn alternated shifting on his saddle and easing his sword in its scabbard. Narishma,
watching the sky for flying creatures, blinked too often. A muscle twitched in Adley’s cheek. Every
one of them displayed some sign of nervousness, and little wonder. Relief welled up in Rand. Not
madness after all.
Dashiva smiled, a twisted self-satisfied smile. “I cannot believe you didn’t notice before.”
There was very close to a sneer in his voice. “You’ve been holding saidin practically day and night
since we began this mad expedition. This is a simple ward, but it did not want to form, then it
snapped together like pulling out of my hands.”
The silver-blue slash of a gateway rotated open atop one of the bare hills, half a mile to the
west, and a Soldier pulled his horse through and mounted hurriedly, returning from the scout. Even at
a distance, Rand could make out the faint shimmer of the weaves surrounding the gateway before they
vanished. The rider had not reached the bottom of the hill before another gateway opened on the crest,
and then a third, a fourth, more, one after another, almost as fast as the preceding man could get out of
the way.
“But it did form,” Rand said. So had the scouts’ gateways. “If saidin is hard to control, it’s
always hard, and it still does what you want.” But why more difficult here? A question for another
time. Light, he wished Herid Fel were still alive; the old philosopher might have had an answer. “Get

back with the others, Dashiva,” he ordered, but the man stared at him in astonishment, and he had to
repeat himself before the fellow let the ward vanish, jerked his horse around without a salute and
thumped the animal back down the slope with his heels.
“Some trouble, my Lord Dragon?” Anaiyella simpered. Ailil merely looked at Rand with flat
eyes.
Seeing the first scout on the way toward Rand, the others fanned off to north and south, where
they would join one of the other columns. Finding them the old-fashioned way would be faster than
casting about with gateways. Drawing rein in front of Rand, Nalaam slapped fist to chest—did he
look a bit wild-eyed? No matter. Saidin still did what the man wielding it made it do. Nalaam saluted
and gave his report. The Seanchan were not encamped ten miles away, they were no more than five or
six distant, marching east. And they had sul’dam and damane by the score.
Rand issued his orders as Nalaam galloped away, and his column began moving west. The
Defenders and the Companions rode on either flank. The Legionmen marched at the rear, just behind
Denharad. A reminder to the noblewomen, and their armsmen, if they needed one. Anaiyella certainly
looked over her shoulder often enough, and Ailil’s refusal to was pointed. Rand formed the main
thrust of the column, Rand and Flinn and the others, just as it would be with the other columns.
Asha’man to strike, and men with steel to guard their backs while they killed. The sun still had a long
way to climb before midday. Nothing had changed to alter the plan.
Madness waits for some, Lews Therin whispered. It creeps up on others.
Miraj rode near the head of his army marching east along a muddy road that wound through hilly
olive groves and patchy forest. Not at the head. A full regiment, most Seanchan, rode between him
and the forward scouts. He had known generals who wanted to be at the very front. Most were dead.
Most had lost the battles they died in. Mud kept down dust, yet word of an army on the move ran like
wildfire on the Sa’las Plains, whatever the land. Here and there among the olive trees he spotted an
overturned wheelbarrow or an abandoned pruning hook, but the workers had vanished long since.
Luckily, they would avoid his opponents as much as they did him. With luck, lacking raken, his
opponents would not know he was on them until it was too late. Kennar Miraj did not like trusting to
luck.
Aside from under-officers ready to produce maps or copy orders and messengers ready to carry
them, he rode accompanied only by Abaldar Yulan, small enough to make his quite ordinary brown
gelding seem immense, a fiery man with the nails of his little fingers painted green who wore a black
wig to conceal his baldness, and Lisaine Jarath, a gray-haired woman from Seandar itself, whose
pale plump face and blue eyes were a study in serenity. Yulan was not calm; Miraj’s coal-dark
Captain of the Air often wore a scowl for the rules that seldom let him touch the reins of a raken
anymore, but today his frown went bone deep. The sky was clear, perfect weather for raken, but by
Suroth’s command, none of his fliers would be in the saddle today, not here. There were too few
raken with the Hailene to risk them unnecessarily. Lisaine’s calm troubled Miraj more. More than the
senior der’sul’dam under his command, she was a friend with whom he had shared many a cup of kaf
and many a game of stones. An animated woman, always bubbling over with enthusiasms and
amusement. And she was icy calm, as silent as any sul’dam he had tried to question.
Within his sight were twenty damane flanking the horsemen, each walking beside her sul’dam’s
mount. The sul’dam bobbed in their saddles, bending to pat a damane’s head, straightening only to
bend again to stroke her hair. The damane looked steady enough to his eye, but plainly the sul’dam
were on razor’s edge. And ebullient Lisaine rode silent as a stone.
A torm appeared ahead, racing down the column. Well off to the side, on the edge of the groves,

yet horses whickered and shied as the bronze-scaled creature flowed past. A trained torm would not
attack horses—at least not unless the killing frenzy overtook it, the reason torm were no good in
battle—but horses trained to be calm around torm were in as short supply as torm themselves.
Miraj sent a skinny under-lieutenant named Varek to fetch the morat’torm’s scouting report.
Afoot, and the Light consume whether Varek lost sei’taer. He would not waste time on Varek trying
to control a mount acquired locally. The man returned faster than he went and made a crisp bow,
beginning his report before his back was straight again.
“The enemy is less than five miles due east, my Lord Captain-General, marching in our
direction. They are deployed in five columns spaced approximately one mile apart.”
So much for luck. But Miraj had considered how he would attack forty thousand with only five
himself, and fifty damane. Quickly men were galloping with orders to deploy to meet an attempted
envelopment, and the regiments behind him began turning into the groves, sul’dam riding among them
with their damane.
Gathering his cloak against a sudden cold wind, Miraj noticed something that made him feel
colder still. Lisaine was watching the sul’dam vanish into the trees, too. And she had begun to sweat.
Bertome rode easily, letting the wind stream his cloak to one side, but he studied the forested
country ahead with a wariness he barely attempted to conceal. Of his four countrymen at his back,
only Doressin was truly skilled in the Game of Houses. That fool Tairen dog Weiramon was blind, of
course. Bertome glared at the puffed-up buffoon’s back. Weiramon rode well ahead of the rest in
deep conversation with Gedwyn, and if Bertome needed any further proof that the Tairen would smile
at what gagged a goat, it was how he tolerated that hot-eyed young monster. He noticed Kiril glancing
sideways at him, and reined his gray farther from the towering man. He had no particular enmity
toward the Illianer, but he did hate people looming over him. He could not wait to return to Cairhien,
where he did not have to be surrounded by ungainly giants. Kiril Drapeneos was not blind, though,
however over-tall. He had sent a dozen scouts forward, too. Weiramon had sent one.
“Doressin,” Bertome said softly, then, a little louder, “Doressin, you lump!”
The bony man gave a start in his saddle. Like Bertome, like the other three, he had shaved and
powdered the front of his head; the style of marking yourself like a soldier had become quite
fashionable. Doressin should have called him a toad in return, the way they had since boyhood, but
instead he heeled his gelding up beside Bertome’s and leaned close. He was worried, and letting it
show, his forehead furrowed deeply. “You realize the Lord Dragon means us to die?” he whispered,
glancing at the column trailing behind them. “Blood and fire, I only listened to Colavaere, but I have
known I was a dead man since he killed her.”
For a moment, Bertome eyed the column of armsmen, snaking back through the rolling hills. The
trees were more scattered here than ahead, but still enough to shield an attack until it was right on top
of you. The last olive grove lay nearly a mile behind. Weiramon’s men rode at the fore, of course, in
those ridiculous coats with their fat white-striped sleeves, and then Kiril’s Illianers in enough green
and red to shame Tinkers. His own people, decently clad in dark blue beneath their breastplates,
were still beyond his sight with Doressin’s and the others’, ahead only of the company of Legionmen.
Weiramon had seemed surprised that the foot kept up, though he had hardly set a difficult pace.
It was not really the armsmen Bertome glanced at, though. Seven men rode before even
Weiramon’s, seven men with hard faces and death-cold eyes, in black coats. One wore a pin in the
shape of a silver sword on his tall collar.
“An elaborate way to go about it,” he told Doressin dryly. “And I doubt al’Thor would have sent
those fellows with us, if we were just being fed into a sausage grinder.” Forehead still creased,

Doressin opened his mouth again, but Bertome said, “I need to talk to the Tairen.” He disliked seeing
his childhood friend this way. Al’Thor had unhinged him.
Absorbed in one another, Weiramon and Gedwyn did not hear him riding up on them. Gedwyn
was idly playing with his reins, his features cold with contempt. The Tairen was red-faced. “I don’t
care who you are,” he was saying to the black-coated man in a low, hard voice, spittle flying, “I
won’t take more risk without a command direct from the lips of—”
Abruptly the pair became aware of Bertome, and Weiramon’s mouth snapped shut. He glared as
if he wanted to kill Bertome. The Asha’man’s ever-present smile melted away. The wind gusted, cold
and sharp as clouds drifted across the sun, but no colder than Gedwyn’s sudden stare. With a small
shock Bertome realized the man also wanted to strike him dead on the spot.
Gedwyn’s icily murderous gaze did not change, but Weiramon’s face underwent a remarkable
transformation. The red faded slowly as he produced a smile in an instant, an oily smile with only a
trace of mocking condescension. “I’ve been thinking about you, Bertome,” he said heartily. “A pity
al’Thor strangled your cousin. With his own hands, I hear. Frankly, I was surprised you came when
he called. I’ve seen him watching you. I fear he plans something more . . . interesting . . . for you than
thrashing your heels on the floor while his fingers tighten on your throat.”
Bertome suppressed a sigh, and not only at the fool’s clumsiness. A good many thought to
manipulate him with Colavaere’s death. She had been his favorite cousin, but ambitious beyond
reason. Saighan had good claims to the Sun Throne, yet she could not have held it against the strength
of Riatin or Damodred either one, let alone both together, not without the open blessings of the White
Tower or the Dragon Reborn. Still, she had been his favorite. What did Weiramon want? Certainly
not what it seemed on the surface. Even this Tairen oaf was not that simple.
Before he could frame any response, a horseman came galloping toward them through the trees
ahead. A Cairhienin, and as he reined to a sudden halt in front of them, that made his horse sit back on
its haunches, Bertome recognized one of his own armsmen, a gap-toothed fellow with seamed scars
on both cheeks. Doile, he thought. From the Colchaine estates.
“My Lord Bertome,” the fellow panted, bowing hastily. “There are two thousand Taraboners
hard on my heels. And women with them! With lightning on their dresses!”
“Hard on his heels,” Weiramon murmured disparagingly. “We’ll see what my man has to say
when he gets back. I certainly don’t see any—!”
Sudden whoops in the near distance ahead cut him off, and the thunder of hooves, and then
quickly galloping lancers appeared, a flowing tide spreading through the trees. Straight toward
Bertome and the others.
Weiramon laughed. “Kill whoever you wish, wherever you wish, Gedwyn,” he said, drawing
sword with a flourish. “I use the methods I use, and that’s that!” Racing back toward his armsmen, he
waved the blade over his head shouting, “Saniago! Saniago and glory!” It was no surprise he did not
add a shout for his country to those for his House and his greatest love.
Spurring in the same direction, Bertome raised his own voice. “Saighan and Cairhien!” No need
for sword waving yet. “Saighan and Cairhien!” What had the man been after?
Thunder rumbled, and Bertome looked to the sky, perplexed. There were few more clouds than
earlier. No; Doile—Dalyn?—had mentioned those women. And then he forgot all about whatever the
fool Tairen wanted as steel-veiled Taraboners poured over the wooded hills toward him, the earth
blooming fire and the sky raining lightning ahead of them.
“Saighan and Cairhien!” he shouted.
The wind rose.

Horsemen clashed amid thick trees and heavy underbrush, where shadows hung heavily. The
light seemed to be failing, the clouds thickening overhead, but it was hard to say with the dense forest
canopy for a roof. Booming roars half-drowned the ring of steel on steel, the shouts of men, the
screams of horses. Sometimes the ground shook. Sometimes the enemy raised shouts.
“Den Lushenos! Den Lushenos and the Bees!”
Annallin! Rally to Annallin!”
“Haellin! Haellin! For the High Lord Sunamon!”
The last was the only cry Varek understood in the least, though he suspected any of the locals
who named themselves High Lords or Ladies might not be offered the chance to swear the Oath.
He jerked his sword free from where he had jammed it into his opponent’s armpit, just above the
breastplate, and let the pale little man topple. A dangerous fighter, until he made the mistake of
raising his blade too high. The man’s bay crashed off through the undergrowth, and Varek spared a
moment for regret. The animal looked better than the white-footed dun he was forced to ride. A
moment only, and then he was peering through the close-set trees, where it seemed vines dangled
from half the branches and bunches of some gray, feathery plant from nearly all.
Sounds of battle rose from every direction, but at first he could see nothing that moved. Then a
dozen Altaran lancers appeared at fifty paces, walking their horses and peering about carefully,
though the way they talked loudly among themselves more than justified the red slashes crisscrossing
their breastplates. Varek gathered his reins, meaning to take them in. An escort, even this
undisciplined rabble, might be the difference between the urgent message he carried reaching BannerGeneral Chianmai and not.
Black streaks flashed from among the trees, emptying Altaran saddles. Their horses dashed in
every direction as the riders fell, and then there were only a dozen corpses sprawled on the damp
carpet of dead leaves, at least one crossbow bolt jutting from every man. Nothing moved. Varek
shivered in spite of himself. Those foot in blue coats had seemed easy at first, with no pikes to stand
behind, but they never came into the open, hiding behind trees, in dips in the ground. They were not
the worst. He had been sure after the frantic retreat to the ships at Falme that he had seen the worse he
ever could see, the Ever Victorious Army in a rout. Not half an hour gone, though, he had seen a
hundred Taraboners face one lone man in a black coat. A hundred lancers against one, and the
Taraboners had been ripped to shreds. Literally ripped to shreds, men and horses simply exploding as
fast he could count; the slaughter had continued after the Taraboners turned to flee, went on so long as
one of them remained in sight. Perhaps it was really no worse than having the ground erupt beneath
your feet, but at least damane usually left enough of you to be buried.
He had been told by the last man he managed to speak to in these woods, a grizzled veteran from
home leading a hundred Amadician pikes, that Chianmai was in this direction. Ahead, he spotted
riderless horses tied to trees, and men afoot. Maybe they could give him further direction. And he
would give them the lash of his tongue for standing about while a battle raged.
When he rode in among them, he forgot tongue-lashings. He had found what he was looking for,
but not at all what he wanted to find. A dozen badly burned corpses lay in a row. One, his honeybrown face untouched, was recognizably Chianmai. The men on their feet were all Taraboners,
Amadicians, Altarans. Some of them were injured, too. The only Seanchan was a tight-faced sul’dam
soothing a weeping damane.
“What happened here?” Varek demanded. He did not think it was like these Asha’man to leave
survivors. Maybe the sul’dam had fought him off.
“Madness, my lord.” A hulking Taraboner shrugged away the man who was spreading ointment

down his seared left arm. The sleeve appeared to have been burned away clear to the fellow’s
breastplate, yet despite his burns, he did not grimace. His veil of steel mail hung by a corner from his
red-plumed conical helmet, baring a hard face with thick gray mustaches that nearly hid his mouth,
and his eyes were insultingly direct. “A group of Illianers, they fell on us without warning. At first,
all went well. They had none of the blackcoats with them. Lord Chianmai, he led us bravely, and the .
. . the woman . . . channeled lightnings. Then, just as the Illianers broke, the lightnings, they fell among
us, too.” He cut off with a significant look at the sul’dam.
She was on her feet in an instant, shaking her free fist and striding as far toward the Taraboner as
the leash attached to her other wrist would allow. Her damane lay in a weeping heap. “I will not hear
this dog’s words against my Zakai! She is a good damane! A good damane!”
Varek made soothing gestures to the woman. He had seen sul’dam make their charges howl for
misdeeds, and a few who crippled the recalcitrant, but most would bristle even at one of the Blood
who cast aspersions on a favorite. This Taraboner was not of the Blood, and by the look of the
quivering sul’dam, she was ready to do murder. Had the man voiced his ridiculous, unspoken charge,
Varek thought she might have killed him on the spot.
“Prayers for the dead must wait,” Varek said bluntly. What he was about to do would end with
him in the hands of the Seekers, if he failed, but there was not a Seanchan left standing here except the
sul’dam. “I am assuming command. We will disengage and turn south.”
“Disengage!” the heavy-shouldered Taraboner barked. “It will take us days to disengage! The
Illianers, they fight like badgers backed into a corner, the Cairhienin like ferrets in a box. The
Tairens, they are not so hard as I have heard, but there are maybe a dozen of these Asha’man, yes? I
do not even know where three-quarters of my men are, in this jolly-bag!” Emboldened by his
example, the others began giving protest, too.
Varek ignored them. And forbore asking what a “jolly-bag” was; looking at the tangled forest all
around, listening to the clash of battle, the booms of explosions and lightnings, he could imagine.
“You will gather your men and begin pulling back,” he said loudly, cutting through their chatter. “Not
too fast; you will act in unison.” Miraj’s orders to Chianmai said “with all possible speed”—he had
memorized them, in case something happened to the copy in his saddlebags—“all possible speed,”
but too much speed in this, and half the men would be left behind, chopped to flinders at the enemy’s
leisure. “Now, move! You fight for the Empress, may she live forever!”
That last was the sort of thing you told fresh recruits, but for some reason, the listening men
jerked as if he had struck them all with his quirt. Bowing quickly and deeply, hands on knees, they all
but flew to their horses. Strange. Now it was up to him to find the Seanchan units. One of those would
be commanded by someone above him, and he could pass his responsibility.
The sul’dam was on her knees, stroking her still weeping damane’s hair and crooning softly.
“Get her soothed down,” he told her. With all possible speed. And he thought he had seen a touch of
anxiety in Miraj’s eyes. What could make Kennar Miraj anxious? “I think we will be depending on
you sul’dam to the south.” Now, why would that make the blood drain from her face?
Bashere stood just inside the edge of the trees, frowning through his helmet’s face-bars at what
he saw. His bay nuzzled his shoulder. He held his cloak close against the wind. More to avoid any
motion that would draw eyes than for the cold, though that chilled his flesh. It would have been a
spring breeze back in Saldaea, but months in the southlands had softened him. Shining bright between
gray clouds that sailed along quickly, the sun still lay a little short of midday. And ahead of him. Just
because you began a battle facing west did not mean you ended it that way. Before him lay a broad
pasture where flocks of black-and-white goats cropped at the brown grass in desultory fashion just as

if there was no battle raging all around them. Not that there was any sign of it here. For the moment. A
man could get himself cut to doll rags crossing that meadow. And in the trees, whether forest or olive
groves or thickets, you did not always see the enemy before you were on top of him, scouts or no
scouts.
“If we’re going to cross,” Gueyam muttered, rubbing a wide hand over his bald head, “we
should cross. Light’s truth, we’re wasting time.” Amondrid snapped his mouth shut; likely, the moonfaced Cairhienin had been about to say much the same thing. He would agree with a Tairen when
horses climbed trees.
Jeordwyn Semaris snorted. The man should have grown a beard to hide that narrow jaw. It made
his head look like a forester’s splitting wedge. “I do say go around,” he muttered. “I’ve lost enough
men to those Light-cursed damane, and . . .” He trailed off with an uneasy glance toward Rochaid.
The young Asha’man stood by himself, mouth tight, fingering that Dragon pin on his collar.
Maybe wondering whether it was worth it, by the look of him. There was no knowing air about the
boy now, only frowning worry.
Leading Quick by the reins, Bashere strode to the Asha’man and drew him farther aside in the
trees. Pushed him farther aside. Rochaid scowled, going reluctantly. The man was tall enough to loom
over Bashere, but Bashere was having none of it.
“Can I count on your people next time?” Bashere demanded, jerking a mustache in irritation. “No
delays?” Rochaid and his fellows seemed to have grown slower and slower responding when they
found themselves opposite damane.
“I know what I’m about, Bashere,” Rochaid snarled. “Aren’t we killing enough of them for you?
As far as I can see, we’re about done!”
Bashere nodded slowly. Not in agreement with the last. There were plenty of enemy soldiers
left, almost anywhere you looked hard enough. But a good many were dead. He had patterned his
movements on what he had studied of the Trolloc Wars, when the forces of the Light seldom came
anywhere near the numbers they had to face. Slash at the flanks, and run. Slash at the rear, and run.
Slash, and run, and when the enemy chased after, turn on the ground you had chosen beforehand,
where the legionmen lay waiting with their crossbows, turn and cut at him until it was time to run
again. Or until he broke. Already today he had broken Taraboners, Amadicians, Altarans and these
Seanchan in their strange armor. He had seen more enemy dead than in any fight since the Blood
Snow. But if he had Asha’man, the other side had those damane. A good third of his Saldaeans lay
dead along the miles behind. Nearly half his force was dead, all told, and there were still more
Seanchan out there with their cursed women, and Taraboners, and Amadicians and Altarans. They
just kept coming, more appearing as soon as he finished the last. And the Asha’man were growing . . .
hesitant.
Swinging into Quick’s saddle, he rode back to Jeordwyn and the others. “We go around,” he
ordered, ignoring Jeordwyn’s nods as much as he did Gueyam and Amondrid’s scowls. “Triple
scouts out. I mean to push hard, but I don’t want to trip over a damane.” No one laughed.
Rochaid had gathered the other five Asha’man around him, one with a silver sword pinned to his
collar, the others without. There had been two more with bare collars when they started out that
morning, but if Asha’man knew how to kill, so did damane. Waving his arms angrily, Rochaid
appeared to be arguing with them. His face was red, theirs blank and stubborn. Bashere just hoped
Rochaid could keep all of them from deserting. Today had been costly enough without adding that sort
of man wandering about loose.
A light rain fell. Rand scowled at the thick black clouds gathering the sky, already beginning to

obscure a pale sun halfway down to the far horizon. Light rain now, but it would thicken like those
clouds! Irritably he returned to studying the land ahead of him. The Crown of Swords pricked his
temples. With the Power in him, the land was clear as a map despite the weather. Clear enough,
anyway. Hills sinking away, some covered with thickets or olive trees, others bare grass or just stone
and weeds. He thought he saw movement at the edge of a copse, then again among the rows of an
olive orchard on another hill a mile from the copse. Thinking was not enough. Dead men lay across
the miles behind, dead enemies. Dead women, too, he knew, but he had stayed away from anywhere
sul’dam and damane had died, refused to see their faces. Most thought it was hatred for those who
killed so many of his followers.
Tai’daishar frisked a few steps on the hilltop before Rand settled him with a firm hand and the
pressure of his knees. A fine thing if a sul’dam spotted his movement. The few trees around him were
not enough to hide much. Vaguely, he realized he did not recognize a one of them. Tai’daishar tossed
his head. Rand tucked the Dragon Scepter into his saddlebags, just the carved butt end sticking out, to
free both hands in case the gelding was not satisfied. He could have taken weariness from the horse
with saidin, but he knew no way to make it obey with the Power.
He could not see how the gelding retained enough energy. Saidin filled him, bubbled in him, but
his distantly felt body wanted to sag with weariness. Part of that was the sheer amount of the Power
he had handled today. Part was the strain of fighting saidin to make it do what he wanted. Always,
saidin had to be conquered, forced, but never before like today. The half-healed, never-healing
wounds in his left side were agony, the older an auger trying to drill through the Void, the newer a
blaze of raw flame.
“It was an accident, my Lord Dragon,” Adley said suddenly. “I swear it was!”
“Shut up and watch!” Rand told him harshly. Adley’s eyes sank to his hands on his own reins for
a moment, then he raked damp hair out of his face and jerked his head up obediently.
Today, here, controlling saidin was harder than ever, but letting it slip anytime, anywhere, could
kill you. Adley had let it slip, and men had died in uncontrolled bursts of fire, not just the Amadicians
he had been aiming at, but near thirty of Ailil’s armsmen and almost as many of Anaiyella’s.
Except for his slip, Adley would have been with Morr, with the Companions in the woods half a
mile to the south. Narishma and Hopwil were with the Defenders, to the north. Rand wanted Adley
under his eye. Had any other “accidents” happened, out of his sight? He could not watch everyone, all
the time. Flinn’s face was grim as day-old death, and Dashiva, far from looking vague, seemed on the
point of sweating with concentration. He still muttered to himself under his breath, so low Rand could
not hear even with the Power in him, but the man mopped rain from his face continually with a sodden
lace-edged linen handkerchief that had grown more than grimy as the day wore on. Rand did not think
they had slipped. In any case, neither they nor Adley held the Power now. Nor would until he
instructed them to seize it.
“Is it done?” Anaiyella asked behind him.
Heedless of who might be watching out there, Rand wheeled Tai’daishar around to face her. The
Tairen woman started back in her saddle, the hood of her richly elaborate rain cape falling to her
shoulders. Her cheek gave a twitch. Her eyes might have been full of fear, or hate. At her side, Ailil
fingered her reins calmly with red-gloved hands.
“What more can you want?” the smaller woman asked in a cool voice. A lady being polite to a
menial. Barely. “If the size of a victory is accounted by dead enemies, I think today alone will put
your name in the histories.”
“I mean to drive the Seanchan into the sea!” Rand snapped. Light, he had to finish them now,

when he had the chance! He could not fight the Seanchan and the Forsaken and the Light alone knew
who or what else, all at the same time! “I did it before, and I will again!”
Do you have the Horn of Valere hidden in your pocket this time? Lews Therin asked slyly.
Rand snarled at him silently.
“There’s someone below,” Flinn said suddenly. “Riding up this way. From the west.”
Rand pulled his mount back around. Legionmen ringed the slopes of the hill, though they hid well
enough that he seldom caught sight of a blue coat. None of them had a horse. Who would be riding . . .
Bashere’s bay trotted up the slope almost as though it were level ground. Bashere’s helmet hung
from his saddle, and the man himself looked tired. Without preamble, he spoke in a flat voice. “We’re
finished, here. Part of fighting is knowing when to go, and it’s time. I’ve left five hundred dead
behind, near enough, and two of your Soldiers for salt. I sent three more to find Semaradrid, Gregorin
and Weiramon and tell them to rally on you. I doubt they’re in any better condition than I am. How
does your butcher’s bill run?”
Rand ignored the question. His own dead topped Bashere’s by close to two hundred. “You had
no right sending orders to the others. So long as there are half a dozen Asha’man left—so long as
there’s me!—I have enough! I mean to find the rest of the Seanchan army and destroy it, Bashere. I
won’t let them add Altara to Tarabon and Amadicia.”
Bashere knuckled his thick mustaches with a wry laugh. “You want to find them. Look out there.”
He swept a gauntleted hand across the hills to the west. “I can’t point to a particular spot, but there
are ten, maybe fifteen thousand close enough to see from here, if those trees weren’t in the way. I
danced with the Dark One getting through them unseen to reach you. Maybe a hundred damane down
there. Maybe more. More coming, for sure, and more men. Seems their general has decided to
concentrate on you. I suppose it isn’t always cheese and ale being ta’veren.”
“If they’re out there . . .” Rand scanned the hills. The rain fell more heavily. Where had he seen
movement? Light, he was tired. Saidin hammered at him. Unconsciously he touched the wrapped
bundled beneath his stirrup leather. His hand jerked away of its own accord. Ten thousand, even
fifteen . . . Once Semaradrid reached him, and Gregorin, and Weiramon . . . More important, once the
rest of the Asha’man did . . . “If they’re out there, that’s where I’ll destroy them, Bashere. I’ll hit them
from all sides, the way we intended in the first place.”
Frowning, Bashere reined his horse closer, until his knee almost touched Rand’s. Flinn moved
his mount away, but Adley was too focused on staring through the rain to notice anything so near, and
Dashiva, still wiping his face incessantly, stared with open interest. Bashere lowered his voice to a
murmur. “You aren’t thinking straight. That was a good plan, in the beginning, but their general thinks
fast. He spread out to blunt our attacks before we could fall on him spread out marching. We’ve cost
him even so, it seems, and he now he’s pulling everything together. You won’t catch him by surprise.
H e wants us to come at him. He’s out there waiting for it. Asha’man or no Asha’man, if we stand
nose-to-nose with this fellow, I think maybe the vultures grow fat and nobody rides away.”
“Nobody stands nose-to-nose with the Dragon Reborn,” Rand growled. “The Forsaken could tell
him that, whoever he is. Right, Flinn? Dashiva?” Flinn nodded uncertainly. Dashiva flinched. “You
think I can’t surprise him, Bashere? Watch!” Pulling the long bundle loose, he stripped away the cloth
covering, and Rand heard gasps as raindrops glistened on a sword seemingly made of crystal. The
Sword That Is Not a Sword. “Let’s see if he’s surprised byCallandor in the hands of the Dragon
Reborn, Bashere.”
Cradling the translucent blade in the crook of his elbow, Rand rode Tai’daishar forward a few
steps. There was no reason to. He had no clearer view from there. Except . . . Something spidered

across the outer surface of the Void, a wriggling black web. He was afraid. The last time he had used
Callandor, really used it, he had tried to bring the dead back to life. He had been sure he could do
anything, then, anything at all. Like a madman thinking he could fly. But he was the Dragon Reborn.
He could do anything. Had he not proved it time and again? He reached for the Source through the
Sword That Is Not a Sword.
Saidin seemed to leap into Callandor before he touched the Source through it. From pommel to
point, the crystal sword shone with a white light. He had only thought the Power filled him before.
Now he held more than ten men could have unaided, a hundred, he did not know how many. The fires
of the sun, searing through his head. The cold of all of the winters of all the Ages, eating into his
heart. In that torrent, the taint was all the midden heaps in the world emptying into his soul. Saidin
still tried to kill him, tried to scour away, burn away, freeze away, every scrap of him, but he fought,
and he lived for a moment more, and another moment, another. He wanted to laugh. He could do
anything!
Once, holding Callandor, he had made a weapon that searched out Shadowspawn through the
Stone of Tear, struck them dead with hunting lightning wherever they stood or ran or hid. Surely there
must be something like that, to use against his enemies here. But when he called to Lews Therin, only
anguished whimpers answered, as if that disembodied voice feared the pain of saidin.
With Callandor blazing in his hand—he did not remember raising the blade overhead—he
stared at the hills where his enemies hid. They were gray now, with thickening rain, and dense black
clouds blocking the sun. What was it he had told Eagan Padros?
“I am the storm,” he whispered—a shout in his ears, a roar—and he channeled.
Overhead, the clouds boiled. Where they had been the black of soot, they became midnight, the
heart of midnight. He did not know what he was channeling. So often, he did not, in spite of
Asmodean’s teaching. Maybe Lews Therin was guiding him, in spite of the man’s weeping. Flows of
saidin spun across the sky, Wind and Water and Fire. Fire. The sky truly did rain lightning. A hundred
bolts at once, hundreds, forked blue-white shafts stabbing down as far as he could see. The hills
before him erupted. Some flew apart under the torrent of lightning like kicked anthills. Flames sprang
up in thickets, trees turning to torches in the rain, flames racing through olive orchards.
Something struck him hard, and he realized he was picking himself up from the ground. The
crown had fallen from his head. Callandor still blazed in his hand, though. Vaguely, he was aware of
Tai’daishar scrambling to his feet, trembling. So they thought to strike back at him, did they.
Shoving Callandor high, he screamed at them. “Come against me, if you dare! I am the storm!
Come if you dare, Shai’tan! I am the Dragon Reborn!” A thousand sizzling lightning bolts hailed down
from the clouds.
Again something struck him down. He tried to fight up again. Callandor, still shining, lay a pace
from his outstretched hand. The sky shattered with lightnings. Suddenly, he realized that the weight
atop him was Bashere, that the man was shaking him. It must have been Bashere who had flung him
down!
“Stop it!” the Saldaean shouted. Blood fanned down his face from a split across his scalp.
“You’re killing us, man! Stop!”
Rand turned his head, and one stunned look was enough. Lightnings flashed all around him, in
every direction. A bolt stabbed down onto the reverse slope, where Denharad and the armsmen were;
the screams of men and horses rose. Anaiyella and Ailil were both afoot, trying vainly to quiet mounts
that reared, eyes rolling, trying to rip reins free. Flinn was bending over someone, not far from a dead
horse with legs already stiff.

Rand let saidin go. He let it go, but for moments it still flowed into him, and lightning raged. The
flow into him dwindled, tailed off and vanished. Dizziness swept through him in its place. For three
more heartbeats, two of Callandor shone where they lay on the ground, and lightning fell. Then,
silence except for the rising drum of the rain. And the screams from behind the hill.
Slowly Bashere climbed off of him, and Rand rose unaided on tottering legs, blinking as his
sight returned to normal. The Saldaean watched him as he might have a rabid lion, fingering his
sword hilt. Anaiyella took one look at Rand on his feet and collapsed in a faint; her horse dashed
away, reins dangling. Ailil, still fighting her rearing animal, spared few glances for Rand. Rand let
Callandor lie where it was for the moment. He was not sure he dared pick it up. Not yet.
Flinn straightened, shaking his head, then stood silently as Rand went unsteadily to stand beside
him. The rain fell on Jonan Adley’s sightless eyes, bulging as if in horror. Jonan had been one of the
first. Those screams from behind the hill seemed to slice through the rain. How many more, Rand
wondered. Among the Defenders? The Companions? Among . . . ?
Rain thick as a blanket hid the hills where the Seanchan army lay. Had he hurt them at all,
striking out blindly? Or were they still waiting out there with all their damane? Waiting to see how
many more of his own he could kill for them.
“Set whatever guard you think we need,” Rand told Bashere. His voice was iron. One of the
first. His heart was iron. “When Gregorin and the others reach us, we’ll Travel to where the carts are
waiting as fast as we can.” Bashere nodded without speaking, and turned away in the rain.
I’ve lost, Rand thought dully. I’m the Dragon Reborn, but for the first time, I’ve lost.
Suddenly, Lews Therin raged up inside him, sly digs forgotten. I’ve never been defeated, he
snarled. I am the Lord of the Morning! No one can defeat me!
Rand sat in the rain, turning the Crown of Swords in his hands, looking at Callandor lying in the
mud. He let Lews Therin rage.
Abaldar Yulan wept, grateful for the downpour that hid the tears on his cheeks. Someone would
have to give the order. Eventually someone would have to apologize to the Empress, might she live
forever, and maybe to Suroth sooner. Those were not why he wept, though, nor even for a dead
comrade. Roughly ripping a sleeve from his coat, he laid it across Miraj’s staring eyes so the rain
would not fall in them.
“Send out orders for retreat,” Yulan ordered, and saw the men standing around him jerk. For the
second time on these shores, the Ever Victorious Army had suffered a devastating defeat, and Yulan
did not think he was the only one who wept.

An Unwelcome Return

S eated behind her gilded writing table, Elaida fingered an age-dark ivory carving of a strange
bird with a beak as long as its body and listened with some amusement to the six women
standing on the other side on the table. Each a Sitter for her Ajah, they frowned sideways at one
another, shifted velvet slippers on the brightly patterned carpet that covered most of the russet
floor tiles, twitched at vine-worked shawls so the colored fringes danced, and generally looked
and sounded like a gaggle of peevish serving girls wishing they had the nerve to go for each
others’ throats in front of their mistress. Frost coated the glassed casements fitted into the
windows so that it was hardly possible to see the snow swirling outside, though sometimes the
winds howled with an icy rage. Elaida felt quite warm, and not just for the thick logs blazing in
the white marble fireplace. Whether these women knew it or not—well, Duhara knew, certainly,
and perhaps the others did—she was their mistress. The elaborate gold-covered case clock that
Cemaile had commissioned ticked away. Cemaile’s vanished dream would come true; The
Tower returned to its glory. And firmly in the capable hands of Elaida do Avriny a’Roihan.
“No ter’angreal has ever been found that can ‘control’ a woman’s channeling,” Velina was
saying in a voice cool and precise but almost girlishly high-pitched, a voice at strong odds with her
eagle’s beak of a nose and her sharp, tilted eyes. She sat for the White, and was the very model of a
White sister, in all but her fierce appearance. Her plain, snowy dress seemed stark and cold. “Very
few have ever been found that perform the same function. Therefore, logically, if such a ter’angreal
were found, or more than one, improbable as that must be, there could not be sufficient of them to
control more than two or three women at most. It follows that the reports of these so-called Seanchan
are exaggerated wildly. If women on ‘leashes’ exist, they cannot channel. Plainly not. I do not deny
these people hold Ebou Dar, and Amador, and perhaps more, but clearly they are but a creation of
Rand al’Thor, perhaps to frighten people into flocking to him. Like this Prophet of his. It is simple
logic.”
“I am very glad you don’t deny Amador and Ebou Dar at least, Velina,” Shevan said drily. And
she could be very dry indeed. As tall as most men, and bonily thin with it, the Brown Sitter had an
angular face and a long chin, not improved by a cap of curls. With spidery fingers she rearranged her
shawl and smoothed skirts of dark golden silk, and her voice took on pointed amusement. “I’m

uncomfortable saying what can and can’t be. For example, not long gone, everyone ‘knew’ only a
shield woven by a sister could stop a woman channeling. Then comes a simple herb, forkroot, and
anyone at all can feed you a tea that leaves you unable as a stone to channel for hours. Useful with
unruly wilders or the like, I suppose, but a nasty little surprise for those who think they knew
everything, eh? Maybe next, someone will learn to make ter’angreal again.”
Elaida’s mouth tightened. She did not concern herself with impossibilities, and if no sister had
managed to rediscover the making of ter’angreal in three thousand years, one never would and that
was that. It was knowledge slipping through her fingers when she wanted it held close that curled
Elaida’s tongue. In spite of all her efforts, every last initiate in the Tower had learned of forkroot,
now. No one liked knowing in the least. No one liked suddenly being vulnerable to anyone with a
knowledge of herbs and a little hot water. That knowledge was worse than poison, as the Sitters here
made clear.
At mention of the herb, Duhara’s big, dark eyes grew uneasy in her coppery face, and she held
herself more stiffly than usual, hands clutching skirts so red they seemed nearly black. Sedore actually
swallowed, and her fingers tightened on the worked leather folder Elaida had handed her, though the
round-faced Yellow usually carried herself with a frosty elegance. Andaya shivered! She actually
wrapped her gray-fringed shawl around her convulsively.
Elaida wondered what they would do if they learned the Asha’man had rediscovered Traveling.
As it was, they were barely able to make themselves speak of them. At least she had managed to hold
that knowledge to a handful.
“I think we might better concern ourselves with what we know to be true, yes?” Andaya said
firmly, back in control of herself. Her light brown hair, brushed till it gleamed, hung flowing down
her back, and her silver-slashed blue dress was cut in the style of Andor, but Tarabon still rested
strongly on her tongue. Though neither particularly small nor particularly slim, she somehow always
reminded Elaida of a sparrow about to hop on a branch. A most unlikely-appearing negotiator, though
her reputation had been earned. She smiled at the others, not very pleasantly, and that seemed
sparrowlike, too. Perhaps it was how she held her head. “Idle speculation, it wastes precious time.
The world hangs by a thread, and myself, I do not wish to fritter away valuable hours prattling about
supposed logic or chattering over what every fool and novice knows. Does anyone have anything
useful to say?” For a sparrow, she could put acid on her words. Velina’s face went red, and Shevan’s
darkened.
Rubinde twisted her lips at the Gray. Perhaps they were meant to make a smile, but they merely
seemed to writhe. With raven-black hair and eyes like sapphires, the Mayener usually looked as if
she intended to walk through a stone wall, and planting her fists on her hips now, she seemed ready to
walk through two. “We’ve dealt with what we can for the time being, Andaya. Most of it, anyway.
The rebels are caught by the snows in Murandy, and we’ll make winter hot enough for them that in the
spring they’ll come crawling back to apologize and beg penance. Tear will be taken care of as soon
as we find where the High Lord Darlin has vanished to, and Cairhien once we root Caraline
Damodred and Toram Riatin out of their hiding places. Al’Thor has the crown of Illian for the
moment, but that’s in work. So, unless you have a scheme for snaffling the man into the Tower or
making these so-called Asha’man’ vanish, I have the business of my Ajah to be about.”
Andaya drew herself up, her feathers well and truly ruffled. For that matter, Duhara’s eyes
narrowed; mention of men who could channel always lit fires in her head. Shevan clicked her tongue
as if at children squabbling—though she looked pleased to see it—and Velina frowned, for some
reason sure Shevan had aimed at her. This was amusing, but getting out of hand.

“The business of the Ajahs is important, daughters.” Elaida did not raise her voice, but every
head swiveled toward her. She replaced the ivory carving with the rest of her collection in the large
box covered with roses and golden scrolls, carefully adjusted the positions of her writing case and
correspondence box so the three lacquered boxes lined up just so on the table, and once their silence
was perfect she went on. “The business of the Tower is more important, though. I trust you will effect
my decrees promptly. I see too much sloth in the Tower. I fear Silviana may find herself very busy if
matters do not come right soon.” She did not voice any further threat. She merely smiled.
“As you command, Mother,” murmured six voices not so steady as their owners might have
wished. Even Duhara’s face was pasty pale as they made their curtsies. Two Sitters had been
stripped of their chairs, and half a dozen had served days of Labor for penance—which was
humiliating enough in their position to be Mortification of the Spirit besides; Shevan and Sedore
certainly wore tight mouths as they remembered all too well scrubbing floors and working in the
laundries—but none had been sent to Silviana for Mortification of the Flesh. No one wanted to be.
The Mistress of Novices had two or three visits each week from sisters who been given penance by
their Ajahs or set one for themselves—a dose of the strap, however painful, was done with much
more quickly than raking garden paths for a month—but Silviana possessed considerably less mercy
with sisters than with the novices and Accepted in her charge. More than one sister must have spent
the next few days wondering whether a month pulling a rake might not have been preferable after all.
They scurried toward the doors, eager to be away. Sitters or no, not one would have set foot this
high in the Tower without Elaida’s direct summons. Fingering her striped stole, Elaida let her smile
become one of pleasure. Yes, she was the mistress in the White Tower. As was only proper for the
Amyrlin Seat.
Before that fast-stepping knot of Sitters reach the doorway, the left-hand door opened, and
Alviarin stepped in, the narrow white stole of the Keeper almost vanishing against a silk dress that
made Velina’s seem dingy.
Elaida felt her smile go crooked and begin sliding from her face. Alviarin had a single sheet of
parchment in one slim hand. Odd, what one noticed at a time like this. The woman had been gone
almost two weeks, vanished from the Tower without word or note, without anyone so much as seeing
her go, and Elaida had begun to think fond thoughts of Alviarin lying in a snowbank, or swept away in
a river, sliding beneath the ice.
The six Sitters skidded to a halt uncertainly when Alviarin did not move out of their way. Even a
Keeper with Alviarin’s influence did not impede Sitters. Though Velina, normally the most selfpossessed woman in the Tower, flinched for some reason. Alviarin glanced once at Elaida, coolly,
studied the Sitters for a moment, and understood everything.
“I think you should leave that with me,” she said to Sedore in tones only a fraction warmer than
the snow outside. “The Mother likes to consider her decrees carefully, as you know. This would not
be the first time she changed her mind after signing.” She held out a slim hand.
Sedore, whose arrogance was notable even among Yellows, barely hesitated before giving her
the leather folder.
Elaida ground her teeth in fury. Sedore had hated her five days up to her elbows in hot water and
scrub boards. Elaida would find something less comfortable for her next time. Maybe Silviana after
all. Maybe cleaning the cesspits!
Alviarin stepped aside without a word, and the Sitters went, adjusting shawls, muttering to
themselves, reassuming the dignity of the Hall. Briskly, Alviarin closed the door behind them and
walked toward Elaida thumbing through the papers in the folder. The decrees she had signed hoping

Alviarin was dead. Of course, she had not rested on hope. She had not spoken to Seaine, in case
someone might see and tell Alviarin when she returned, but Seaine was certainly working away as
instructed, following the path of treason that surely would lead to Alviarin Freidhen. But Elaida had
hoped. Oh, how she had hoped.
Alviarin murmured to herself as she rifled the folder. “This can go through, I suppose. But not
this. Or this. And certainly not this!” She crumpled a decree, signed and sealed by the Amyrlin Seat,
and tossed it to the floor contemptuously. Stopping beside Elaida’s gilded chair, with the Flame of
Tar Valon in moonstones atop its high back, she slapped the folder and her own parchment down on
the table. And then slapped Elaida’s face so hard she saw black flecks.
“I thought we had settled this, Elaida.” The monstrous woman’s voice made the snowstorm
outside seem warm. “I know how to save the Tower from your blunders, and I won’t have you making
new ones behind my back. If you persist, be assured that I will see you deposed, stilled, and howling
under the birch before every initiate and even the servants!”
With an effort, Elaida kept her hand away from her cheek. She did not need a mirror to tell her it
was red. She had to be careful. Seaine had found nothing yet, or she would have come. Alviarin could
open her mouth before the Hall and reveal the whole disastrous kidnapping of the al’Thor boy. She
might see her deposed, and stilled and birched with that alone, but Alviarin had another string to her
bow. Toveine Gazal was leading fifty sisters and two hundred of the Tower Guard against a Black
Tower Elaida had been sure, when she gave the orders, held perhaps two or three men who could
channel. Yet even with the hundreds—hundreds! with Alviarin staring coldly down at her, that thought
still curdled Elaida’s stomach!—even with hundreds of these Asha’man, she had hope for Toveine.
The Black Tower would be rent in fire and blood, she had Foretold, and sisters would walk its
grounds. Surely that meant that somehow, Toveine would triumph. More, the rest of the Foretelling
had told her that the Tower would regain all its old glories under her, that al’Thor himself would
quail at her anger. Alviarin had heard the words coming out of Elaida’s mouth when the Foretelling
took her. And she had not remembered later, when she began her blackmail, had not understood her
own doom. Elaida waited in patience. She would repay the woman three-fold! But she could be
patient. For now.
Making no attempt to hide her sneer, Alviarin pushed the folder aside and moved the single
parchment in front of Elaida. She flipped open the green-and-gold writing case, dipped Elaida’s pen
in the inkwell and thrust it at her. “Sign.”
Elaida took the pen wondering what madness she would be putting her name to this time. Yet
another increase in the Tower Guard, when the rebels would be done before there was any use for
soldiers? Another attempt to make the Ajahs reveal publicly which sisters headed them? That had
certainly fallen on its nose! Reading quickly, she felt a knot of ice grow in her belly and keep
growing. Giving each Ajah final authority over any sister in its quarter no matter her own Ajah had
been the worst insanity so far—how could picking apart the very fabric of the Tower save it?—but
this—!
The world now knows that Rand al’Thor is the Dragon Reborn. The world knows that he is a
man who can touch the One Power. Such men have lain within the authority of the White
Tower since time immemorial. The Dragon Reborn is granted the protection of the Tower, but
whosoever attempts to approach him save through the White Tower lies attainted of treason
against the Light, and anathema is pronounced against them now and forever. The world may

rest easily knowing that the White Tower will safely guide the Dragon Reborn to the Last
Battle and the inevitable triumph.
Automatically, numbly, she added “of the Light” after “triumph,” but then her hand froze.
Publicly acknowledging al’Thor as the Dragon Reborn could be borne, since he was, and this might
lead many to accept the rumors that he had knelt to her already, which would prove useful, but for the
rest, she could not believe so much damage could be contained in so few words.
“The Light have mercy,” she breathed fervently. “If this is proclaimed, it will be impossible to
convince al’Thor that his abduction was unsanctioned.” It would be hard enough without, but she had
seen people convinced before that what had happened, had not, and them in the middle of it
happening. “And he will be ten times on his guard against another attempt. Alviarin, at best, this will
frighten away a few of his followers. At best!” Many likely had waded so deep with him they did not
dare try to wade back. Certainly not if they thought anathema already hung over their heads! “I might
as well set fire to the Tower with my own hand as sign this!”
Alviarin sighed impatiently. “You haven’t forgotten your catechism, have you? Say it for me, as I
taught you.”
Elaida’s lips compressed of their own accord. One pleasure in the woman’s absence—not the
greatest, but a very real pleasure—had been not being forced to repeat that vile litany every day. “I
will do as I am told,” she said at last, in a flat voice. She was the Amyrlin Seat! “I will speak the
words you tell me to speak, and no more.” Her Foretelling ordained her triumph, but, oh, Light, let it
come soon! “I will sign what you tell me to sign, and nothing else. I am . . .” She choked over the last.
“I am obedient to your will.”
“You sound as if you need to be reminded of the truth of that,” Alviarin said with another sigh. “I
suppose I’ve left you alone too long.” She tapped the parchment with a peremptory finger. “Sign.”
Elaida signed, dragging the pen across the parchment. There was nothing else she could do.
Alviarin barely waited for the pen’s nib to lift before snatching up the decree. “I will seal this
myself,” she said, heading for the door. “I shouldn’t have left the Amyrlin’s seal where you could find
it. I want to talk to you later. I have left you to yourself too long. Be here when I return.”
“Later?” Elaida said. “When? Alviarin? Alviarin?”
The door closed behind the woman, leaving Elaida to fume. Be there when Alviarin returned!
Confined to her quarters like a novice in the punishment cells!
For a time she fingered her correspondence box, with its golden hawks fighting among white
clouds in a blue sky, yet she could not make herself open it. With Alviarin gone, that box had begun
once more to hold letters and reports of importance, not just the table scraps Alviarin let fall to her,
yet with the woman’s return, it might as well have been empty. Rising, she began rearranging the
roses in their white vases, each atop a white marble plinth in a corner of the room. Blue roses; the
most rare.
Abruptly she realized that she was staring at a broken rose stem in her hands, snapped in two.
Half a dozen more littered the floor tiles. She made a vexed sound in her throat. She had been thinking
of her hands around Alviarin’s throat. It was not the first time she had considered killing the woman.
But Alviarin would have taken precautions. Sealed documents, to be opened should anything
untoward happen, had no doubt been left with the last sisters Elaida would suspect. That had been her
one real worry during Alviarin’s absence, that someone else might think the woman dead, and come
forward with the evidence that would drag the stole from her shoulders. Sooner or later, though, one
way or another, Alviarin was finished, as surely as those roses were—
“You didn’t answer my knock, Mother, so I came on in,” a woman said gruffly behind her.

Elaida turned, ready to flay with her tongue, but at the sight of the stocky, square-faced woman in
a red-fringed shawl standing just inside the room, the blood drained from her own cheeks.
“The Keeper said you wanted to speak me,” Silviana said irritably. “About a private penance.”
Even to the Amyrlin Seat, she made no effort to hide her disgust. Silviana believed private penance a
ridiculous affectation. Penance was public; only punishment took place in private. “She also asked
me to remind you of something, but she rushed off before saying what.” She finished with a snort.
Silviana saw anything that took time away from her novices and Accepted as needless interruption.
“I think I remember,” Elaida told her dully.
When Silviana finally left—after only half an hour by the chimes of Cemaile’s clock, yet an
endless eternity—all that kept Elaida from calling the Hall to sit immediately so she could demand
Alviarin be stripped of the Keeper’s stole were the certainty of her Foretelling and the certainty that
Seaine would trace that trail of treason back to Alviarin. That, and the sure fact that whether or not
Alviarin fell in the confrontation, she herself definitely would. So, Elaida do Avriny a’Roihan,
Watcher of the Seals, the Flame of Tar Valon, the Amyrlin Seat, surely the most powerful ruler in the
world, lay facedown on her bed and blubbered into her pillows, too tender to don the shift that lay
discarded on the floor, certain that when Alviarin returned, the woman would insist on her sitting
through the entire interview. She blubbered, and through her tears she prayed for Alviarin’s downfall
to come soon.
“I did not tell you to have Elaida . . . beaten,” that voice of crystal chimes said. “Do you rise
above yourself?”
Alviarin flung herself from her knees onto her belly before the woman who seemed made of dark
shadows and silvery light. Seizing the hem of Mesaana’s dress, she rained kisses on it. The weave of
Illusion—it must be that, though she could not see a single thread of saidar any more than she could
sense the ability to channel in the woman who stood over her—did not hold completely, with her
frantically shifting the skirt’s edge. Flickers of bronze silk with a thin border of intricately
embroidered black scrollwork showed through.
“I live to serve and obey you, Great Mistress,” Alviarin panted between kisses. “I know that I
am among the lowest of the low, a worm in your presence, and I pray only for your smile.” She had
been punished once for “rising above herself”—not for disobedience, thanks be to the Great Lord of
the Dark!—and she knew that whatever howls Elaida might be raising right then, they could not be
half so loud as her own had been.
Mesaana let the kissing go on for some time, and finally signaled an end by tipping Alviarin’s
face up with the toe of a slipper beneath the chin. “The decree has gone out.” It was not a question,
but Alviarin answered hastily.
“Yes, Great Mistress. Copies went to Northharbor and Southharbor even before I had Elaida
sign. The first couriers have gone, and no merchant will leave the city without copies to distribute.”
Mesaana knew all that, of course. She knew everything. A cramp tightened the back of Alviarin’s
awkwardly craned neck, but she did not move. Mesaana would tell her when to move. “Great
Mistress, Elaida is an empty husk. With all humility, would it not be better without the need to use
her?” She held her breath. Questions could be dangerous, with the Chosen.
A shadow-nailed silvery finger tapped silver lips pursed in an amused smile. “Better if you
wore the Amyrlin’s stole, child?” Mesaana said at last. “An ambition small enough to fit you, but all
in its time. For now, I have a tiny task for you. In spite of all the walls that have gone up between the
Ajahs, the heads of the Ajahs seem to encounter one another with surprising frequency. By chance,
they make it seem. All but the Red, at least; a pity Galina got herself killed, or she could tell you what

they are about. Very probably it is trivial, but you will learn why they bare teeth at one another in
public, then whisper together in private.”
“I hear and obey, Great Mistress,” Alviarin replied promptly, grateful that Mesaana considered
it unimportant. The great “secret” of who headed the Ajahs was none to her—every Black sister was
required to relay to the Supreme Council every whisper inside her supposed Ajah—but only Galina
among them had been Black. That meant querying the Black sisters among the Sitters, which meant
going through all the layers between them and her. That would take time, and without any certainty of
success. Except for Ferane Neheran and Suana Dragand, whowere the heads of the their Ajahs,
Sitters rarely seemed to know what their Ajah’s head was thinking until they were told. “I will tell
you as soon as I learn, Great Mistress.”
But she did file away a tidbit for herself. Trivial matter or not, Mesaana did not know
everything that happened in the White Tower. And Alviarin would keep her eyes open for a sister in
bronze skirts bordered on the hem in black scrollwork. Mesaana was hiding herself in the Tower, and
knowledge was power.

CHAPTER

The Extra Bit

S eaine strode the hallways of the Tower with a growing sense of being confounded at every
turn. The White Tower was quite large, true, but she had been at this for hours. She very much
wanted to be snug in her own rooms. Despite casements in place in every window, drafts drifted
along the broad, tapestry-hung corridors and made the stand-lamps flicker. Cold drafts, and
difficult to ignore when they slipped under her skirts. Her rooms were warm and comfortable,
and safe.
Maids bobbed curtsies and manservants bowed in her wake, half-seen and completely ignored.
Most sisters were in their own Ajahs’ quarters, and those few out and about moved with wary pride,
often in pairs, always of the same Ajah, shawls spread along their arms and displayed like banners.
She smiled and nodded pleasantly to Talene, but the statuesque, golden-haired Sitter returned a hard
stare, beauty carved from ice, then stalked away twitching her green-fringed shawl.
Too late now to approach Talene about being part of the search, even had Pevara been
agreeable. Pevara counseled caution, then more caution, and truth to tell, Seaine was more than
willing to listen under the circumstances. It was just that Talene was a friend. Had been a friend.
Talene was not the worst. Several ordinary sisters sniffed at her openly. At a Sitter! None
White, of course, but that should have made no difference. No matter what was going on in the Tower,
proprieties should be observed. Juilaine Madome, a tall, attractive woman with short-cut black hair
who had held a chair for the Brown less than a year, brushed past her without so much as a murmur of
apology and went off with those mannish strides of hers. Saerin Asnobar, another Brown Sitter, gave
Seaine a fierce scowl and fingered that curved knife she always carried behind her belt before
disappearing down a side corridor. Saerin was Altaran, slight touches of white at her dark temples
emphasizing a thin age-faded white scar across one olive cheek, and only a Warder could match her
for scowling.
Perhaps these things were all to be expected. There had been several unfortunate incidents
recently, and no sister would forget being bundled unceremoniously from the hallways around another
Ajah’s quarters, much less what had sometimes gone with it. Rumor said a Sitter—a Sitter!—had had
more than her dignity ruffled by the Reds, though not who. A great pity the Hall could not obstruct
Elaida’s mad decree, but first one Ajah, then another, had leaped on the new prerogatives, few Sitters

were willing to think of giving them up now that they were in place, and the result was a Tower
divided very nearly into armed camps. Once Seaine had thought the air in the Tower felt like a
quivering hot jelly of suspicion and backbiting; now it was quivering hot jelly with an acid bite.
Clicking her tongue in vexation, she adjusted her own white-fringed shawl as Saerin vanished. It
was illogical to flinch because an Altaran scowled—even Saerin would go no farther; surely not—
and more than illogical to worry over what she could not change when she had a task.
And then, after all of her search that morning, she took a single step and saw her long-sought
quarry walking toward her. Zerah Dacan was a slim, black-haired girl with a prideful air, properly
self-possessed, and by all outward evidence untouched by the heated currents flowing through the
Tower these days. Well, not a girl precisely, but Seaine was sure she had not worn that white-fringed
shawl fifty years yet. She was inexperienced. Relatively inexperienced. That might help.
Zerah made no move to avoid a Sitter of her own Ajah, bowing her head in respect as Seaine
fell in beside her. Quite a lot of intricate golden embroidery climbed the sleeves of her snowy dress
and made a wide band at the bottom of her skirt. It was an unusual degree of show for the White Ajah.
“Sitter,” she murmured. Did her blue eyes hold a touch of worry?
“I need you for something,” Seaine said more calmly than she felt. Very likely she was
transplanting her own feelings into Zerah’s big eyes. “Come with me.” There was nothing to fear, not
in the heart of the White Tower, but keeping her hands folded at her waist, unclenched, required
surprising effort.
As expected—as hoped—Zerah went along with only another murmur, this of acquiescence. She
glided at Seaine’s side quite gracefully as they descended broad marble staircases and wide curving
ramps, and gave only the slightest frown when Seaine opened a door on the ground floor, onto narrow
stairs that spiraled down into darkness.
“After you, sister,” Seaine said, channeling a small ball of light. By protocol, she should have
preceded the other woman, but she could not bring herself to do that.
Zerah did not hesitate in going down. Logically, she had nothing to fear from a Sitter, a White
Sitter. Logically, Seaine would tell her what she wanted when the time was ripe, and it would be
nothing she could not do. Illogically, Seaine’s stomach fluttered like a huge moth. Light, she held
saidar and the other woman did not. Zerah was weaker in any case. There was nothing to fear. Which
did nothing to quiet those fluttering wings in her middle.
Down they climbed and down, past doors letting onto basements and subbasements, until they
reached the very lowest level, below even where the Accepted were tested. The dark hallway was lit
only by Seaine’s small light. They held their skirts high, but their slippers kicked up small clouds of
dust however carefully they stepped. Plain wooden doors lined the smooth stone walls, many with
great lumps of rust for hinges and locks.
“Sitter,” Zerah asked, finally showing doubt, “whatever can we be after down here? I don’t
believe anyone has been this deep for years.”
Seaine was sure her own visit, a few days earlier, had been the first to this level in at least a
century. That was one of the reasons she and Pevara had chosen it. “Just in here,” she said, swinging
open a door that moved with only a little squealing. No amount of oil could loosen all the rust, and
efforts to use the Power had been useless. Her abilities with Earth were better than Pevara’s, but that
was not saying very much.
Zerah stepped in, and blinked in surprise. In an otherwise empty room, Pevara sat behind a
sturdy if rather worn table with three small benches around it. Getting those few pieces down unseen
had been difficult—especially when servants could not be trusted. Clearing out the dust had been

much simpler if no more pleasant, and smoothing the dust in the hall outside, necessary after every
visit, had been simply onerous.
“I was about to give up sitting here in the dark,” Pevara growled. The glow of saidar
surrounded her as she lifted a lantern from beneath the table and channeled it alight, casting as much
illumination as the rough-walled former storeroom deserved. Somewhat plump and normally pretty,
the Red Sitter looked a bear with two sore teeth. “We want to ask you a few questions, Zerah.” And
she shielded the woman as Seaine shut the door.
Zerah’s shadowed face remained utterly calm, but she swallowed audibly. “About what,
Sitters?” There was the faintest tremor in the younger woman’s voice, as well. It could be simply the
mood of the Tower, though.
“The Black Ajah,” Pevara replied curtly. “We want to know whether you’re a Darkfriend.”
Amazement and outrage shattered Zerah’s calm. Most would have taken that for sufficient denial
without her snapped “I don’t have to take that from you! You Reds have been setting up false Dragons
for years! If you ask me, there’s no need to look further than the Red quarters to find Black sisters!”
Pevara’s face darkened with fury. Her loyalty to her Ajah was strong, which went without
saying, but worse, she had lost her entire family to Darkfriends. Seaine decided to step in before
Pevara resorted to brute force. They had no proof. Not yet.
“Sit, Zerah,” she said with as much warmth as she could muster. “Sit down, sister.”
Zerah turned toward the door as though she might disobey an order from a Sitter—and of her
own Ajah!—but at last she settled onto one of the benches, stiffly, sitting right at the edge.
Before Seaine had finished taking a seat that placed Zerah between them, Pevara laid the ivorywhite Oath Rod on the battered tabletop. Seaine sighed. They were Sitters, with a perfect right to use
any ter’angreal they wished, but she had been the one to filch it—she could not help thinking of it as
filching when she had observed none of the proper procedures—and the whole time, in the back of
her head, she had been sure she would turn to find long-dead Sereille Bagand standing here, ready to
haul her off to the Mistress of Novices’ study by her ear. Irrational, but no less real.
“We want to make sure you tell the truth,” Pevara said, still sounding like an angry bear, “so you
will swear an oath on this, and then I’ll ask again.”
“I should not be subjected to this,” Zerah said with an accusing look at Seaine, “but I will reswear all of the Oaths, if that’s what it needs to satisfy you. And I will demand an apology from you
both, afterward.” She hardly sounded like a woman shielded and asked such a question. Almost
contemptuously, she reached for the slim, foot-long rod. It shone in the dim light of the lantern.
“You’ll swear to obey the two of us absolutely,” Pevara told her, and that hand snatched back as
if from a coiled viper. Pevara went right on, even sliding the Rod closer to the woman with two
fingers. “That way, we can tell you to answer truthfully and know you will, and if you give the wrong
answer, we can know you’ll be obedient and helpful in helping us hunt down your Black sisters. The
Rod can be used to free you of the oath, if you give the right answer.”
“To free—?” Zerah exclaimed. “I’ve never heard of anyone being loosed from an oath on the
Oath Rod.”
“That is why we are taking all these precautions,” Seaine told her. “Logically, a Black sister
must be able to lie, which means she must have been freed of at least that Oath and likely all three.
Pevara and I tested, and found the procedure much the same as taking an oath.” She did not mention
how painful it had been, though, leaving the pair of them weeping. She also did not mention that Zerah
would not be freed of her oath whatever her answer, not until the search for the Black Ajah came to a
conclusion. For one thing, she could not be allowed to run off and complain about this questioning,

which she most certainly would, with every right, if she was not of the Black. If.
Light, but Seaine wished they had found a sister from another Ajah who fit the criteria they had
set. A Green or a Yellow would have done quite nicely. That lot were overweening at the best of
times, and of late . . . ! No. She was not going to fall prey to the sickness spreading through the
Tower. Yet she could not help the names that flashed through her head, a dozen Greens, twice as
many Yellows, and every one long past due taking down a few rungs. Sniff at a Sitter?
“You freed yourselves from one of the Oaths?” Zerah sounded startled, disgusted, uneasy, all at
the same time. Perfectly reasonable responses.
“And took it again,” Pevara muttered impatiently. Snatching up the slim rod, she channeled a
little Spirit into one end while maintaining Zerah’s shield. “Under the Light, I vow to speak no word
that is not true. Under the Light, I vow to make no weapon for one man to kill another. Under the
Light, I vow not to use the One Power as a weapon except against Dark-friends or Shadowspawn, or
in the last defense of my life, the life of my Warder, or that of another sister.” She did not grimace
over the part about Warders; new sisters bound for the Red often did. “I am not a Darkfriend. I hope
that satisfies you.” She showed Zerah her teeth, but whether in smile or snarl was hard to say.
Seaine retook the Oaths in turn, each producing a slight momentary pressure everywhere from
her scalp to the soles of her feet. In truth, the pressure was difficult to detect at all, with her skin still
feeling too tight from retaking the Oath against speaking a lie. Claiming that Pevara had a beard or
that the streets of Tar Valon were paved with cheese had been strangely exhilarating for a time—even
Pevara had giggled—but hardly worth the discomfort now. Testing had not really seemed necessary,
to her. Logically, it must be so. Saying that she was not of the Black twisted her tongue—a vile thing
to be forced to deny—but she handed Zerah the Oath Rod with a decisive nod.
Shifting on her bench, the slender woman turned the smooth white rod in her fingers, swallowing
convulsively. The pale lantern light made her appear ill. She looked from one of them to the other,
wide-eyed, then her hands tightened on the Rod, and she nodded.
“Exactly as I said,” Pevara growled, channeling Spirit to the Rod again, “or you’ll be swearing
until you have it right.”
“I vow to obey the two of you absolutely,” Zerah said in a tight voice, then shuddered as the oath
took hold. It was always tighter at the first. “Ask me about the Black Ajah,” she demanded. Her hands
shook holding the Rod. “Ask me about the Black Ajah!” Her intensity told Seaine the answer even
before Pevara released the flow of Spirit and asked the question, commanding utter truth. “No!” Zerah
practically shouted. “No, I am not Black Ajah! Now take this oath from me! Free me!”
Seaine slumped dejectedly, resting her elbows on the table. She certainly had not wanted Zerah
to answer yes, but she had been sure they had found the other woman out in a lie. One lie found, or so
it had seemed, after weeks of searching. How many more weeks of searching lay ahead? And of
looking over her shoulder from waking to sleeping? When she managed to sleep.
Pevara stabbed an accusing finger at the woman. “You told people that you came from the
north.”
Zerah’s eyes went wide again. “I did,” she said slowly. “I rode down the bank of the Erinin to
Jualdhe. Now free me of this oath!” She licked her lips.
Seaine frowned at her. “Goldenthorn seeds and a red cockleburr were found on your
saddlecloth, Zerah. Goldenthorn and red cockleburr can’t be found for a hundred miles south of Tar
Valon.”
Zerah leaped to her feet, and Pevara snapped, “Sit down!”
The woman dropped onto the bench with a loud smack, but she did not even wince. She was

trembling. No, shaking. Her mouth was clamped shut, otherwise Seaine was sure her teeth would
have been chattering. Light, the question of north or south frightened her more than an accusation of
being a Darkfriend.
“From where did you start out,” Seaine asked slowly, “and why—?” She meant to ask why the
woman had gone roundabout—which plainly she had—just to hide which direction she came from,
but answers burst from Zerah’s mouth.
“From Salidar,” she squealed. There was no other word for it. Still clutching the Oath Rod, she
writhed on her bench. Tears spilled from her eyes, eyes as wide as they would go and fixed on
Pevara. Words poured out, though her teeth truly did chatter now. “I c-came to m-make sure all the
sisters here know about the R-Reds and Logain, so they’ll d-depose Elaida and the T-Tower can be
whole again.” With a wail she collapsed into openmouthed bawling as she stared at the Red Sitter.
“Well,” Pevara said. Then again, more grimly, “Well!” Her face was all composure, but the
glitter in her dark eyes was far from the mischief Seaine remembered as novice and Accepted. “So
you are the source of that . . . rumor. You are going to stand before the Hall and reveal it for the lie it
is! Admit the lie, girl!”
If Zerah’s eyes had been wide before, they bulged now. The Rod dropped from her hands to roll
across the tabletop, and she clutched her throat. A choking sound came from her suddenly gaping
mouth. Pevara stared at her in shock, but suddenly Seaine understood.
“Light’s mercy,” she breathed. “You do not have to lie, Zerah.” Zerah’s legs thrashed beneath
the table as if she were trying to rise and could not get her feet under her. “Tell her, Pevara. She
believes it’s true! You’ve commanded her to speak the truth and to lie. Don’t look at me that way!
She believes!” A bluish tinge appeared on Zerah’s lips. Her eyelids fluttered. Seaine gathered calm
with both hands. “Pevara, you gave the order so apparently you must release her, or she will suffocate
right in front of us.”
“She’s a rebel.” Pevara’s mutter invested that word with all the scorn it could hold. But then she
sighed. “She hasn’t been tried, yet. You don’t have to . . . lie . . . girl.” Zerah toppled forward and lay
with her cheek pressed against the tabletop, gulping air between whimpers.
Seaine shook her head in wonder. They had not considered the possibility of conflicting oaths.
What if the Black Ajah did not merely remove the Oath against lying, but replaced it with one of their
own? What if they replaced all Three with their own oaths? She and Pevara would need to go very
carefully if they did find a Black sister, or they might have her fall dead before they knew what the
conflict was. Perhaps first a renunciation of all oaths—no way to go about it more carefully without
knowing what Black sisters swore—followed by retaking the Three? Light, the pain of being loosed
from everything at once would be little short of being put to the question. Maybe not short of it at all.
But certainly a Darkfriend deserved that and more. If they ever found one.
Pevara glared down at the gasping woman without the slightest touch of pity on her face. “When
she stands trial for rebellion, I intend to sit on her court.”
“When she is tried, Pevara,” Seaine said thoughtfully. “A pity to lose the assistance of one we
know isn’t a Darkfriend. And since she is a rebel, we need not be overly concerned about using her.”
There had been a number of discussions, none to a conclusion, about the second reason for leaving the
new oath in place. A sister sworn to obey could be compelled—Seaine shifted uneasily; that sounded
entirely too close to the forbidden vileness of Compulsion—she could be induced to help in the hunt,
so long as you did not mind forcing her to accept the danger, whether she wished to or not. “I cannot
think they would send only one,” she went on. “Zerah, how many of you came to spread this tale?”
“Ten,” the woman mumbled against the tabletop, then jerked erect, glaring in defiance. “I will

not betray my sisters! I won’t—!” Abruptly she cut off, lips twisting bitterly as she realized she had
done just that.
“Names!” Pevara barked. “Give me their names, or I will have your hide here and now!”
Names spilled from Zerah’s unwilling lips. At the command, certainly, more than the threat.
Looking at Pevara’s grim face, though, Seaine was sure she needed little provocation to stripe Zerah
like a novice caught stealing. Strangely, she herself did not feel the same animosity. Revulsion, yes,
but clearly not as strong. The woman was a rebel who had helped break the White Tower when a
sister must accept anything to keep the Tower whole, and yet. . . . Very strange.
“You agree, Pevara?” she said when the list concluded. The stubborn woman gave her only a
fierce nod for agreement. “Very well. Zerah, you will bring Bernaile to my rooms this afternoon.”
There were two from each Ajah excepting the Blue and the Red, it seemed, but best to begin with the
other White. “You will say only that I wish to speak to her on a private matter. You will give her no
warning by word, deed, or omission. Then you will stand quietly and let Pevara and me do what is
necessary. You are being recruited into a worthier cause than your misguided rebellion, Zerah.” Of
course it was misguided. No matter how mad with power Elaida had become. “You are going to help
us hunt down the Black Ajah.”
Zerah’s head jerked unwilling nods at each injunction, her face pained, but at mention of a hunt
for the Black Ajah, she gasped. Light, her wits must have been totally unhinged by her experiences not
to see that!
“And you will stop spreading these . . . stories,” Pevara put in sternly. “From this moment,
you’ll not mention the Red Ajah and false Dragons together. Am I understood?”
Zerah’s face donned a mask of sullen stubbornness. Zerah’s mouth said, “I understand, Sitter.”
She looked ready to begin weeping again from sheer frustration.
“Then get out of my sight,” Pevara told her, releasing the shield and saidar together. “And
compose yourself! Wash your face and straighten your hair!” That last was directed at the back of the
woman already darting from the table. Zerah had to pull her hands away from her hair to open the
door. As the door squeaked shut behind her, Pevara snorted. “I wouldn’t put it past her to have gone
to this Bernaile like a sloven, hoping to warn her that way.”
“A valid point,” Seaine admitted. “But who will we warn if we scowl right and left at these
women? At the very least, we will attract notice.”
“The way matters are, Seaine, we wouldn’t attract notice kicking them across the Tower
grounds.” Pevara sounded as if that were an attractive notion. “They are rebels, and I intend to hold
them so hard they squeak if one of them so much as has a wrong thought!”
They went round and round about that. Seaine insisted that care in the orders they gave, leaving
no loopholes, would be sufficient. Pevara pointed out that they were letting ten rebels—ten!—walk
the Tower’s halls unpunished. Seaine said they would face punishment eventually, and Pevara
growled that eventually was not soon enough. Seaine had always admired the other woman’s strength
of will, but really, sometimes it was pure stubbornness.
A faint creak from a hinge was all the warning Seaine had to snatch the Oath Rod into her lap,
hiding it in folds of her skirt as the door opened wide. She and Pevara embraced the Source almost as
one.
Saerin walked into the room calmly, holding a lantern, and stood aside for Talene, who was
followed by tiny Yukiri, with a second light, and boyishly slim Doesine, tall for a Cairhienin, who
closed the door quite firmly and settled her back against it as if to keep anyone from leaving. Four
Sitters, representing all the remaining Ajahs in the Tower. They seemed to ignore the fact that Seaine

and Pevara held saidar. Suddenly, to Seaine, the room felt rather crowded. Imagination, and
irrational, but . . .
“Strange to see the pair of you together,” Saerin said. Her face might be serene, but she slid
fingers along the hilt of that curved knife behind her belt. She had held her chair forty years, longer
than anyone else in the Hall, and everyone had learned to be careful of her temper.
“We might say the same of you,” Pevara replied dryly. Saerin’s temper never upset her. “Or did
you come down here to help Doesine try to get some of her own back?” A sudden flush made the
Yellow’s face look even more that of a pretty boy despite her elegant bearing, and told Seaine which
Sitter had strayed too near the Red quarters with unfortunate results. “I wouldn’t have thought that
would bring you together, though. Greens at Yellows’ throats, Browns at Grays’. Or did you just
bring them down for a quiet duel, Saerin?”
Frantically, Seaine cast around for what reason would have these four this deep into the bedrock
of Tar Valon. What could tie them together? Their Ajahs—all of the Ajahs—truly were at one
another’s throats. All four had been handed penances by Elaida. No Sitter could enjoy Labor,
especially when everyone knew exactly why she was scrubbing floors or pots, yet that was hardly a
bond. What else? None were nobly born. Saerin and Yukiri were the daughters of innkeepers, Talene
of farmers, while Doesine’s father had been a cutler. Saerin had been trained first by the Daughters of
Silence, the only one of that lot to reach the shawl. Absolutely useless drivel. Suddenly, something
did strike her, and dried her throat. Saerin with her temper often barely in rein. Doesine, who had
actually run away three times as a novice, though she had only once made it as far as the bridges.
Talene, who might have earned more punishments than any other novice in the history of the Tower.
Yukiri, always the last Gray to join her sisters’ consensus when she wanted to go another way, the
last to join the Hall’s, for that matter. All four were considered rebels, in a way, and Elaida had
humiliated every one. Could they be thinking they had made a mistake, standing to depose Siuan and
raise Elaida? Could they have found out about Zerah and the others? And if so, what did they intend
to do?
Mentally, Seaine prepared herself to weave saidar, though without much hope that she could
escape. Pevara matched Saerin and Yukiri in strength, but she herself was weaker than any here save
Doesine. She prepared herself, and Talene stepped forward and burst all of her logical deductions to
flinders.
“Yukiri noticed you two sneaking about together, and we want to know why.” Her surprisingly
deep voice held heat despite the ice that seemed to coat her face. “Did the heads of your Ajahs set
you a secret task? In public, the Ajahs’ heads snarl at one another worse than anyone else, but they’ve
been sneaking off into corners to talk, it seems. Whatever they’re scheming, the Hall has a right to
know.”
“Oh, do give over, Talene.” Yukiri’s voice was always an even bigger surprise than Talene’s.
The woman looked a miniature queen, in dark silver silk with ivory lace, but she sounded a
comfortable country woman. She claimed the contrast helped in negotiations. She smiled at Seaine
and Pevara, a monarch perhaps unsure how gracious she should be. “I saw the pair of you sniffing
about like ferrets at the hencoop,” she said, “but I held my tongue—you might be pillow friends, for
all I know, and whose business is that but yours?—I held my tongue till Talene here started yelping
about who’s been huddling in corners. I’ve seen a bit of huddling in corners myself, and I suspect
some of those women might head their Ajahs as well, so. . . . Sometimes six and six make a dozen,
and sometimes they make a mess. Tell us if you can, now. The Hall does have a right.”
“We are not leaving until you do tell,” Talene put in even more heatedly than before.

Pevara snorted and folded her arms. “If the head of my Ajah spoke two words to me, I’d see no
reason to tell you what they were. As it happens, what Seaine and I were discussing has nothing to do
with the Red or the White. Snoop elsewhere.” But she did not release saidar. Neither did Seaine.
“Bloody useless and I bloody knew it,” Doesine muttered from her place by the door. “Why I
ever flaming let you talk me into this. . . . Just as bloody well nobody else knows, or we’d have
sheepswallop all over faces for the whole bloody Tower to see.” At times she had a tongue like a
boy, too, a boy who needed his mouth washed out.
Seaine would have stood to leave if she had not feared her knees would betray her. Pevara did
stand, and raised an impatient eyebrow at the women between her and the door.
Saerin fingered her knife hilt and eyed them quizzically, not shifting a step. “A puzzle,” she
murmured. Suddenly she glided forward, her free hand dipping into Seaine’s lap so quickly that
Seaine gasped. She tried to keep the Oath Rod hidden, but the only result was that she ended with
Saerin holding the Rod waist high with one hand while she held the other end and a fistful of her
skirts. “I enjoy puzzles,” Saerin said.
Seaine let go and adjusted her dress; there seemed nothing else to do.
The appearance of the Rod produced a momentary babble as nearly everyone spoke at once.
“Blood and fire,” Doesine growled. “Are you down here raising new bloody sisters?”
“Oh, leave it with them, Saerin,” Yukiri laughed right on top of her. “Whatever they’re up to, it’s
their own business.”
Atop both, Talene barked, “Why else are they sneaking about—together!—if it isn’t to do with
the Ajah heads?”
Saerin waved a hand, and after a moment gained quiet. All present were Sitters, but she had the
right to speak first in the Hall, and her forty years counted for something, too. “This is the key to the
puzzle, I think,” she said, stroking the Rod with her thumb. “Why this, after all?” Abruptly the glow of
saidar surrounded her, too, and she channeled Spirit to the Rod. “Under the Light, I will speak no
word that is not true. I am not a Dark-friend.”
In the silence that followed, a mouse sneezing would have sounded loud.
“Am I right?” Saerin said, releasing the Power. She held the Rod out toward Seaine.
For the third time, Seaine retook the Oath against lying, and for the second time repeated that she
was not of the Black. Pevara did the same with frozen dignity. And eyes sharp as an eagle’s.
“This is ridiculous,” Talene said. “There is no Black Ajah.”
Yukiri took the Rod from Pevara and channeled. “Under the Light, I will speak no word that is
not true. I am not Black Ajah.” The light of saidar around her winked out, and she handed the Rod to
Doesine.
Talene frowned in disgust. “Stand aside, Doesine. I for one will not put up with this filthy
suggestion.”
“Under the Light, I will speak no word that is not true,” Doesine said almost reverently, the glow
around her like a halo. “I am not of the Black Ajah.” When matters were serious, her tongue was as
clean as any Mistress of Novices could have wished. She extended the Rod to Talene.
The golden-haired woman started back as from a poisonous snake. “Even to ask this is a slander.
Worse than slander!” Something feral moved in her eyes. An irrational thought, perhaps, but that was
what Seaine saw. “Now move out of my way,” Talene demanded with all the authority of a Sitter in
her voice. “I am leaving!”
“I think not,” Pevara said quietly, and Yukiri nodded slowly in agreement. Saerin did not stroke
her knife hilt; she gripped it till her knuckles went white.

Riding through the deep snows of Andor, floundering through them, Toveine Gazal cursed the
day she was born. Short and slightly plump, with smooth copper skin and long glossy dark hair, she
had seemed pretty to many over the years, but none had ever called her beautiful. Certainly none
would now. The dark eyes that had once been direct now bored into whatever she looked at. That
was when she was not angry. She was angry today. When Toveine was angry, serpents fled.
Four other Reds rode—floundered—at her back, and behind them twenty of the Tower Guard in
dark coats and cloaks. None of the men liked it that their armor was stowed away on the packhorses,
and they watched the forest lining both sides of the road as though expecting attack any moment. How
they thought to cross three hundred miles of Andor unnoticed, wearing coats and cloaks with the
Flame of Tar Valon shining bright on them, Toveine could not imagine. The journey was almost done,
though. In another day, perhaps two with roads knee-deep in snow on the horses, she would join with
nine other parties exactly like hers. Not all of the sisters in them were Red, unfortunately, but that did
not trouble her overmuch. Toveine Gazal, once a Sitter for the Red, would go into the histories as the
woman who destroyed this Black Tower.
She was sure Elaida thought her grateful for the chance, called back from exile and disgrace,
given the opportunity for redemption. She sneered, and if a wolf had been looking into the deep hood
of her cloak, it might have quailed. What had been done twenty years ago was necessary, and the
Light burn all those who muttered that the Black Ajah must have been involved. It had been necessary
and right, but Toveine Gazal had been driven from her chair in the Hall, and forced to howl for mercy
under the birch, with the assembled sisters watching, and even novices and Accepted witnessing that
Sitters, too, lay beneath the law, though they were not told what law. And then she had been sent to
work these last twenty years on the isolated Black Hills farm of Mistress Jara Doweel, a woman who
considered an Aes Sedai serving penance in exile no different from any other hand laboring in sun
and snow. Toveine’s hands shifted on her reins; she could feel the calluses. Mistress Doweel—even
now, she could not think of the woman without the honorific she had demanded—Mistress Doweel
believed in hard work. And discipline as tight as any novice faced! She had no mercy on anyone who
tried to shirk the backbreaking labor that she herself shared, and less than none for a woman who
sneaked away to comfort herself with a pretty boy. That had been Toveine’s life for fifteen years. And
Elaida had slipped through the cracks uncaught, danced her way to the Amyrlin Seat that Toveine had
once dreamed of for herself. No, she was not grateful. But she had learned to wait her chance.
Abruptly, a tall man in a black coat, dark hair falling to his shoulders, spurred his horse out of
the forest into the road ahead of her, spraying snow. “There’s no point struggling,” he announced
firmly, raising a gloved hand. “Surrender peacefully, and no one will be hurt.”
It was neither his appearance nor his words that made Toveine rein up short, letting the other
sisters gather beside her. “Take him,” she said calmly. “You had better link. He has me shielded.” It
seemed one of these Asha’man had come to her. How convenient of him.
Abruptly she realized that nothing was happening and took her eyes from the fellow to frown at
Jenare. The woman’s pale, square face seemed absolutely bloodless. “Toveine,” she said unsteadily,
“I also am shielded.”
“I am shielded, too,” Lemai breathed in disbelief, and the others chimed in, increasingly frantic.
All shielded.
More men in black coats appeared from among the trees, their horses stepping slowly, all
around. Toveine stopped counting at fifteen. The Guards muttered angrily, waiting on a sister’s
command. They knew nothing yet except that a band of rogues had waylaid them. Toveine clicked her
tongue in irritation. These men could not all channel, of course, but apparently every Asha’man who

could do so had come against her. She did not panic. Unlike some of the sisters with her, these were
not the first men who channeled that she had confronted. The tall man began riding toward her,
smiling, apparently thinking they had obeyed his ridiculous order.
“At my command,” she said quietly, “we will break in every direction. As soon as you are far
enough away that the man loses the shield,” men always thought they had to be able to see to hold
their weaves, which meant that they did have to, “turn back and help the Guards. Ready yourselves.”
She raised her voice to a shout. “Guardsmen, fight them!”
Roaring, the Guardsmen surged forward, waving their swords and no doubt thinking to surround
and protect the sisters. Pulling her mare around to the right, Toveine dug in her heels and crouched
low over Sparrow’s neck, dodging between startled Guardsmen, then between two very young men in
black coats who gaped at her in astonishment. Then she was into the trees, urging more speed, snow
spraying wildly, careless of whether the mare broke a leg. She liked the animal, but more than a horse
would die today. Behind her, shouts. And one voice, roaring through all the cacophony. The tall
man’s voice.
“Take them alive, by order of the Dragon Reborn! Harm an Aes Sedai, and you’ll answer to
me!”
By order of the Dragon Reborn. For the first time, Toveine felt fear, an icicle worming into her
middle. The Dragon Reborn. She thrashed Sparrow’s neck with the reins. The shield was still on her!
Surely there were enough trees between them already to block the cursed men’s sight of her! Oh,
Light, the Dragon Reborn!
She grunted as something struck her across the middle, a branch where there was no branch,
snatching her out of the saddle. She hung there watching Sparrow plow off at as much of a gallop as
the snow allowed. She hung there. In the middle of the air, arms trapped at her sides, feet dangling a
pace or more above the ground. She swallowed. Hard. It had to be the male part of the Power holding
her up. She had never been touched by saidin before. She could feel the thick band of nothing snug
around her middle. She thought she could feel the Dark One’s taint. She quivered, fighting down
screams.
The tall man reined his horse to a halt in front of her, and she floated down to sit sideways in
front of his saddle. He did not seem particularly interested in the Aes Sedai he had captured, though.
“Hardlin!” he shouted. “Norley! Kajima! One of you bloody young louts come here now!”
He was very tall, with shoulders an axe-handle wide. That was how Mistress Doweel would
have put it. Just short of his middle years, handsome in a brooding, rugged fashion. Not at all like the
pretty boys Toveine liked, eager and grateful and so easily controlled. A silver sword decorated the
tall collar of his black wool coat on one side, with a peculiar creature in gold and red enamel on the
other. He was a man who could channel. And he had her shielded and a prisoner.
The shriek that burst from her throat startled even her. She would have held it back if she could,
but another leaped out behind it, higher still, and another even higher, another and another. Kicking
wildly, she flung herself from side to side. Useless against the Power. She knew that, but only in a
tiny corner of her mind. The rest of her howled at the top of her lungs, howled wordless pleas for
rescue from the Shadow. Screaming, she struggled like a mad beast.
Dimly she was aware of his horse plunging and dancing as her heels drummed its shoulder.
Dimly she heard the man talking. “Easy, you lump-eared sack of coal! Calm down, sister. I’m not
going to—Easy, you spavined mule! Light! My apologies, sister, but this is how we learn to do it.”
And then he kissed her.
She had only a heartbeat to realize his lips were touching hers, then sight vanished, and warmth

flooded through her. More than warmth. She was melted honey inside, bubbling honey, rushing
toward the boil. She was a harpstring, vibrating faster and faster, vibrating to invisibility and faster
still. She was a thin crystal vase, quivering on the brink of shattering. The harpstring broke; the vase
shattered.
“Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!”
At first, she did not realize that sound had come from her gaping mouth. For a moment, she could
not think coherently. Panting, she stared up at the male face above her, wondering who it belonged to.
Yes. The tall man. The man who could—
“I could have done without the extra bit,” he sighed, patting the horse’s neck; the animal snorted,
but it no longer leaped about, “yet I suppose it is necessary. You’re hardly a wife. Be calm. Don’t try
to escape, don’t attack anyone in a black coat, and don’t touch the Source unless I give you
permission. Now, what’s your name?”
Unless he gave permission? The effrontery of the man!
“Toveine Gazal,” she said, and blinked. Now, why had she answered him?
“There you are,” another black-coated man said, splashing his horse through the snow to them.
This one would be much more to her liking—if he could not actually channel, at least. She doubted
this pink-cheeked lad shaved more than twice in the week. “Light, Logain!” the pretty boy exclaimed.
“Did you take a second one? The M’Hael won’t like that! I don’t think he likes us taking any! Maybe
it won’t matter, though, you two being so close and all.”
“Close, Vinchova?” Logain said wryly. “If the M’Hael had his way, I’d be hoeing turnips with
the new boys. Or buried under the field,” he added in a mutter she did not think he meant to be heard.
However much he heard, the pretty boy laughed with incredulous disbelief. Toveine barely
heard him. She was gazing up at the man looming over her. Logain. The false Dragon. But he was
dead! Stilled and dead! And holding her before his saddle with a casual hand. Why was she not
screaming, or striking at him? Even her belt knife would do, this near. Yet she had no desire at all to
reach for the ivory haft. She could, she realized. That band around her middle was gone. She could at
least slip down off the horse and try to—She had no desire to do that, either.
“What did you do to me?” she demanded. Calmly. At least she had managed to hold on to that!
Turning his horse to ride back to the road, Logain told her what he had done, and she put her
head against that wide chest, not caring at all how big he was, and wept. She was going to make
Elaida pay for this, she vowed. If Logain ever let her, she would. That last was an especially bitter
thought.

CHAPTER

The Bargain

S eated cross-legged in a heavily gilded, high-backed chair, Min tried to lose herself in the
leather-bound copy of Herid Fel’s Reason and Unreason lying open on her knees. It was not
easy. Oh, the book itself was mesmerizing; Master Fel’s writings always swept her into worlds
of thought she had not dreamed of while working in stables. She very much regretted the sweet
old man’s death. She hoped to find a clue in his books to why he had been killed. Her dark
ringlets swung as she shook her head and tried to apply herself.
The book was fascinating, but the room was oppressive. Rand’s small throne room in the Sun
Palace was thick with gilt from the wide cornices to the tall mirrors on the walls replacing those
Rand had smashed, from the two rows of chairs like the one she sat in to the dais at the head of the
rows and the Dragon Throne atop the dais. That was a monstrosity, in the style of Tear as imagined by
Cairhienin craftsmen, resting on the backs of a pair of Dragons with two more Dragons for the arms
and others climbing the back, all with large sunstones for eyes, the whole glittering with gilt and red
enamel. A huge golden, wavy-rayed Rising Sun set in the polished stone floor only added to the sense
of heaviness. At least the fires blazing in two great fireplaces, tall enough for her to walk into, gave a
pleasing warmth, especially with snow spilling down outside. And these were Rand’s rooms; the
comfort of that alone outweighed any amount of oppression. An irritating thought. This was Rand’s
room if he ever deigned to return. A very irritating thought. Being in love with a man seemed to
consist largely of a great many irritating admissions to yourself!
Shifting in a vain attempt to make the hard chair comfortable, she tried to read, but her eyes kept
swinging to the tall doors, each climbed by its own line of gilded Rising Suns. She hoped to see Rand
walk in; she feared to see Sorilea, or Cadsuane. Unconsciously, she adjusted her pale blue coat,
fingering the tiny snowflowers embroidered on the lapels. More twined around the sleeves, and the
legs of breeches made as snug as she could manage to wriggle herself into. Not that great a change
from what she had always worn. Not really. So far, she had avoided dresses, however much
embroidery she wore, but she very much feared that Sorilea meant to stuff her into a dress if the Wise
One had to peel her out of what she was wearing with her own hands.
The woman knew all about her and Rand. All about. She felt her cheeks heating. Sorilea seemed
to be trying to decide whether Min Farshaw was a suitable . . . lover . . . for Rand al’Thor. That word

made her feel foolishly giddy; she was not a fluff-brained girl! That word made her want to look over
her shoulder guiltily for the aunts who had raised her. No, she thought wryly, you’re not fluffbrained. Fluff has its wits about it compared to you!
Or maybe Sorilea wanted to know whether Rand was suitable for Min; it seemed that way, at
times. The Wise Ones accepted Min as one of them, or very nearly, but these past weeks, Sorilea had
wrung her out like a laundress’s mangle. The leather-faced, white-haired Wise One wanted to know
every scrap about Min, and every shred about Rand. She wanted the dust from the bottoms of his
pockets! Twice Min had tried balking at the incessant interrogation, and twice Sorilea had produced a
switch! That terrible old woman simply bundled her over the side of the nearest table, and afterward
told her that maybe that would loosen another scrap in her head. None of the other Wise Ones gave
the slightest commiseration, either! Light, the things you had to put up with for a man! And she could
not have him for herself alone, at that!
Cadsuane was a different proposition altogether. The immensely dignified Aes Sedai, as grayhaired as Sorilea was white, did not seem to care two figs for Min or Rand either one, but she spent a
great deal of time in the Sun Palace. Avoiding her entirely was impossible; she seemed to wander
wherever she wanted. And when Cadsuane looked at Min, however briefly, Min could not help
seeing a woman who could teach bulls to dance and bears to sing. She kept expecting the woman to
point at her and announce that it was time Min Farshaw learned to balance a ball on her nose. Sooner
or later, Rand had to face Cadsuane again, and the thought tied Min’s stomach in knots.
She made herself bend back over her book. One of the doors swung open, and Rand strolled in
with the Dragon Scepter nestled in the crook of his arm. He wore a golden crown, a broad circlet of
laurel leaves—that must be this Crown of Swords everyone was talking about—snug breeches that
showed his legs to advantage, and a gold-worked green silk coat that fit him beautifully. He was
beautiful.
Marking her place with the note Master Fel had written saying she was “too pretty,” she
carefully closed the book and carefully set it on the floor beside her chair. Then she folded her arms
and waited. Had she been standing, she would have tapped her foot, but she would not have the man
thinking she was springing up just because he finally appeared.
For a moment he stood smiling at her, and tugging his earlobe for some reason—he seemed to be
humming!—then abruptly he swung round to frown at the doors. “The Maidens out there didn’t tell me
you were in here. They hardly said a word at all. Light, they looked ready to veil at the sight of me.”
“Maybe they are upset,” she said calmly. “Maybe they wondered where you were. The way I
did. Maybe they wondered whether you were hurt, or sick, or cold.” The way I did, she thought
bitterly. The man looked confused!
“I wrote to you,” he said slowly, and she sniffed.
“Twice! With Asha’man to deliver your letters, you wrote twice, Rand al’Thor. If you call it
writing!”
He staggered as if she had slapped him—no; as if she had kicked him in the belly!—and blinked.
She took a firm hold on herself and settled against the chairback. Give a man sympathy at the wrong
moment, and you never regained the ground lost. A part of her wanted to throw her arms around him,
comfort him, draw out all his pains, soothe all his hurts. He had so many, and refused to admit a one.
She was not going to spring up and rush to him, gushing to know what was wrong or . . . Light, he had
to be all right.
Something took her gently beneath the elbows and lifted her out of the chair. Blue boots
dangling, she floated toward him through the air. The Dragon Scepter floated away from him. So, he

thought he could smile, did he? He thought a pretty smile could turn her around? She opened her
mouth to give him a piece of her mind. A very sharp piece! Folding his arms around her, he kissed
her.
When she could breathe again, she peered up at him through her lashes. “The first time . . .” She
swallowed to clear her voice. “First, Jahar Narishma stalked in trying to stare inside everybody’s
skull the way he does, and vanished after handing me a scrap of parchment. Let me see. It said, ‘I
have claimed the crown of Illian. Trust no one until I return. Rand.’ A little short of a proper love
letter, I’d say.”
He kissed her again.
This time, getting her breath back took longer. This was not going as she had expected at all. On
the other hand, it was not going very badly. “The second time, Jonan Adley delivered a bit of paper
that said, ‘I will return when I finish here. Trust no one. Rand.’ Adley walked in on me in my bath,”
she added, “and he wasn’t shy about getting an eyeful.” Rand always tried to pretend he was not
jealous—as if there were a man in the world who was not—but she had noticed his scowls at men
who looked at her. And his very considerable ardor was more heated afterward, too. She wondered
what this kiss would be like. Maybe she should suggest retiring to the bedchamber? No, she would
not be that forward no matter—
Rand set her down, his face suddenly bleak. “Adley’s dead,” he said. Suddenly the crown flew
from his head, spinning the length of the room as though hurled. Just when she thought it would crash
into the back of the Dragon Throne, perhaps smash through it, the wide ring of gold stopped short and
settled slowly onto the throne’s seat.
Min’s breath caught as she looked up at him. Blood glistened in the dark red curls above his left
ear. Pulling a lace-edged handkerchief from her sleeve, she reached for his temple, but he caught her
wrist.
“I killed him,” he said quietly.
She shivered at the sound of his voice. Quiet, the way the grave was quiet. Perhaps the
bedchamber was a very good idea. No matter how forward it was. Making herself smile—and
blushing when she realized how easy it was to smile, thinking of that huge bed—she gripped the front
of his shirt, preparing to rip shirt and coat from his back right then and there.
Someone knocked at the doors.
Min’s hands sprang away from Rand’s shirt. She sprang away, too. Who could it be, she
wondered irritably. The Maidens either announced visitors when Rand was there, or simply sent them
in.
“Come,” he said loudly, giving her a rueful smile. And she blushed again at that.
Dobraine put his head in at the door, then entered and shut the door behind him when he saw
them standing together. The Cairhienin lord was a small man, little taller than she, with the front of his
head shaved and the rest of his mostly gray hair falling to his shoulders. Stripes of blue and white
decorated the front of his nearly black coat to below his waist. Even before gaining Rand’s favor he
had been a power in the land. Now, he ruled here, at least until Elayne could claim the Sun Throne.
“My Lord Dragon,” he murmured, bowing. “My Lady Ta’veren.”
“A joke,” Min muttered, when Rand quirked an eyebrow at her.
“Perhaps,” Dobraine said, shrugging slightly, “yet half the noblewomen in the city now wear
bright colors in imitation of the Lady Min. Breeches that display their legs, and many in coats that do
not even cover their . . .” He coughed discreetly, realizing that Min’s coat did not cover her hips
completely.

She thought about telling him he had very pretty legs, even if they were decidedly knobby, then
quickly thought better. Rand’s jealousy might be a wonderful flame if they were alone, but she did not
want him striking out at Dobraine. He was capable of that, she feared. Besides, she thought it really
was a slip; Lord Dobraine Taborwin was not the sort to make even slightly rough jokes.
“So you’re changing the world, too, Min.” Grinning, Rand tapped the tip of her nose with a
finger. He tapped her nose! Like a child he was amused with! Worse, she felt herself grinning back at
him like a fool. “In better ways than I am, it appears,” he went on, and that momentary boyish grin
faded like mist.
“Is all well in Tear and Illian, my Lord Dragon?” Dobraine enquired.
“In Tear and Illian, all is well,” Rand replied grimly. “What do you have for me, Dobraine? Sit,
man. Sit.” He motioned toward the rows of chairs, and took one for himself.
“I have acted on all of your letters,” Dobraine said, seating himself across from Rand, “but there
is little good to report, I fear.”
“I’ll get us something to drink,” Min said in a tight voice. Letters? It was not easy to stalk in
heeled boots—she had grown accustomed to them, but the things made you sway whatever you did—
not easy, yet enough anger made anything possible. She stalked to the small gilded table beneath one
of the huge mirrors where a silver pitcher and goblets sat. She busied herself with pouring spiced
wine, splashing it out furiously. The servants always brought extra goblets, in case she had visitors,
though she seldom did except for Sorilea or a fool lot of noblewomen. The wine was barely warm,
but it was more than hot enough for the likes of that pair. She had received two letters, but she would
bet Dobraine had had ten! Twenty! Banging pitcher and goblets about, she listened carefully. What
had they been up to behind her back with their dozens of letters?
“Toram Riatin appears to have vanished,” Dobraine said, “though rumor, at least, says he still
lives, worse luck. Rumors also say that Daved Hanlon and Jeraal Mordeth—Padan Fain, as you call
the man—have deserted him. By the way, I have settled Toram’s sister, the Lady Ailil, in generous
apartments, with servants who are . . . trustworthy.” By his tone, he clearly meant trustworthy toward
himself. The woman would not be able to change her dress without him knowing. “I can understand
bringing her here, and Lord Bertome and the others, but why High Lord Weiramon, or High Lady
Anaiyella? It goes without saying, of course, that their servants also are trustworthy.”
“How do you know when a woman wants to kill you?” Rand mused.
“When she knows your name?” Dobraine did not sound as if he were joking. Rand tilted his head
thoughtfully, then nodded. Nodded! She hoped he was not still hearing voices.
Rand gestured as if brushing away the women who wanted to kill him. A dangerous thing, with
her about. She did not want to kill him, certainly, but she would not mind seeing Sorilea go at him
with that switch! Breeches did not give much protection.
“Weiramon is a fool who makes too many mistakes,” Rand told Dobraine, who nodded sober
agreement. “My mistake for thinking I could use him. He seems happy enough to stay near the Dragon
Reborn in any case. What else?” Min handed him a goblet, and he smiled at her despite the wine that
slopped over his wrist. Maybe he thought it was an accident.
“Little else and too much,” Dobraine began, then jerked back in his chair to avoid spilling wine
as Min shoved the second silver goblet at him. She had not liked her brief stint as a tavernmaid. “My
thanks, my Lady Min,” he murmured graciously, but he eyed her askance as he took the goblet. She
walked calmly back to fetch her own wine. Calmly.
“I fear that Lady Caraline and the High Lord Darlin are in Lady Arilyn’s palace here in the
City,” the Cairhienin lord went on, “under the protection of Cadsuane Sedai. Perhaps protection is not

the correct word. I have been refused entry to see them, but I hear that they have attempted to leave
the City and been brought back like sacks. In a sack, one story claims. Having met Cadsuane, I can
almost believe it.”
“Cadsuane,” Rand murmured, and Min felt a chill. He did not sound afraid, precisely, yet he did
sound more than uneasy. “What do you think I should do about Caraline and Darlin, Min?”
Settling into a chair two away from him, Min jerked at suddenly being included. Ruefully, she
stared down at the wine soaking through her best cream silk blouse, and her breeches, too. “Caraline
will support Elayne for the Sun Throne,” she said glumly. For warm wine, it seemed very cold, and
she doubted the stain would ever come out of the blouse. “Not a viewing, but I believe her.” She did
not glance toward Dobraine, though he nodded sagely. Everyone knew about her viewings, now. The
only result had been a stream of noblewomen who wanted to know their futures, and right sulky, too,
when she said she could not tell them. Most would not have been pleased with the little she had seen;
nothing dire, but not at all the bright wonders that fortune-tellers at the fair forecast. “As for Darlin,
aside from the fact that he’ll marry Caraline, after she’s wrung him out and hung him up to dry, all I
can say is that one day he’ll be a king. I saw the crown on his head, a thing with a sword on the front
of it, but I don’t know what country it belongs to. And, oh, yes. He’ll die in bed, and she will survive
him.”
Dobraine choked on his wine, spluttering and dabbing at his lips with a plain linen handkerchief.
Most of those who knew did not believe. Quite satisfied with herself, Min drank the little that
remained in her goblet. And then she was choking and gasping, jerking her handkerchief from her
sleeve to wipe at her mouth. Light, she would have to give herself the dregs!
Rand simply nodded, peering into his goblet. “So they will live to trouble me,” he murmured. A
very soft sound, for words like stone. He was hard as a blade, her sheepherder. “And what do I do
about—”
Abruptly he twisted in his chair, toward the doors. One was opening. He had very sharp ears.
Min had heard nothing.
Neither of the two Aes Sedai who entered was Cadsuane, and Min felt her shoulders loosen as
she tucked her handkerchief away. While Rafela shut the door, Merana curtsied deeply to Rand,
though the Gray sister’s hazel eyes took in Min and Dobraine and filed them away, and then the
round-faced Rafela was spreading her deep blue skirts wide, too. Neither rose until Rand gestured.
They glided to him wearing cool serenity as they did their dresses. Except that the plump Blue sister
fingered her shawl briefly as though to remind herself it was there. Min had seen that gesture before,
from other sisters who had sworn fealty to Rand. It could not be easy for them. Only the White Tower
commanded Aes Sedai, but Rand crooked a finger and they came, pointed and they went. Aes Sedai
spoke with kings and queens as equals, perhaps slightly as their betters, yet the Wise Ones called
them apprentices and expected them to obey twice as fast as Rand did.
None of that showed on Merana’s smooth face. “My Lord Dragon,” she said respectfully. “We
only just learned that you had returned, and we thought you might be eager to learn how matters went
with the Atha’an Miere.” She merely glanced at Dobraine, but he rose immediately. Cairhienin were
used to people wanting to speak in private.
“Dobraine can stay,” Rand said curtly. Had he hesitated? He did not stand. His eyes like blue
ice, he was being the Dragon Reborn for all he was worth. Min had told him these women were his in
truth, that all five who had accompanied him to the Sea Folk ship were his, utterly loyal to their oath
and therefore obedient to his will, yet he seemed to find trusting any Aes Sedai difficult. She
understood, but he was going to have to learn how.

“As you wish,” Merana replied, inclining her head briefly. “Rafela and I have reached a bargain
with the Sea Folk. The Bargain, they call it.” The difference was clear to the ear. Hands lying still on
gray-slashed green skirts, she drew a deep breath. She needed it. “Harine din Togara Two Winds,
Wavemistress of Clan Shodein, speaking for Nesta din Reas Two Moons, Mistress of the Ships to the
Atha’an Miere, and thus binding all the Atha’an Miere, has promised such ships as the Dragon
Reborn needs, to sail when and where he needs them, for whatever purposes he requires.” Merana
did seem to grow a touch pontifical when there were no Wise Ones around; the Wise Ones did not
allow it. “In return, Rafela and I, speaking for you, promised that the Dragon Reborn will not change
any laws of the Atha’an Miere, as he has done among the . . .” For a moment, she faltered. “Forgive
me. I am used to delivering agreements exactly as made. The word they used was ‘shorebound,’ but
what they mean is what you have done in Tear and Cairhien.” A question appeared in her eyes, and
was gone. Perhaps she was wondering whether he had done the same in Illian. She had expressed
relief that he had changed nothing in her native Andor.
“I suppose I can live with that,” he muttered.
“Secondly,” Rafela took up, folding plump hands at her waist, “you must give the Atha’an Miere
land, a square one mile on a side, at every city on navigable water that you control now or come to
control.” She sounded less pompous than her companion, but only just. Nor did she sound entirely
pleased with what she was saying. She was Tairen, after all, and few ports held a tighter control on
their trade than Tear. “Within that area, the laws of the Atha’an Miere are to hold sway above any
others. This agreement must also be made by the rulers of those ports so that . . .” It was her turn to
falter, and her dark cheeks turned a trifle gray.
“So the agreement will survive me?” Rand said dryly. He barked a laugh. “I can live with that,
too.”
“Every city on water?” Dobraine exclaimed. “Do they mean here, too?” He leaped to his feet
and began pacing, spilling more of his wine than Min had. He did not seem to notice. “A mile square?
Under the Light alone knows what peculiar laws? I’ve traveled on a Sea Folk ship, and itis peculiar!
Bare legs are not in it! And what of the customs duties, and docking fees, and . . .” Suddenly he
rounded on Rand. He scowled at the Aes Sedai, who paid him no mind, but it was to Rand he spoke,
in a tone bordering on roughness. “They will ruin Cairhien in a year, my Lord Dragon. They will ruin
any port where you allow them to do this.”
Min agreed, silently, but Rand merely waved a hand and laughed again. “They may think so, but I
know something of this, Dobraine. They didn’t say who chooses the land, so it doesn’t have to be on
the water at all. They’ll have to buy their food from you, and live with your laws when they leave, so
they can’t be too arrogant. At worst, you can collect your customs when the goods come out of their . .
. sanctuary. For the rest . . . If I can accept it, you can, too.” There was no laughter in his voice now,
and Dobraine bowed his head.
Min wondered where he had learned all that. He sounded a king, and one who knew what he
was doing. Maybe Elayne had taught him.
“ ‘Secondly’ implies more,” Rand said to the two Aes Sedai.
Merana and Rafela exchanged glances, unconsciously touched skirts and shawls, and then
Merana spoke, her voice not at all pompous. In fact, it was much too light. “Thirdly, the Dragon
Reborn agrees to keep an ambassador chosen by the Atha’an Miere with him at all times. Harine din
Togara has named herself. She will be accompanied by her Windfinder, her Swordmaster and a
retinue.”
“What?” Rand roared, springing from the chair.

Rafela rushed in, rushed ahead, as though afraid he might cut her off. “And fourthly, the Dragon
Reborn agrees to go promptly to a summons from the Mistress of the Ships, but not more than twice in
any three consecutive years.” She finished panting a little, trying to make the last sound like
extenuation.
The Dragon Scepter flew from the floor behind Rand, and he snagged it out of the air without
looking. His eyes were not ice any more. They were blue fire. “A Sea Folk ambassador clinging to
my heels?” he shouted. “Obey summonses?” He shook the carved spearhead at them, the green-andwhite tassel flailing. “There are a people out there who want to conquer all of us, and might be able
to do it! The Forsaken are out there! The Dark One is waiting! Why didn’t you agree I’d caulk their
hulls while you were about it!”
Normally, Min tried to soothe his temper when it flared, but this time she sat forward and glared
at the Aes Sedai. She agreed with him fully. They had given away the barn to sell a horse!
Rafela actually swayed before that blast, but Merana drew herself up, her own eyes managing a
good imitation of brown fire flecked with gold. “You castigate us?” she snapped in tones as frosty as
her eyes were hot. She was Aes Sedai as the child Min had seen them, regal above queens, powerful
above powers. “You were present in the beginning, ta’veren, and you twisted them as you wanted
them. You could have had them all kneeling to you! But you left! They were not pleased to know they
had been dancing for a ta’veren. Somewhere, they learned to weave shields, and before you were
well off their ship, Rafela and I were shielded. So we could not take advantage with the Power, they
said. More than once, Harine threatened to hang us in the rigging by our toes until we came to our
senses, and I for one believe she meant it! Feel lucky that you have the ships you want, Rand al’Thor.
Harine would have given you a handful! Feel lucky she didn’t want your new boots and that ghastly
throne of yours as well! Oh, by the by, she formally acknowledged you as the Coramoor, may you get
a bellyache from it!”
Min stared at her. Rand and Dobraine stared at her, and the Cairhienin’s jaw hung open. Rafela
stared, her mouth working soundlessly. For that matter, the fire faded from Merana’s eyes, and they
slowly grew wider and wider as if she were just hearing what she had said.
The Dragon Scepter trembled in Rand’s fist. Min had seen his fury swell near to bursting for far
less. She prayed for a way to avoid the explosion, and could not see one.
“It seems,” he said finally, “that the words a ta’veren drags out aren’t always the words he
wants to hear.” He sounded . . . calm; Min was not about to think, sane. “You’ve done well, Merana. I
handed you a dog’s dinner, but you and Rafela have done well.”
The two Aes Sedai swayed, and for a moment, Min thought they might collapse in puddles on the
floor from sheer relief.
“At least we managed to keep the details from Cadsuane,” Rafela said, smoothing her skirts
unsteadily. “There was no way to stop everyone learning we had made some sort of agreement, but
we kept that much from her.”
“Yes,” Merana said breathlessly. “She even waylaid us on the way here. It’s difficult keeping
anything from her, but we did. We didn’t think you’d want her to . . .” She trailed off at the stony look
on Rand’s face.
“Cadsuane again,” he said flatly. He frowned at the carved length of spearhead in his hand, then
tossed it onto a chair as if he did not trust himself with it. “She’s in the Sun Palace, is she? Min, tell
the Maidens outside to carry a message to Cadsuane. She is to attend the Dragon Reborn in all haste.”
“Rand, I don’t think,” Min began uneasily, but Rand cut in. Not harshly, but quite firmly.
“Do it, please, Min. This woman is like a wolf eyeing the sheepfold. I intend to find out what she

wants.”
Min took her time getting up, and dragged her feet to the doors. She was not the only one to think
this a bad idea. Or at least to want to be elsewhere when the Dragon Reborn faced Cadsuane
Melaidhrin. Dobraine passed her on the way to the door, making a hasty bow with barely a pause, and
even Merana and Rafela were out of the room before her, though they made it appear they were not
hurrying. Inside the room, they did, anyway. When Min put her head into the hallway, the two sisters
had caught Dobraine and were scurrying along at little short of a trot.
Strangely, the half-dozen Maidens who had been outside when Min entered earlier had now
grown in number until they lined the corridor as far as she could see in both directions, tall hardfaced women in the grays and browns and grays of the cadin’sor, shoufa wrapped around their heads
with the long black veil hanging down. A good many carried their spears and bull-hide bucklers as if
they expected a battle. Some were playing a finger-game called “knife, paper, stone,” and the rest
were watching intently.
Not so intently that they did not see her, though. When she passed Rand’s message, handtalk
flashed up and down the rows, then two lanky Maidens went trotting off. The others promptly returned
to the game, playing or watching.
Scratching her head in puzzlement, Min went back in. The Maidens often made her nervous, yet
they always had a word for her, sometimes respectful, as to a Wise One, sometimes joking, though
their humor was odd, to say the least. Never had they ignored her like this.
Rand was in the bedchamber. That simple fact set her heart racing. He had his coat off, his
snowy shirt unlaced at neck and cuffs and pulled out of his breeches. Sitting on the foot of the bed, she
leaned back against one of the heavy blackwood bedposts and swung her feet up, crossing her ankles.
She had not had a chance to watch Rand undress himself, and she intended to enjoy it.
Instead of continuing, though, he stood there looking at her. “What can Cadsuane possibly teach
me?” he asked suddenly.
“You, and all the Asha’man,” she replied. That had been her viewing. “I don’t know what, Rand.
I only know you have to learn it. All of you do.” It did not seem he intended to progress beyond letting
his shirt hang down. Sighing, she went on. “You need her, Rand. You can’t afford to make her angry.
You can’t afford to chase her away.” Actually, she did not think fifty Myrddraal and a thousand
Trollocs could chase Cadsuane anywhere, but the point was the same.
A far-off look came into Rand’s eyes, and after a moment, he shook his head. “Why should I
listen to a madman?” he muttered almost under his breath. Light, did he really believe Lews Therin
Telamon spoke in his head? “Let someone know you need them, Min, and they have a hold on you. A
leash, to pull you where they want. I won’t put a halter on my own neck for any Aes Sedai. Not for
anyone!” Slowly his fists unclenched. “You, I need, Min,” he said simply. “Not for your viewings. I
just need you.”
Burn her, but the man could sweep her feet out from under her with a few words!
With a smile as eager as hers, he grasped the bottom of his shirt with both hands and bent to
begin hauling it over his head. Lacing her fingers over her stomach, she settled back to watch.
The three Maidens who marched into the room no longer wore the shoufa that had concealed
their short hair in the corridor. They were empty-handed, and no longer wore those heavy-blade belt
knives, either. That was all Min had time to notice.
Rand’s head and arms were still inside the shirt, and Somara, flaxen-haired and tall even for an
Aiel woman, seized the white linen and tangled it, trapping him. Almost in the same movement, she
kicked him between the legs. With a strangled groan, he bent farther, staggering.

Nesair, fiery-haired and beautiful despite white scars on both sun-dark cheeks, planted a fist in
his right side hard enough to make him stumble sideways.
With a cry, Min launched herself from the bed. She did not know what madness was happening
here, could not even begin to guess. One of her knives came smoothly from each sleeve, and she
threw herself at the Maidens, shouting, “Help! Oh, Rand! Somebody, help!” At least, that was what
she tried to shout.
The third Maiden, Nandera, turned like a snake, and Min found a foot planted in her stomach.
Breath rushed out of her in a wheeze. Her knives flew from numb hands, and she turned a somersault
over the graying Maiden’s foot, landing on her back with a crash that drove out what little air
remained in her. Trying to move, trying to breathe—trying to understand!—all she could do was lie
there and watch.
The three women were quite thorough. Nesair and Nandera pounded Rand with their fists while
Somara held him bent over and caught in his own shirt. Again and again and again they drove studied
blows into Rand’s hard belly, into his right side. Min would have laughed hysterically, had she had
any breath. They were trying to beat him to death, and they very carefully avoid hitting anywhere near
the tender round scar in his left side with the half-healed slash running through it.
She knew very well how hard Rand’s body was, how strong, but no one could stand up to that.
Slowly, his knees folded, and when they thumped to the floor tiles, Nandera and Nesair stood back.
Each nodded, and Somara released her hold on Rand’s shirt. He fell forward on his face. She could
hear him gasping, fighting groans that bubbled up despite his efforts. Kneeling, Somara pulled his
shirt down almost tenderly. He lay there with his cheek on the floor, eyes bulging, struggling for
breath.
Nesair bent to catch a fistful of his hair and jerk his head up. “We won the right for this,” she
growled, “but every Maiden wanted to lay her hands on you. I left my clan for you, Rand al’Thor. I
will not have you spit on me!”
Somara moved a hand as if to smooth hair out of his face, then snatched it back. “This is how we
treat a first-brother who dishonors us, Rand al’Thor,” she said firmly. “The first time. The next, we
will use straps.”
Nandera stood over Rand with fist planted on her hips and a face of stone. “You carry the honor
of Far Dareis Mai, son of a Maiden,” she said grimly. “You promised to call us to dance the spears
for you, and then you ran to battle and left us behind. You will not do this again.”
She stepped over him to stride out, and the other two followed. Only Somara glanced back, and
if sympathy touched her blue eyes, there was none in her voice when she said, “Do not make this
necessary again, son of a Maiden.”
Rand had pushed himself up to hands and knees by the time Min managed to crawl to him. “They
must be mad,” she croaked. Light, but her middle hurt! “Rhuarc will—!” She did not know what
Rhuarc would do. Not enough, whatever it was. “Sorilea.” Sorilea would stake them out in the sun!
To start! “When we tell her—”
“We tell no one,” he said. He almost sounded as if he had his breath back, although he was still
slightly pop-eyed. How could he do that? “They have the right. They’ve earned the right.”
Min recognized that tone much to well. When a man decided to be stubborn, he would sit bare in
a nettle patch and deny to your face that they made his bottom sting! She was almost pleased to hear
him groan as she helped him to his feet. Well, as they helped each other. If he was going to be a pure
wool-headed idiot, he deserved a few bruises!
He eased himself onto the bed, lying back on the heaped pillows, and she snuggled in beside

him. Not what she had been hoping for, but as much as was going to happen, she was sure.
“Not what I was hoping to use this bed for,” he muttered. She was not sure she had been
supposed to hear.
She laughed. “I enjoy you holding me just as much as . . . as the other.” Strangely, he smiled at
her as if he knew she was lying. Her Aunt Miren claimed that was one of the three lies any man would
believe from a woman.
“If I am interrupting,” a woman’s cool voice said from the doorway, “I suppose I could return
when it is more convenient.”
Min jerked away from Rand as though burned, but when he pulled her back, she settled against
him again. She recognized the Aes Sedai standing in the doorway, a plump little Cairhienin with four
thin stripes of color across her full bosom and white slashes in her dark skirts. Daigian Moseneillin
was one of the sisters who had come with Cadsuane. And she was almost as overbearing as Cadsuane
herself, in Min’s opinion.
“Who might you be when you’re at home?” Rand said lazily. “Whoever you are, didn’t anyone
ever teach you to knock?” Min realized that every muscle in the arm holding her was hard as a rock,
though.
The moonstone dangling onto Daigian’s forehead on a thin silver chain swung as she slowly
shook her head. Plainly, she was not pleased. “Cadsuane Sedai received your request,” she said, even
more coolly than before, “and asked me to convey her regrets. She very much wishes to finish the
piece of needlepoint she is working on. Perhaps she might be able to see you another day. If she can
find time.”
“Is that what she said?” Rand asked dangerously.
Daigian sniffed disdainfully. “I will leave you to resume . . . whatever you were doing.” Min
wondered whether she could get away with slapping an Aes Sedai. Daigian eyed her frostily, as if
hearing the thought, and turned to glide from the room.
Rand sat up with a muffled oath. “You tell Cadsuane she can go to the Pit of Doom!” he shouted
after the retreating sister. “Tell her she can rot!”
“It won’t do, Rand,” Min sighed. This was going to be harder than she had thought. “You need
Cadsuane. She doesn’t need you.”
“Doesn’t she?” he said softly, and she shivered. She had only thought his voice was dangerous
before.
Rand prepared carefully, dressing in the green coat again, sending Min with messages for the
Maidens to carry. At least they would still do that. His ribs ached almost as much on his right side as
the wounds did on his left, and his belly felt as he had been beaten with a board. He had promised
them. He seized hold of saidin alone in his bedchamber, unwilling to let even Min see him falter
again. He could keep her safe, at least, somehow, but how could she feel safe if she saw him about to
fall over? He had to be strong, for her sake. He had to be strong, for the world. That bundle of
emotions in the back of his head that was Alanna reminded him of the cost of carelessness. Right then,
Alanna was sulking. She must have pushed a Wise One too far, because if she was sitting, she was
sitting gingerly.
“I still think this is lunacy, Rand al’Thor,” Min said as he placed the Crown of Swords carefully
on his head. He did not want those tiny blades to draw blood again now. “Are you listening to me?
Well, if you intend to go through with it, I’m going with you. You admitted you need me, and you’ll
need me more than ever for this!” She was in full fig, fists on her hips, foot tapping, eyes all but
glowing.

“You’re staying here,” he told her firmly. He was still not sure what he intended to do, not fully,
and he did not want her to see him stumble. He was very afraid he might stumble. He expected an
argument, though.
She frowned at him, and her foot stopped tapping. The angry light in her eyes faded into worry
that vanished in a twinkling. “Well, I suppose you’re old enough to cross the stableyard without your
hand held, sheepherder. Besides, I am falling behind in my reading.”
Dropping into one of the tall gilded chairs, she folded her legs beneath her and picked up the
book she had been reading when he came in. In moments, she seemed totally engrossed in the page
before her.
Rand nodded. That was what he wanted; her here, and safe. Still, she did not have to forget him
so completely.
There were six Maidens squatting in the hallway outside his door. They stared at him flat-eyed,
not speaking, Nandera’s gaze the flattest of all. Though Somara and Nesair came close. He thought
Nesair was Shaido; he would have to keep a hard eye on her.
The Asha’man were waiting, too—Lews Therin muttered darkly of killing in Rand’s head—all
but Narishma with the Dragon on their collars as well as the Sword. Curtly, he ordered Narishma to
stand guard on his apartments, and the man saluted sharply, those dark too-big eyes seeing too much,
faintly accusing. Rand did not think the Maidens would take out their displeasure on Min, but he was
not taking any chances. Light, he had told Narishma everything about the traps he had woven in the
Stone when he sent the man to fetch Callandor. The man was imagining things. Burn him, but that had
been a mad risk to take.
Only madmen never trust. Lews Therin sounded amused. And quite mad. The wounds in Rand’s
side throbbed; they seemed to resonate with each other in distant pain.
“Show me where to find Cadsuane,” he commanded. Nandera rose smoothly to her feet and
started off without a backward glance. He followed, and the others fell in behind him, Dashiva and
Flinn, Morr and Hopwil. He gave them hasty instructions as they walked. Flinn, of all people, tried to
protest, but Rand bore him down; this was no time for quailing. The grizzled onetime Guardsman was
the last Rand had expected it of. Morr or Hopwil, perhaps. If no longer exactly dewy-eyed, they were
still young enough to leave their razors dry as many days as wet. But not Flinn. Nandera’s soft boots
made no sound; their footsteps reverberated from the high square-vaulted ceiling, chasing away
everyone with the shadow of a reason for fear. His wounds pulsed.
Every last person in the Sun Palace knew the Dragon Reborn on sight by now, and they knew
who the black-coated men were, too. Black-liveried servants made deep bows or curtsies, and
hurried to get out of his sight. Most nobles were almost as quick to put distance between themselves
and five men who could channel, going somewhere with purpose on their faces. Ailil watched them
pass with an unreadable expression. Anaiyella simpered, of course, but when Rand glanced back, she
was staring after him with a face to match Nandera’s. Bertome smiled as he made his leg, a dark
smile with neither mirth nor pleasure in it.
Nandera did not speak even when they reached their destination, merely pointed to a closed door
with one of her spears, turned on her heel, and strode back the way they had come. The Car’a’carn
without a single Maiden to guard him. Did they think four Asha’man enough to keep him safe? Or was
her departure another sign of displeasure?
“Do what I told you,” Rand said.
Dashiva gave a jerk as if coming back to himself, then seized the Source. The wide door, carved
in vertical lines, swung open with a bang on a flow of Air. The other three took hold of saidin and

followed Dashiva in, faces grim.
“The Dragon Reborn,” Dashiva’s voice sounded loud, magnified slightly by the Power, “the
King of Illian, the Lord of the Morning, comes to see the woman, Cadsuane Melaidhrin.”
Rand stepped in, standing tall. He did not recognize the other weave Dashiva had created, but
the air seemed to hum with menace, a sense of something inexorable approaching, drawing ever
nearer.
“I sent for you, Cadsuane,” Rand said. He did not use weaves. His voice was hard and flat
enough without aid.
The Green sister he remembered sat beside a small table with an embroidery hoop in her hands,
an opened basket on the polished tabletop spilling out skeins of bright thread from some of its many
compartments. She was exactly as he remembered. That strong face topped by an iron-gray bun
decorated with small dangling golden fish and birds, stars and moons. Those dark eyes, seeming
almost black in her fair face. Cool, considering eyes. Lews Therin gave a wail and fled at the sight of
her.
“Well,” she said, setting the embroidery hoop on the table, “I must say I’ve seen better without
paying. With all I’ve been hearing about you, boy, the least I expected was peals of thunder, trumpets
in the heavens, flashing lights in the sky.” Calmly, she regarded the five stone-faced men who could
channel, which should have been enough to make any Aes Sedai flinch. Calmly, she regarded the
Dragon Reborn. “I hope one of you is at least going to juggle,” she said. “Or eat fire? I’ve always
enjoyed watching gleemen eat fire.”
Flinn barked a laugh before catching himself, and even then raked a hand through his fringe of
hair and seemed to be struggling with amusement. Morr and Hopwil exchanged looks both puzzled
and more than a little outraged. Dashiva smiled unpleasantly, and the weave he was holding grew
stronger, until Rand felt as if he wanted to look over his shoulder to see what was rushing toward
him.
“It is enough that you know I am who I am,” Rand told her. “Dashiva, all of you, wait outside.”
Dashiva opened his mouth as if to protest. That had not been part of Rand’s instructions, but they
were not going to overawe the woman, not this way. The man went, though, muttering to himself.
Hopwil and Morr actually stepped out eagerly, with sidelong glances at Cadsuane. Flinn was the only
one to make a dignified withdrawal, in spite of his limp. And he still seemed amused!
Rand channeled, and a heavy, leopard-carved chair floated into the air from its place by the
wall, spinning end over end in somersaults before settling like a feather in front of Cadsuane. At the
same time, a heavy silver pitcher drifted up from a long, draped table across the room, making a loud
ping as it was suddenly heated; steam gushed from the top, and it tipped over, whirling round and
round like a slow top, as a silver cup darted up to neatly catch the dark pouring.
“Too hot, I think,” Rand said, and the glassed casements leaped from the tall, narrow windows.
Snowflakes billowed in on an icy blast, and the cup soared out through one of the windows, soared
back again, straight to his hand as he sat himself. Let her see how calm she could stay with a madman
staring at her. The dark liquid was tea, too strong after his boiling, and bitter enough to set his teeth on
edge. But the warmth was just right. His skin pebbled in the gusts howling into the room and flapping
tapestries against the walls, but in the Void, that was far away, someone else’s skin.
“The Laurel Crown is prettier than some,” Cadsuane said with a faint smile. Her hair ornaments
swayed whenever the wind rose, and small wisps flailed about her bun, but the only notice she took
was to catch her embroidery hoop just before it was blown from the table. “I prefer that name. But
you can’t expect me to be impressed by crowns. I’ve paddled the bottoms of two reigning kings and

three queens. Not sitting rulers, you understand, once I was done with them, not for a day or so, but it
did get their attention. You can see why crowns don’t impress me, though.”
Rand eased his jaw. Grinding his teeth would not help. He widened his eyes, hoping he looked
insane instead of simply furious. “Most Aes Sedai avoid the Sun Palace,” he told her. “Except for
those who have sworn fealty to me. And those I hold prisoner.” Light, what was he to do with those?
As long as the Wise Ones kept them out of his hair, all was well enough.
“The Aiel seem to think I should come and go as I please,” she said absently, eyeing the hoop in
her hand as if thinking of taking up her needle again. “A matter of some trifling help I gave some boy
or other. Though why anyone but his mother should think him worth it, I can hardly say.”
Rand made another effort not to grind his teeth. The woman had saved his life. Her and Darner
Flinn between them, and plenty of others in the bargain, Min among them. But he still owed Cadsuane
something for that. Burn her. “I want you to be my advisor. I’m King of Illian now, and kings have
Aes Sedai advisors.”
She gave his crown a dismissive glance. “Certainly not. An advisor has to stand and watch her
charge make a muddle much too often to suit me. She also has to take orders, something I am
particularly bad at. Won’t someone else do? Alanna, perhaps?”
Despite himself, Rand sat up straight. Did she know about the bond? Merana had said it was
hard to keep anything from her. No; he could worry later about how much his “faithful” Aes Sedai
were telling Cadsuane. Light, he wished Min could be wrong for once. But he would believe himself
breathing water, first. “I . . .” He could not make himself tell her that he needed her. No halter! “What
if you didn’t have to swear any oaths?”
“I suppose that might work,” she said doubtfully, peering at her cursed stitchery. Her eyes rose
to his. Considering. “You sound . . . uneasy. I don’t like to tell a man he’s afraid even when he has
reason to be. Uneasy over a sister you haven’t turned into a tame lapdog snaring you in some fashion?
Let me see. I can make you a few promises; perhaps they will set your mind at rest. I expect you to
listen, of course—make me waste my breath, and you’ll yelp for it—but I won’t make you do what I
want. I won’t tolerate anyone lying to me, certainly—that’s another thing you’ll find decidedly
uncomfortable—but I don’t expect you to tell me the deepest yearnings of your heart, either. Oh, yes.
Whatever I do, it will be for your own good; not mine, not the good of the White Tower, yours. Now,
does that ease your fears? Pardon me. Your unease.”
Wondering whether he was supposed to laugh, Rand stared at her. “Do they teach you how to do
that?” he demanded. “Make a promise sound a threat, I mean.”
“Oh, I see. You want rules. Most boys do, whatever they say. Very well. Let me see. I cannot
abide incivility. So you will be properly civil to me, to my friends, and my guests. That includes not
channeling at them, in case you haven’t guessed, and holding your temper, which I understand is
memorable. It also takes in your . . . companions in those black coats. A pity if I had to spank you for
something one of them did. Does that suffice? I can make more, if you need them.”
Rand set his cup down beside the chair. The tea had gone cold as well as bitter. Snow was
beginning to pile up in drifts beneath the windows. “I’m the one who’s supposed to go mad, Aes
Sedai, but you already are.” Rising, he strode for the door.
“I do hope you haven’t tried to use Callandor,” she said complacently behind him. “I have heard
it’s vanished from the Stone. You managed to escape once, but you might not twice.”
He stopped short, looking over his shoulder. The woman was pushing that bloody needle through
the cloth stretched on her hoop! The wind gusted, swirling snow around her, and she did not even lift
her head. “What do you mean, escape?”

“What?” She did not look up. “Oh. Very few even in the Tower knew what Callandor is before
you drew it, but there are surprising things hidden in musty corners of the Tower Library. I went
rummaging some years ago, when I first had the suspicion you might be suckling at your mother’s
breast. Just before I decided to go back into retirement. Babes are messy things, and I could not see
how to find you before you stopped dripping at one end or the other.”
“What do you mean?” he demanded roughly.
Cadsuane looked up then, and with her hair flung about and snow settling on her dress, she
looked a queen. “I told you I cannot abide incivility. If you ask for my help again, I expect you to ask
politely. And I will expect an apology for your behavior today!”
“What do you mean about Callandor?”
“It is flawed,” she replied curtly, “lacking the buffer that makes other sa’angreal safe to use.
And it apparently magnifies the taint, inducing wildness of the mind. So long as a man is using it,
anyway. The only safe way for you to use The Sword That Is Not a Sword, the only way to use it
without the risk of killing yourself, or trying to do the Light alone knows what insanity, is linked with
two women, and one of them guiding the flows.”
Trying not to hunch his shoulders, he strode away from her. So it had been not just the wildness
o f saidin around Ebou Dar that had killed Adley. He had murdered the man the moment he sent
Narishma for the thing.
Cadsuane’s voice pursued him. “Remember, boy. You must ask very nicely, and apologize. I
might even agree, if your apology sounds truly sincere.”
Rand barely heard her. He had hoped to use Callandor again, hoped it would be strong enough.
Now only one chance remained, and it terrified him. He seemed to hear another woman’s voice, a
dead woman’s voice. You could challenge the Creator.

CHAPTER
28

Crimsonthorn

I t hardly seemed the setting for the explosion Elayne feared. Harlon Bridge was a village of
moderate size, with three inns and enough houses that no one had to sleep in a hayloft. When
Elayne and Birgitte went downstairs to the common room that morning, Mistress Dill, the round
innkeeper, smiled warmly and offered as much of a curtsy as her size allowed. It was not just
that Elayne was Aes Sedai. Mistress Dill was so pleased that her inn was full, what with the
roads snow-packed, that she bobbed at nearly everyone. At their entrance, Aviendha hastily
gulped the last of her breakfast bread and cheese, brushed a few crumbs from her green dress,
and snatched up her dark cloak to join them.
Outside, the sun was just peeking over the horizon, a low dome of pale yellow. Only a few
clouds marred a beautiful blue sky, and they were white and fluffy, not the sort to carry snow. It
seemed a wonderful day for traveling.
Except that Adeleas was trampling a path up the snowy street, and the white-haired sister was
dragging one of the Kin, Garenia Rosoinde, by her arm. Garenia was a slim-hipped Saldaean who
had spent the last twenty years as a merchant although she looked only a few years older than
Nynaeve did. Normally, her strongly hooked nose gave her a forceful appearance, a woman who
would make hard trading and not back away. Now her dark tilted eyes were large in her face and her
wide mouth hung open, emitting a wordless wail. A growing knot of Kinswomen followed behind,
skirts held high out of the snow, whispering among themselves, with more running from every
direction to join. Reanne and the rest of the Knitting Circle were in the front, all grim-faced except for
Kirstian, who seemed even paler than usual. Alise was there, too, wearing an utterly blank
expression.
Adeleas stopped in front of Elayne and shoved Garenia so hard the woman fell to hands and
knees in the snow. Where she stayed, still wailing. The Kinswomen gathered behind her, more of
their number flocking in.
“I’m bringing this to you because Nynaeve is busy,” the Brown sister told Elayne. She meant that
Nynaeve was enjoying a little time alone with Lan somewhere, but for once, not so much as a hint of a
smile crossed her lips. “Be quiet, child!” she snapped at Garenia. Who promptly went silent. Adeleas

gave a satisfied nod. “This is not Garenia Rosoinde,” she said. “I finally recognized her. Zarya
Alkaese, a novice who ran away just before Vandene and I decided to retire and write our history of
the world. She admitted it, when I confronted her. I’m surprised Careane didn’t recognize her before
this; they were novices together for two years. The law is clear, Elayne. A runaway must be put back
in white as soon as possible and kept under strict discipline until she can be returned to the Tower for
proper punishment. She won’t think of running again after that!”
Elayne nodded slowly, trying to think of what to say. Whether or not Garenia—Zarya—thought
of running again, she would not be allowed the opportunity. She was very strong in the Power; the
Tower would not let her go if it took the rest of her life to earn the shawl. But Elayne was recalling
something she had heard this woman say the first time she met her. The meaning had not registered
then, but now it did. How would Zarya face novice white again after living as her own woman for
seventy years? Worse, those whispers among the Kinswomen had begun to sound like rumbles.
She did not have long to think. Suddenly Kirstian fell to her knees, clutching at Adeleas’ skirts
with one hand. “I submit myself,” she said calmly, her tone a wonder coming from that bloodless
face. “I was enrolled in the novice book almost three hundred years ago, and ran away less than a
year later. I submit myself, and . . . and beg mercy.”
It was white-haired Adeleas’ turn to go wide-eyed. Kirstian was claiming to have run away
from the White Tower when she herself was an infant, if not before she was born! Most of the sisters
still did not really believe the ages claimed by the Kin. Indeed, Kirstian appeared just into her middle
years.
Even so, Adeleas recovered herself quickly. However old the other woman was, Adeleas had
been Aes Sedai about as long as anyone living. She carried an aura of age, and authority. “If that is
so, child,” her voice did falter just a bit at that, “I fear we must put you in white, too. You will still be
punished, but surrendering as you have will gain you some mitigation.”
“That is why I did it.” Kirstian’s steady tone was spoiled somewhat by a hard swallow. She was
almost as strong as Zarya—none of the Knitting Circle were weak—and she would be held very
closely. “I knew you would find me out sooner or later.”
Adeleas nodded as though that were clearly obvious, though how the woman would have been
found out, Elayne could not guess. She very much doubted that Kirstian Chalwin was the name the
woman had been born with. Most of the Kin believed in Aes Sedai omniscience, though. They had, at
least.
“Rubbish!” Sarainya Vostovan’s husky voice cut through the murmured babble of the Kin.
Neither strong enough to become Aes Sedai nor nearly old enough to stand very high among the Kin,
she still stepped from the pack defiantly. “Why should we give them up to the White Tower? We have
helped women run away, and rightly so! It is not part of the rules to give them back!”
“Control yourself!” Reanne said sharply. “Alise, take Sarainya in hand, please. It seems she
forgets too many of the rules she claims to know.”
Alise looked at Reanne, her face still unreadable. Alise, who enforced the Kin’s rules with a
firm hand. “It is not part of our rules to hand runaways back, Reanne,” she said.
Reanne jerked as though struck. “And how do you suggest keeping them?” she demanded finally.
“We have always held runaways apart until we were sure they were no longer hunted, and if they
were found before, we let the sisters take them. That is the rule, Alise. What other rule do you
propose violating? Do you suggest that we actually set ourselves against Aes Sedai?” Ridicule of
such a notion larded her voice, yet Alise stood looking at her, silent.
“Yes!” a voice shouted from the crowd of Kinswomen. “We are many, and they are few!”

Adeleas stared at the crowd in disbelief. Elayne embraced saidar, though she knew the voice was
right—the Kin were too many. She felt Aviendha embracing the Power, and Birgitte setting herself.
Giving herself a shake as if coming to, Alise did something far more practical, certainly far more
effective. “Sarainya,” she said loudly, “you will report to me when we stop tonight, with a switch you
cut yourself before we leave this morning. You, too, Asra; I recognize your voice!” And then, just as
loudly, she said to Reanne, “I will report myself for your judgment when we stop tonight. I don’t see
anyone getting ready!”
The Kinswomen broke up quickly then, heading off to gather their things, yet Elayne saw some of
them talking quietly as they went. When they rode over the bridge across the frozen stream that wound
down beside the village, with Nynaeve incredulous over what she had missed and glaring about for
someone to call down, Sarainya and Asra carried switches—as did Alise—and Zarya and Kirstian
wore hastily found white dresses beneath their dark cloaks. The Windfinders pointed at them and
laughed uproariously. But many of the Kinswomen still talked in clusters, falling silent whenever a
sister or one of the Knitting Circle looked at them. And there was a darkness to their eyes when they
looked at Aes Sedai.
Eight more days of floundering through the snow when it was not falling, and grinding her teeth
in an inn when it was. Eight more days of brooding by the Kin, of staring bleakly at the sisters, days
of strutting by the Windfinders around Kin and Aes Sedai alike. On the morning of the ninth day,
Elayne began to wish everyone had simply gone for everyone else’s throat.
She was just wondering whether they could cover the last ten miles to Caemlyn without a
murder, when Kirstian rapped at her door and darted in without waiting for an answer. The woman’s
plain woolen dress was not the shade of white proper for a novice, and she had regained much of her
dignity somehow, as if knowing her future had smoothed her present, but now she made a hasty curtsy,
almost tripping over her cloak, and her nearly black eyes were anxious. “Nynaeve Sedai, Elayne
Sedai, Lord Lan says you are to come at once,” she said breathlessly. “He told me to speak to no one,
and you aren’t to, either.”
Elayne and Nynaeve exchanged looks with Aviendha and Birgitte. Nynaeve growled something
under her breath about the man not knowing private from public, but it was clear before she blushed
that she did not believe it. Elayne felt Birgitte focus, the drawn arrow hunting a target.
Kirstian did not know what Lan wanted, only where she was to lead them. The small hut outside
of Cullen’s Crossing where Adeleas had taken Ispan the night before. Lan stood outside, his eyes as
cold as the air, and would not let Kirstian enter. When Elayne went inside, she saw why.
Adeleas lay on her side beside an overturned stool, a cup on the rough wooden floor not far from
one outstretched hand. Her eyes stared, and a pool of congealed blood spread out from the deep slash
across her throat. Ispan lay on a small cot, staring at the ceiling. Lips drawn back in a rictus bared her
teeth, and her bulging eyes seemed full of horror. As well they might have, since a wrist-thick
wooden stake stood out from between her breasts. The hammer that had plainly been used to drive it
in lay beside the cot, on the edge of a dark stain that ran back under the cot.
Elayne forced herself to stop thinking about emptying her stomach on the spot. “Light,” she
breathed. “Light! Who could do this? How could anyone do this?” Aviendha shook her head
wonderingly, and Lan did not even bother with that. He just watched nine directions at once, as
though he expected whoever, or whatever, had committed this murder to come through one of the two
tiny windows if not through the walls. Birgitte drew her belt knife, and by her face, she dearly wished
she had her bow. That drawn arrow was stronger than ever in Elayne’s head.
At first, Nynaeve simply stood in one spot, studying the hut’s interior. There was little to see,

aside from the obvious. A second three-legged stool, a rough table holding a flickering lamp, a green
teapot and a second cup, a rude stone fireplace with cold ash on the hearthstone. That was all. The hut
was so small it only took Nynaeve a step to reach the table. Dipping her finger into the teapot, she
touched it to the tip of her tongue, then spat vigorously and emptied the whole teapot into the table in a
wash of tea and tea leaves. Elayne blinked wonderingly.
“What happened?” Vandene asked coolly from the door. Lan moved to bar her way, but she
stopped him with a small gesture. Elayne started to put an arm around her, and received another
raised hand to keep her back. Vandene’s eyes remained on her sister, calm in a face of Aes Sedai
serenity. The dead woman on the cot might as well not have existed. “When I saw all of you heading
this way, I thought . . . We knew we didn’t have many years remaining, but . . .” Her voice sounded
serenity itself, but small wonder if that was a mask. “What have you found, Nynaeve?”
Sympathy looked odd on Nynaeve’s face. Clearing her throat, she pointed to the tea leaves
without touching them. To white shavings among the matted black leaves. “This is crimsonthorn root,”
she said, trying to sound matter-of-fact and failing. “It’s sweet, so you might miss it in tea unless you
know what it is, especially if you take a lot of honey.”
Vandene nodded, never taking her eyes from her sister. “Adeleas developed a taste for sweet tea
in Ebou Dar.”
“A little kills pain,” Nynaeve said. “This much . . . This much kills, but slowly. Even a few sips
would be enough.” Taking a deep breath, she added, “They might have remained conscious for hours.
Not able to move, but aware. Either whoever did this didn’t want to risk someone coming too soon
with an antidote—not that I know one, for a brew this strong—or else they wanted one or the other to
know who was killing them.” Elayne gasped at the brutality, but Vandene simply nodded.
“Ispan, I think, since they appear to have taken the most time with her.” The white-haired Green
almost seemed to be thinking aloud, working out a puzzle. Cutting a throat took less time than driving
a stake through someone’s heart. The calm of her made Elayne’s skin crawl. “Adeleas would never
have accepted anything to drink from someone she didn’t know, not out here with Ispan. Those two
facts name her killer, in a way. A Dark-friend, and one of our party. One of us.” Elayne felt two
chills, her own, and Birgitte’s.
“One of us,” Nynaeve agreed sadly. Aviendha began testing the edge of her belt knife on her
thumb, and for once, Elayne felt no objection.
Vandene asked to be left alone with her sister for a few moments, and sat on the floor to cradle
Adeleas in her arms before they were out of the door. Jaem, Vandene’s gnarled old Warder, was
waiting outside with a shivering Kirstian.
Suddenly a wail burst out inside the hut, the full-throated cry of a woman mourning the loss of
everything. Nynaeve, of all people, turned to go back, but Lan laid a hand on her arm, and Jaem
planted himself before the door with eyes not much warmer than Lan’s. There was nothing to do but
leave them, Vandene to shriek her pain, and Jaem to guard her in it. And share it, Elayne realized,
feeling that knot of emotions in her head that was Birgitte. She shivered, and Birgitte put an arm
around her shoulders. Aviendha did the same from the other side, and motioned for Nynaeve to join
them, which she did, after a moment. The murder Elayne had thought of so lightly had come, one of
their companions was a Darkfriend, and the day suddenly felt cold enough to shatter bones, but there
was a warmth in the closeness of her friends.
The last ten funereal miles to Caemlyn took two days in the snow, with even the Windfinders
decently subdued. Not that they pushed Merilille any less hard. Not that Kin stopped talking, and
falling silent whenever a sister or one of the Knitting Circle came near. Vandene, with her sister’s

silver-mounted saddle on her horse, appeared as serene as she had at Adeleas’ graveside, but Jaem’s
eyes carried a silent promise of death that surely rode in Vandene’s heart, too. Elayne could not have
been happier to see the walls and towers of Caemlyn if the very sight had given her the Rose Crown
and brought back Adeleas.
Even Caemlyn, one of the great cities of the world, had never seen the likes of their party before,
and once inside the fifty-foot walls of gray stone they attracted notice as they crossed the New City
along wide, slush-filled streets bustling with people and carts and wagons. Shopkeepers stood in
their doorways and gaped. Wagon drivers reined in their teams to stare. Towering Aielmen and tall
Maidens eyed them from every corner, it seemed. The people seemed to take no notice of the Aiel,
but Elayne did. She loved Aviendha as she did herself, more, but she could not love an army of armed
Aiel walking Caemlyn’s streets.
The Inner City, ringed by towered walls of silver-streaked white, was a remembered delight,
and Elayne finally began to feel that she was coming home. The streets followed the curves of the
hills, and every rise presented a new vista of snow-covered parks and monuments laid out to be seen
from above as well as up close, of brightly tiled towers shining with a hundred colors in the afternoon
sun. And then the Royal Palace itself was before them, a confection of pale spires and golden domes
and intricate stonework traceries. The banner of Andor waved from nearly every prominence, the
White Lion on red. And from the others, the Dragon Banner or the Banner of Light.
At the tall gilded gates of the Palace, Elayne rode forward alone in her travel-stained gray riding
dress. Tradition and legend said women who first approached the Palace in splendor always failed.
She had made clear that she had to do it alone, yet she almost wished Aviendha and Birgitte had
succeeded in overruling her. Half the two dozen guards in front of the gates were Aiel Maidens, the
others men in blue helmets and blue coats with a red-and-gold Dragon marching across the chest.
“I am Elayne Trakand,” she announced loudly, surprised at how calm she sounded. Her voice
carried, and across the great plaza people turned from staring at her companions to stare at her. The
ancient formula rolled from her tongue. “In the name of House Trakand, by right of descent from
Ishara, I have come to claim the Lion Throne of Andor, if the Light wills it so.”
The gates opened wide.
It would not be that easy, of course. Even possession of the Palace was not enough to hold the
throne of Andor by itself. Passing her companions into the care of an astonished Reene Harfor—and
very pleased to see that the graying First Maid, round and as regal as any queen, still had the Palace
in her capable hands—and a coterie of servants in red-and-white livery, Elayne hurried to the Grand
Hall, the throne room of Andor. Alone, again. This was not part of the ritual, not yet. She should have
been going to change into the red silk with the pearl-worked bodice and white lions climbing the
sleeves, but she felt compelled. This time, not even Nynaeve tried to object.
White columns twenty paces high marched down the sides of the Grand Hall. The throne room
was empty, still. That would not last long. Clear afternoon light through the glassed casements in tall
windows along the walls mingled with the colored light through the great windows set in the ceiling,
where the White Lion of Andor alternated with scenes of Andoran victories and the faces of the
land’s earliest queens, beginning with Ishara herself, as dark as any of the Atha’an Miere, as full of
authority as any Aes Sedai. No ruler of Andor could forget herself with the predecessors who had
forged this nation staring down at her.
One thing she feared to see—the huge monstrosity of a throne, all gilded Dragons, that she had
seen standing on the dais at the far end of the Hall in Tel’aran’rhiod. It was not there, thank the Light.
The Lion Throne no longer rested on a tall plinth like some trophy, either, but kept its proper place

upon the dais, a massive chair, carved and gilded, but sized for a woman. The White Lion, picked out
in moonstones on a field of rubies, would stand above the head of any woman who sat there. No man
could feel at his ease sitting on that throne, because, so legend said, he would know he had sealed his
doom. Elayne thought it more likely the builders had simply made sure a man would not fit on it
easily.
Climbing the white marble steps of the dais, she laid a hand on one arm of the throne. She had no
right to sit on it herself, not yet. Not until she was acknowledged Queen. But taking oaths on the Lion
Throne was a custom as old as Andor. She had to resist the desire to simply fall on her knees and
weep into the throne’s seat. Reconciled to her mother’s death she might be, but this brought back all
the pain. She could not break down now.
“Under the Light, I will honor your memory, Mother,” she said softly. “I will honor the name of
Morgase Trakand, and try to bring only honor to House Trakand.”
“I ordered the guards to keep the curious and the favor-seekers away. I suspected you might want
to be alone here for a time.”
Elayne turned slowly to face Dyelin Taravin, as the golden-haired woman walked the length of
the Grand Hall. Dyelin had been one of her mother’s earliest supporters in her own quest for the
throne. There was more gray in her hair than Elayne remembered, more lines at the corners of her
eyes. She was still quite beautiful. A strong woman. And powerful as friend or foe.
She stopped at the foot of the dais, looking up. “I’ve been hearing for two days that you were
alive, but I didn’t really believe it until now. You’ve come to accept the throne from the Dragon
Reborn, then?”
“I claim the throne by my own right, Dyelin, with my own hand. The Lion Throne is no bauble to
be accepted from a man.” Dyelin nodded, as at self-evident truth. Which it was, to any Andoran.
“How do you stand, Dyelin? With Trakand, or against? I have heard your name often on my way
here.”
“Since you claim the throne by your own right, with.” Few people could sound as dry as she.
Elayne sat down on the top step, and motioned the older woman to join her. “There are a few
obstacles, of course,” Dyelin went on as she gathered her blue skirts to sit. “There have been several
claimants already, as you may know. Naean and Elenia, I have securely locked up. On a charge of
treason that most people seem willing to accept. For the time being. Elenia’s husband is still active
for her, though quietly, and Arymilla has announced a claim, the silly goose. She’s getting support of a
kind, but nothing that need worry you. Your real worries—aside from Aiel all over the city waiting
for the Dragon Reborn to come back—are Aemlyn, Arathelle, and Pelivar. For the moment, Luan and
Ellorien will be behind you, but they might go over to those three.”
A very succinct list, delivered in a tone suitable for discussing a possible horse trade. Naean
and Elenia she knew about, if not that Jarid still thought his wife had a chance at the throne. Arymilla
was a goose to believe she would be accepted, whatever her support. The last five names were
worrying, though. Each had been as strong a supporter of her mother, as had Dyelin, and each led a
strong House.
“So Arathelle and Aemlyn want the throne,” Elayne murmured. “I can’t believe it of Ellorien,
not for herself.” Pelivar might be acting for one of his daughters, but Luan had only granddaughters,
none near old enough. “You spoke as if they might unite, all five Houses. Behind whom?” That would
be a dire threat.
Smiling, Dyelin propped her chin in her hand. “They seem to think I should have the throne.
Now, what do you intend about the Dragon Reborn? He hasn’t been back here in some time, but he

can pop out of the air, it seems.”
Elayne squeezed her eyes shut for a moment, but when she opened them, she was still sitting on
the steps of the dais in the Grand Hall, and Dyelin was still smiling at her. Her brother fought for
Elaida, and her half-brother was a Whitecloak. She had filled the Palace with women who might turn
on one another at any moment, not to mention the fact that one was a Darkfriend, maybe even Black
Ajah. And the strongest threat she faced in claiming the throne, a very strong one, stood behind a
woman who said she supported Elayne. The world was quite mad. She might as well add her bit.
“I mean to bond him my Warder,” she said, and went on before the other woman could more than
blink in astonishment. “I also hope to marry him. Those things have nothing to do with the Lion
Throne, however. The very first thing I intend . . .”
As she went on, Dyelin began to laugh. Elayne wished she knew whether it was from delight
over her plans or because Dyelin saw her own path to the Lion Throne being made smooth. At least
she knew what she faced, now.
Riding into Caemlyn, Daved Hanlon could not help thinking what a city for the looting it was. In
his years soldiering, he had seen many villages and towns looted, and once, twenty years ago, a great
city, Cairhien, after the Aiel left. Strange that all these Aiel had left Caemlyn so apparently untouched,
but then, if the tallest towers in Cairhien had not been burning, it might have been hard to know they
had been there; plenty of gold, among other things, lying about for the picking up, and plenty of men to
do the picking. He could see these broad streets full of horsemen and fleeing people, fat merchants
who would give up their gold before the knife touched them in the hope their lives would be spared,
slim girls and plump women so terrified when they were dragged into a corner that they could hardly
manage to squeal, much less struggle. He had seen those things and done them, and he hoped to again.
Not in Caemlyn, though, he admitted with a sigh. If the orders that sent him here had been the sort he
could disobey, he would have gone where the pickings might not be so rich, but definitely easier to
pluck.
His instructions had been clear. Stabling his horse at The Red Bull, in the New City, he walked
a mile to a tall stone house on a side street, the house of a wealthy merchant discreet about her gold,
marked with a tiny painted sigil on the doors, a red heart on a golden hand. The hulking fellow who
let him in was no merchant’s servant, with his sunken knuckles and sullen eyes. Without a word, the
huge man led him deeper into the house, then down, toward the basements. Hanlon eased his sword in
its scabbard. Among the things he had seen were men and women, failures, led to their own very
elaborate executions. He did not think he had failed, but then again, he had hardly succeeded. He had
followed orders, though. Which was not always enough.
In the rough stone basement, lit by gilded lamps set all around, his eyes went first to a pretty
woman in a lace-trimmed dress of scarlet silk, with her hair caught in frothy lace net. He did not
know who this Lady Shiaine was, but his orders had been to obey her. He made his best leg, smiling.
She simply looked at him, as if waiting for him to notice what else the basement held.
He could hardly have missed it, since except for a few casks the room held only a large heavy
table, decorated in a very strange fashion. Two ovals had been cut in the tabletop, and from one stuck
the head and shoulders of a man, his head wrenched back against the wooden surface and held there
by means of leather straps nailed to the tabletop and fastened to a block of wood jammed between his
teeth. A woman, prepared the same, provided the other decoration. Beneath the table, they knelt with
wrists tied to ankles. Quite securely held for any sort of pleasure. The man had a touch of gray in his
hair and the face of a lord, but unsurprisingly, his deep-set eyes rolled wildly. The woman’s hair,
spread out on the table, was dark and glossy, but her face was a little long for Hanlon’s taste.

Suddenly he really saw her face, and his hand leaped to his sword before he could stop it.
Releasing the hilt took some effort, which he made pains to hide. An Aes Sedai’s face, but an Aes
Sedai who let herself be fastened like that was no threat.
“So you have some brains,” Shiaine said. By her accents, she was a noble, and she certainly had
the commanding air, sweeping around the table to peer down into the bound man’s face. “I asked the
Great Master Moridin to send me a man with brains. Poor Jaichim here has very few.”
Hanlon frowned, and smoothed it away immediately. His orders had come from Moghedien
herself. Who in the Pit of Doom was Moridin? It did not matter. His orders had come from
Moghedien; that was enough.
The hulking fellow handed Shiaine a funnel, which she fitted into a hole bored through the block
of wood between this Jaichim’s teeth. The man’s eyes seemed ready to leap from his head. “Poor
Jaichim here failed very badly,” Shiaine said, smiling like a fox looking at a chicken. “Moridin
wishes him punished. Poor Jaichim does like his brandy.”
She stepped back, not so far that she could not see clearly, and Hanlon gave a start as the hulking
man came to the table with one of the casks. Hanlon did think he could have lifted the thing unaided,
but the big man tipped it easily. The bound man shrieked once, and then a stream of dark liquid was
pouring from the cask into the funnel, turning his cry to gurgling. The rough smell of crude brandy
filled the air. Secured as he was, the man fought, thrashing about, even managing to heave the table
sideways, but the brandy kept pouring. Bubbles rose in the funnel as he tried to shout or scream, but
the steady stream never faltered. And then his thrashing slowed and stopped. Wide, glazing eyes
stared up the ceiling, and brandy trickled from his nostrils. The big fellow still did not stop until the
last drops fell from an empty cask.
“I think poor Jaichim has finally had enough brandy,” Shiaine said, and laughed in delight.
Hanlon nodded. He supposed the man had, at that. He wondered who he had been.
Shiaine was not quite finished. At a gesture from her, the hulking man ripped one of the straps
holding the Aes Sedai’s gag off of its nail. Hanlon thought the wooden block might have loosened a
few of her teeth coming out of her mouth, but if so, she did not waste time on them. She began
babbling before the fellow let go of the strap.
“I will obey you!” she howled. “I will obey, as the Great Master commanded! He set the shield
on me to dissolve so I could obey! He told me so! Let me prove myself! I will crawl! I am a worm,
and you are the sun! Oh, please! Please! Please!”
Shiaine stifled words if not whimpers by putting a hand over the Aes Sedai’s mouth. “How do I
know you won’t fail again, Falion? You have failed before, and Moridin left your punishment to me.
He gave me another; do I need two of you? I may give you a second chance to plead your case, Falion
—perhaps—but if I do, you will have to convince me. I will expect true enthusiasm.”
Falion began screaming pleas again, making extravagant promises, the moment Shiaine’s hand
moved, but soon enough she was reduced to wordless shrieks and tears as the gag was replaced, the
nail driven through the strap again, and Jaichim’s funnel placed above her gaping throat. The hulking
man stood another cask on the table beside her head. The Aes Sedai seemed to go mad, bulging eyes
rolling, flinging herself about below the table till it trembled.
Hanlon was impressed. An Aes Sedai must be harder to break than a plump merchant or his
round-cheeked daughter. Still, she had had the help of one of the Chosen, it seemed. Realizing that
Shiaine was looking at him, he stopped smiling down at Falion. His first rule in life was never to
offend those the Chosen set above him.
“Tell me, Hanlon,” Shiaine said, “how would you like to put your hands on a queen?”

He licked his lips in spite of himself. A queen? That, he had never done.

A Cup of Sleep

D

“
on’t be an utter woolhead, Rand,” Min said. Making herself remain seated, she crossed
her legs and kicked her foot idly, but she could not keep exasperation out of her voice. “Go to
her! Speak to her!”
“Why?” he snapped. “I know which letter to believe, now. It’s better this way. She’s safe, now.
From anyone who wants to strike at me. Safe from me! It’s better!” But he stalked up and down in his
shirtsleeves between the two rows of chairs in front of the Dragon Throne, his fists white-knuckle
hard, glaring to beat the black clouds beyond the casements that were laying a new blanket of snow on
Cairhien.
Min exchanged looks with Fedwin Morr, who stood by the sun-carved doors. The Maidens now
let anyone who was not an obvious threat walk in unannounced, but those Rand did not want to see
this morning would be turned away by the husky boy. He wore the Dragon and Sword on his black
collar, and Min knew he had already seen more battles—more horror—than most men three times his
age, yet he was a boy. Today, casting uneasy glances at Rand, he seemed younger than ever. The
sword on his hip still looked out of place, to her.
“The Dragon Reborn is a man, Fedwin,” she said. “And like any man, he’s sulking because he
thinks a woman doesn’t want to see him again.”
Goggling, the boy jerked as if she had goosed him. Rand stopped to scowl at her sullenly. All
that kept her from laughing was knowing that he was hiding pain as real as any stab wound. That, and
the sure knowledge that he would be as hurt if she had done what had been done. Not that she would
ever have the chance to rip down his banners, but the point applied. Rand had been stunned at first by
the news Taim brought from Caemlyn at dawn, but as soon as the man left, he had stopped looking
like a poleaxed bull and started . . . This!
Standing, she adjusted her pale green coat, folded her arms beneath her breasts, and confronted
him directly. “What else can it be?” she asked calmly. Well, she tried for calm, and almost made it.
She loved the man, but after a morning of this, she wanted to box his ears soundly. “You haven’t
mentioned Mat twice, and you don’t know whether he’s even alive.”
“Mat’s alive,” Rand snarled. “I’d know if he was dead. What do you mean I’m—!” His jaw
clenched as if he could not make himself say the word.
“Sulking,” she provided. “Soon, you’ll be pouting. Some women think men are prettier when
they pout. I’m not one of them.” Well, enough of that. His face had darkened, and he was not blushing.

“Haven’t you twisted yourself into knots to make sure she got the throne of Andor? Which is hers by
right, might I add. Didn’t you say you wanted her to have Andor whole, not ripped apart like Cairhien
or Tear?”
“I did!” he roared. “And now it’s hers, and she wants me out of it! Good enough, I say! And
don’t tell me again to stop shouting! I’m not—!” He realized that he was, and clamped his teeth shut.
A low growl came from his throat. Morr set to studying one of his buttons, twisting it back and forth.
He had been doing a lot of that this morning.
Min kept her face smooth. She was not going to slap him, and he was too big for her to spank.
“Andor is hers, just as you wanted,” she said. Calmly. Almost. “None of the Forsaken are going after
her now she’s torn your banners down.” A dangerous light appeared in those blue-gray eyes, but she
pressed on. “Just as you wanted. And you can’t believe she’s siding with your enemies. Andor will
follow the Dragon Reborn, and you know it. So the only reason for you to be in a snit is because you
think she doesn’t want to see you. Go to her, you fool!” The next part was the hardest to say. “Before
you can say two words, she’ll be kissing you.” Light, she loved Elayne almost as much as she did
Rand—maybe as much, in a very different way—but how was a woman to compete with a beautiful
golden-haired queen who had a powerful nation at her beck and call?
“I am not . . . angry,” Rand said in a tight voice. And started pacing again. Min considered
kicking him square in the bottom. Hard.
One of the doors opened to admit leathery white-haired Sorilea, who brushed Morr aside even
as he was looking to see whether Rand wanted her allowed entry. Rand opened his mouth—angrily,
whatever he chose to claim—and five women in thick black robes damp with melted snow followed
the Wise One into the room, hands folded, eyes down, and deep hoods not quite hiding their faces.
Their feet were wrapped in rags.
Min’s scalp prickled. To her eyes, images and auras danced and vanished and were replaced
around all six women, just as around Rand. She had been hoping he had forgotten those five were
alive. What in the name of the Light was that wicked old woman doing?
Sorilea gestured once in a clatter of gold and ivory bracelets, and the five hastily arranged
themselves in a line atop the golden Rising Sun set in the stone floor. Rand strode along that row,
stripping back hoods, baring faces that he stared into cold-eyed.
Every one of the black-robed women was unwashed, her hair lank and dirty with sweat. Elza
Penfell, a Green sister, met his gaze eagerly, a strangely fervent look on her face. Nesune Bihara, a
slender Brown, studied him as intently as he did her. Sarene Nemdahl, so beautiful even in her dirt
that you thought her agelessness must be natural, appeared to be holding to her White Ajah coolness
by a fingernail. Beldeine Nyram, too new to the shawl to have the ageless features, essayed an
uncertain smile that melted under his stare. Erian Boroleos, pale and almost as lovely as Sarene,
flinched, then visibly forced herself to look into that frigid gaze. Those last two also were Green, and
all five had been among the sisters who kidnapped him on Elaida’s orders. Some had been among
those who tortured him while trying to carry him to Tar Valon. Sometimes Rand still woke, sweating
and panting, mumbling about being confined, being beaten. Min hoped she did not see murder in his
stare.
“These were named da’tsang, Rand al’Thor,” Sorilea said. “I think they feel their shame in the
bone, now. Erian Boroleos was the first to ask to be beaten as you were, sunrise and sunset, but now
each has done so. That plea has been granted. Each has asked to serve you however she may. The toh
for their betrayal cannot be met,” her voice darkened for a moment; to the Aiel, the betrayal of the
kidnapping was far worse than what they had done after, “yet they know their shame, and they wish to

try. We have decided to leave the choice to you.”
Min frowned. Leave the choice to him? Wise Ones rarely left any choice they could make to
anyone else. Sorilea never did. The sinewy Wise One casually shifted her dark shawl on her
shoulders and watched Rand as if this was of no importance at all. But she shot one blue ice glance at
Min, and suddenly Min was sure that if she said the wrong thing here, that bony old woman would
have her hide. It was not a viewing. She just knew Sorilea better than she wanted to, by now.
Determinedly she set to studying what was appearing and vanishing around the women. No easy
task when they stood so close together she could not be certain whether a particular image belonged
to one woman or the woman next to her. At least the auras were always certain. Light, let her be able
to understand at least some of what she saw!
Rand took Sorilea’s announcement coolly, on the surface. He rubbed his hands together slowly,
then thoughtfully examined the herons branded on his palms. He examined each of those Aes Sedai
faces in turn. Finally, he focused on Erian.
“Why?” he asked her in a mild voice. “I killed two of your Warders. Why?” Min winced. Rand
was many things, but seldom mild. And Erian was one of the few who had beaten him more than once.
The pale Illianer sister straightened. Images danced, and auras flashed and were gone. Nothing
Min could read. Dirty-faced and her long black hair matted, Erian gathered Aes Sedai authority
around her and met his gaze levelly. But her answer came simply and directly. “We did be wrong in
taking you. I have considered long on it. You must fight the Last Battle, and we must help you. If you
will no accept me, I do understand, but I will help as you do require if you will allow.”
Rand stared at her without expression.
He put that same one-word question to each, and their answers were as different as the women.
“The Green is the Battle Ajah,” Beldeine told him proudly, and despite smudges on her cheeks
and dark circles beneath her eyes, she did look a Queen of Battles. But then, Saldaean women seemed
to find that second nature. “When you go to Tarmon Gai’don, the Green must be there. I will follow, if
you will accept me.” Light, she was going to bond an Asha’man as a Warder! How . . . ? No; it was
not important now.
“What we did was logical at the time.” Sarene’s tightly held cool serenity slipped into clear
worry, and she shook her head. “I say that to explain, not to exculpate. Circumstances have changed.
For you, the logical course might seem to . . .” She drew a decidedly unsteady breath. Images and
auras; a tempestuous love affair, of all things! The woman was ice, however beautiful. And there was
nothing useful in knowing some man would melt her! “To send us back to captivity,” she went on, “or
even execute us. For me, logic says I must serve you.”
Nesune tilted her head, and her nearly black eyes seemed to be trying to store away every scrap
of him. One red-and-green aura spoke of honors, and fame. A huge building appeared above her head
and vanished. A library she would found. “I want to study you,” she said simply. “I can hardly do that
carrying stones or digging holes. They do leave plenty of time for thought, but serving you seems a
fair exchange for what I might learn.” Rand blinked at the directness of that, but otherwise, his
expression did not alter.
The most surprising answer came from Elza, in her manner of delivery more than the words.
Sinking to her knees, she gazed up at Rand with feverish eyes. Her whole face seemed to shine with
fervor. Auras flared and images cascaded around her, telling nothing. “You are the Dragon Reborn,”
she said breathlessly. “You must be there for the Last Battle. I must help you be there! Whatever is
necessary, I will do!” And she flung herself facedown, pressing her lips to the polished stone floor in
front of his boots. Even Sorilea looked taken aback, and Sarene’s mouth dropped open. Morr gaped at

her and hastily returned to twisting his button. Min thought he giggled nervously, almost under his
breath.
Turning on his heel, Rand stalked halfway to the Dragon Throne, where his scepter and the
crown of Illian rested atop his gold-embroidered red coat. His face was so bleak that Min wanted to
rush to him no matter who was watching, but she continued to study the Aes Sedai. And Sorilea. She
had never seen anything really useful around that white-haired harridan.
Abruptly, Rand turned back, striding toward the line of women so quickly that Beldeine and
Sarene stepped back. A sharp gesture from Sorilea jerked them into place again.
“Would you accept being confined in a box?” His voice grated, stone grinding on frozen stone.
“Locked in a chest all day, and beaten before you go in and when you come out?” That was what they
had done to him.
“Yes!” Elza moaned against the floor. “Whatever I must do, I will!”
“If you do require it,” Erian managed shakily, and, faces aghast, the others nodded slowly.
Min stared in amazement, knotting her fists in her coat pockets. That he might think of getting his
own back in the same manner seemed almost natural, but she had to stop it, somehow. She knew him
better than he did himself; she knew where he was hard as a knife blade, and where he was
vulnerable no matter how he denied it. He would never forgive himself this. But how? Fury contorted
his face, and he shook his head as he did when arguing with that voice he heard. He muttered one
word aloud that she understood. Ta’veren. Sorilea stood there calmly examining him as closely as
Nesune did. Not even the threat of the chest shook the Brown. Except for Elza, still moaning and
kissing the floor, the others were hollow-eyed, as if seeing themselves doubled up and bound as he
had been.
Among all of those images spilling around Rand and the women, suddenly an aura flashed, blue
and yellow tinged with green, encompassing them all. And Min knew its meaning. She gasped, half in
surprise, half in relief.
“They will serve you, each in her fashion, Rand,” she said hurriedly. “I saw it.” Sorilea would
serve him? Suddenly Min wondered exactly what “in her fashion” meant. The words came with the
knowing, but she did not always know what the words themselves meant. But they would serve; that
much was plain.
The fury drained from Rand’s face as he silently studied the Aes Sedai. Some of them glanced at
Min with raised eyebrows, obviously marveling that a few words from her carried so much weight,
but for the most part, they watched Rand and hardly seemed to breathe. Even Elza lifted her head to
gaze up at him. Sorilea gave Min one quick look, and the faintest nod. Approving, Min thought. So the
old woman pretended not to care one way or the other, did she?
At last, Rand spoke. “You can swear to me as Kiruna and the others did. That, or go back to
wherever the Wise Ones have been keeping you. I’ll accept nothing less.” Despite a hint of demand in
his voice, he looked as if he, too, did not care, arms folded, eyes impatient. The oath he demanded of
them came out in a rush.
Min did not expect quibbles, not after her viewing, yet it was still a surprise when Elza
scrambled up to her knees, and the others lowered themselves to theirs. In ragged unison, five more
Aes Sedai swore under the Light and by their hope of salvation to serve the Dragon Reborn faithfully
until the Last Battle had come and gone. Nesune delivered the words as though examining each one,
Sarene as if stating a principle of logic, Elza wearing a wide, victorious smile, but they all swore.
How many Aes Sedai would he gather around him?
With the oath, Rand seemed to lose interest. “Find them clothes and put them with your other

‘apprentices,’ ” he told Sorilea absently. He was frowning, but not at her or the Aes Sedai. “How
many do you think you’ll end up with?” Min almost jumped at the echo of her own thought.
“However many are necessary,” Sorilea said dryly. “I think more will come.” She clapped her
hands once and gestured, and the five sisters sprang to their feet. Only Nesune looked surprised at the
alacrity with which they had obeyed. Sorilea smiled, a very satisfied smile for an Aiel, and Min did
not think it was caused by the other women’s obedience.
Nodding, Rand turned away. He was already beginning to pace again, already beginning to
scowl over Elayne. Min settled into her chair once more, wishing she had one of Master Fel’s books
to read. Or to throw at Rand. Well, one of Master Fel’s to read, and someone else’s to throw.
Sorilea herded the black-clad sisters out of the room, but at the last, she paused with one hand
holding a door and looked back at Rand striding away from her toward the gilded throne. Her lips
pursed thoughtfully. “That woman, Cadsuane Melaidhrin, is beneath this roof again today,” she said at
last, to his back. “I think she believes you are afraid of her, Rand al’Thor, the way you avoid her
whereabouts.” With that, she left.
For a long moment, Rand stood staring at the throne. Or maybe at something beyond it. Abruptly,
he gave himself a shake and strode the remaining distance to pick up the Crown of Swords. On the
point of setting it on his head, though, he hesitated, then put it back. Donning the coat, he left crown
and scepter where they lay.
“I mean to find out what Cadsuane wants,” he announced. “She doesn’t come to the palace every
day because she likes a trip through the snow. Will you come with me, Min? Maybe you’ll have a
viewing.”
She was on her feet faster than any of those Aes Sedai. A visit with Cadsuane would likely be as
pleasurable as a visit with Sorilea, yet anything was better than sitting there alone. Besides, maybe
she would have a viewing. Fedwin fell in behind her and Rand with an alert look in his eyes.
The six Maidens outside in the tall vaulted hallway rose, but they did not follow. Somara was
the only one Min knew; she gave Min a brief smile, and Rand a flat, disapproving stare. The others
glowered. The Maidens had accepted his explanation about why he had gone without them in the first
place, so any watchers would believe for as long as possible that he was still in Cairhien, but they
still demanded to know why he had not sent for them afterward, and Rand had had no answers. He
muttered something under his breath, and quickened his pace so Min had to stretch her legs to keep
up.
“Watch Cadsuane carefully, Min,” he said. “And you, too, Morr. She’s up to some Aes Sedai
scheme, but burn me if I can see what. I don’t know. There’s—”
A stone wall seemed to strike Min from behind; she thought she heard roaring, crashing. And
then Rand was turning her over—she was lying on the floor?—looking down at her with the first fear
she remembered seeing in those morning-blue eyes. It only faded when she sat up, coughing. The air
was full of dust! And then she saw the corridor.
The Maidens were gone from in front of Rand’s doors. The doors themselves were gone, along
with most of the wall, and a jagged hole nearly as big gaped in the wall opposite. She could see into
his apartments clearly despite the dust, into devastation. Massive piles of rubble lay everywhere, and
above, the ceiling yawned open to the sky. Snow swirled down onto flames dancing among the
rubble. One of the massive blackwood posts of his bed stuck burning out of shattered stone, and she
realized she could see all the way outside to the stepped towers veiled by the snowfall. It was as if a
huge hammer had smashed into the Sun Palace. And had they been in there, instead of going to see
Cadsuane . . . Min shivered.

“What . . . ?” she began unsteadily, then abandoned the useless question. Any fool would see
what had happened. “Who?” she asked instead.
Covered in dust, hair every which way, and with tears in their coats, the two men looked as if
they had been rolled along the corridor, and perhaps they had. She thought they were all a good ten
paces farther from the doors than she remembered. From where the doors had been. In the distance,
anxious shouts rose, echoing along the halls. Neither man answered her.
“Can I trust you, Morr?” Rand asked.
Fedwin met his gaze openly. “With your life, my Lord Dragon,” he said simply.
“That’s what I am trusting you with,” Rand said. His fingers brushed her cheek, and then he
stood abruptly. “Guard her with your life, Morr.” Hard as steel, his voice. Grim as death. “If they’re
still in the Palace, they’ll feel you try to make a gateway, and strike before you can finish. Don’t
channel at all unless you must, but be ready. Take her down to the servants’ quarters, and kill anyone
or anything that tries to get to her. Anyone!”
With a last look down at her—oh, Light, any other time, she would have thought she could die
happily, seeing that look in his eyes!—he went running, away from the ruination. Away from her.
Whoever had tried to kill him would be hunting for him.
Morr patted her on the arm with a dusty hand and gave her a boyish grin. “Don’t worry, Min. I’ll
take care of you.”
But who was going to take care of Rand? Can I trust you, he had asked this boy who had been
one of the first to come asking to learn. Light, who would make him safe?

Rounding a corner, Rand stopped with a hand against one wall to seize the Source. A fool thing,
not wanting Min to see him stagger when someone tried to kill him, but there it was. Not just any
someone. A man, Demandred, or perhaps Asmodean come back at last. Maybe both; there had
been an oddity, as if the weaving came from different directions. He had felt the channeling too
late to do anything. He would have died, in his rooms. He was ready to die. But not Min, no, not
Min. Elayne was better off, turning against him. Oh, Light, she was!
He seized the Source, and saidin flooded him with molten cold and freezing heat, with life and
sweetness, filth and death. His stomach twisted, and the hallway in front of him doubled itself. For an
instant, he thought he saw a face. Not with his eyes; in his head. A man, shimmering and
unrecognizable, gone. He floated in the Void, empty, and full of the Power.
You won’t win, he told Lews Therin. If I die, I’ll die me!
I should have sent Ilyena away, Lews Therin whispered back. She would have lived.
Pushing the voice away as he pushed himself from the wall, Rand slipped along the Palace
corridors with all the stealth he could muster, stepping lightly, gliding close to tapestry-hung walls,
around gold-worked chests and gilded cabinets bearing fragile golden porcelains and ivory statuettes.
His eyes searched for his attackers. They would not be satisfied short of finding his body, but they
would be very careful in approaching his rooms in case he had survived by some ta’veren swirl of
fate. They would wait, to see whether he stirred. In the Void, he was as near one with the Power as
any man could live through. In the Void, as with a sword, he was one with his surroundings.
Frantic shouts and clamor rose in every direction, some screaming to know what had happened,
others crying that the Dragon Reborn had gone mad. The bundle of frustration in his head that was
Alanna provided one small comfort. She was out of the Palace, as she had been all morning, maybe
even outside the city walls. He wished Min was, too. Sometimes he saw men and women down one

hallway or another, black-liveried servants mainly, running, falling down and scrambling up to run
again. They did not see him. With the Power in him, he could hear every whisper. Including the
whisper of soft boots running, light-footed.
Backing against the wall beside a long table topped with porcelain, he quickly wove Fire and
Air around himself and held very still wrapped in Folded Light.
Maidens appeared, a stream of them, veiled, and ran by without seeing him. Toward his
apartments. He could not let them accompany him; he had promised, but to let them fight, not to lead
them to slaughter. When he found Demandred and Asmodean, all the Maidens could do was die, and
he already had five names to learn and add to his list. Somara of the Bent Peak Daryne was already
there. A promise he had had to make, a promise he had to keep. For that promise alone, he deserved
to die!
Eagles and women can only be kept safe in cages, Lews Therin said as though quoting, then
abruptly began weeping as the last of the Maidens vanished.
Rand moved on, sweeping back and forth through the palace in arcs that slowly moved away
from his apartments. Folded Light used very little of the Power—so little no man could have felt the
use of saidin unless right on top of it—and he used it whenever anyone seemed about to see him. His
attackers had not struck at his rooms on the chance he would be there. They had eyes-and-ears in the
Palace. Maybe it had been ta’veren work that pulled him out of the apartments, if a ta’veren could
work on himself, and maybe just happenstance, but perhaps his tugging at the Pattern could bring his
attackers within his grasp while they thought him dead or injured. Lews Therin chuckled at the
thought. Rand could almost feel the man rubbing his hands in anticipation.
Three more times he had to hide behind the Power as veiled Maidens rushed by, and once when
he saw Cadsuane sweeping along the corridor ahead with no fewer than six Aes Sedai at her heels,
and not one other that he recognized besides her. They seemed to be hunting. He was not afraid of the
gray-haired sister, precisely. No, of course not afraid! But he waited until she and her friends were
well out of sight before letting his concealing weave go. Lews Therin did not chuckle over Cadsuane.
He was deathly silent until she was gone.
Rand stepped away from the wall, a door opened right beside him, and Ailil peeked out. He had
not known he was near her rooms. Behind her shoulder stood a dark woman with fat golden rings in
her ears and a medallion-filled golden chain running across her left cheek to her nose ring. Shalon,
Windfinder to Harine din Togara, the Atha’an Miere ambassador who had moved into the Palace with
her retinue almost as Merana informed him of the agreement. And meeting with a woman who might
want him dead. Their eyes popped at the sight of him.
He was as gentle as he could be, but he had to be quick. A few moments after the door opened,
he was tucking a somewhat rumpled Ailil beneath her bed alongside Shalon. Perhaps they were not
part of what was happening. Perhaps. Safe was better than sorry. Glaring at him above mouths
wadded full of Ailil’s scarves, the two women writhed against the torn strips of bedsheet he had used
to bind their wrists and ankles. The shield he had tied off on Shalon would hold her for a day or two
before the knot unraveled, but someone would find them and cut their other bonds before too much
longer.
Worrying about that shield, he opened the door enough to check the hallway, and hurried out,
along the empty corridor. He could not have left the Windfinder free to channel, but shielding a
woman was not a matter of dribbles of the Power. If one of his attackers had been close enough . . .
But he saw no one down any of the crossing corridors, either.
Fifty paces beyond Ailil’s rooms, the corridor opened into a square-railed balcony of blue

marble with broad stairs at either end, fronting a square chamber with a high, vaulted ceiling and the
same sort of balcony at the other side. Tapestries ten paces long hung along the walls, birds soaring to
the skies in rigid patterns. Below, Dashiva stood looking about, licking his lips uncertainly. Gedwyn
and Rochaid were with him! Lews Therin chittered of killing.
“. . . telling you I felt nothing,” Gedwyn was saying. “He’s dead!”
And Dashiva saw Rand, at the head of the stairs.
The only warning he had was the sudden snarl that contorted Dashiva’s face. Dashiva channeled,
and with no time to think, Rand wove—as so often, he did not know what; something dredged from
Lews Therin’s memories; he was not even sure he created the weave entirely himself, or whether
Lews Therin snatched at saidin—Air and Fire and Earth woven around himself just so. The fire that
leaped from Dashiva erupted, shattering marble, flinging Rand back down the hallway, bounding and
rolling in his cocoon.
That barrier would keep out anything short of balefire. Including air to breathe. Rand released it
panting, scraping along the floor, with the crash of the explosions still ringing in the air, dust still
hanging and bits of broken marble tumbling. As much as for breath, though, he let it go because what
could keep the Power out, kept it in. Before he stopped sliding, he channeled Fire and Air, but woven
much differently than for Folded Light. Thin red wires leaped from his left hand, fanning out as they
sliced through the intervening stone toward where Dashiva and the others had been standing. From his
left sped balls of flame, Fire woven with Air, faster than he could count, and they burned through the
stone before exploding in that chamber. One continuous deafening roar made the Palace tremble. Dust
that had fallen rose up again, and pieces of stone bounced.
Almost immediately, though, he was up and running, back past Ailil’s apartments. The man who
struck and stayed in one spot was asking to die. He was ready to die, but not yet. Snarling
soundlessly, he sped down another hall, descended narrow servants’ stairs, and came out on the floor
below.
He took care making his way back to where he had seen Dashiva, deadly weaves ready to fling
at so much as a glimpse.
I should have killed them all in the beginning, Lews Therin panted. I should have killed them
all!
Rand let him rage.
The large chamber seemed to have been washed in fire. Only charred fragments licked by flames
remained of the tapestries, and great gouges a pace across had been burned into floor and walls. The
stairs Rand had been about to descend ended in a ten-foot gap halfway down. Of the three men, there
was no sign. They would not have been consumed completely. Something would have remained.
A servant in a black coat cautiously poked his head from a tiny door beside the stairs on the
other side of the chamber. His eyes fell on Rand, rolled up in his head, and he fell forward in a heap.
Another servant peeped out of a corridor, then gathered her skirts and raced back the way she had
come, shrieking at the top of her lungs that the Dragon Reborn was killing everyone in the Palace.
Rand slipped out of the chamber grimacing. He was very good at frightening people who could
not harm him. Very good at destroying.
To destroy, or be destroyed , Lews Therin laughed. When that’s your choice, is there a
difference?
Somewhere in the Palace, a man channeled enough of the Power to make a gateway. Dashiva and
the others fleeing? Or wanting him to think that?
He walked the corridors of the Palace, no longer bothering to hide. Everyone else seemed to be.

The few servants he saw, fled screaming. Corridor after corridor, he hunted, filled near to bursting
with saidin, full of fire and ice trying to annihilate him as surely as Dashiva had, full of the taint
worming its way into his soul. He had no need of Lews Therin’s ragged laughter and ravings to be
filled with a desire to kill.
A glimpse of a black coat ahead, and his hand shot up, fire streaking, exploding, tearing away the
corner where the two hallways met. Rand let the weave subside, but did not let it go. Had he killed
him?
“My Lord Dragon,” a voice shouted from beyond the torn stonework, “it’s me, Narishma! And
Flinn!”
“I didn’t recognize you,” Rand lied. “Come here.”
“I think maybe your blood’s hot,” Flinn’s voice called. “I think maybe we should wait for
everybody to cool down.”
“Yes,” Rand said slowly. Had he really tried to kill Narishma? He did not think he could claim
the excuse of Lews Therin. “Yes, that might be best. For a little while longer.” There was no answer.
Did he hear boots retreating? He forced his hands down and turned another way.
He searched through the Palace for hours without finding a sign of Dashiva or the others. The
corridors and great halls, even the kitchens, were empty of people. He found nothing, and learned
nothing. No. He realized that he had learned one thing. Trust was a knife, and the hilt was as sharp as
the blade.
Then he found pain.
The small stone-walled room was deep below the Sun Palace and warm despite the lack of a
fireplace, but Min felt cold. Three gilded lamps on the tiny wooden table gave more than enough light.
Rand had said that from there, he could get her away even if someone tried to root the Palace out of
the ground. He had not sounded as if he were joking.
Holding the crown of Illian on her lap, she watched Rand. Watched Rand watching Fedwin. Her
hands tightened on the crown, and loosened immediately at the stabs of those small swords hidden
among the laurel leaves. Strange, that the crown and scepter should have survived when the Dragon
Throne itself was a pile of gilded splinters buried in rubble. A large leather scrip beside her chair,
with Rand’s sword belt and scabbarded sword resting against it, held what else he had been able to
salvage. Strange choices for the most part, in her estimation.
You brainless loobie, she thought. Not thinking about what’s right in front of you won’t make
it go away.
Rand sat cross-legged on the bare stone floor, still covered in dust and scratches, his coat torn.
His face might have been carved. He seemed to watch Fedwin without blinking. The boy was sitting
on the floor, too, his legs sprawled out. Tongue caught between his teeth, Fedwin was concentrating
on making a tower out of blocks of wood. Min swallowed hard.
She could still remember the horror when she realized the boy “guarding” her now had the mind
of a small child. The sadness remained, too—Light, he was only a boy! it was not right!—but she
hoped Rand still had him shielded. It had not been easy, talking Fedwin into playing with those
wooden blocks instead of pulling stones out of the walls with the Power to make a “big tower to keep
you safe in.” And then she had sat guarding him until Rand came. Oh, Light, she wanted to cry. For
Rand even more than Fedwin.
“You hide yourself in the depths, it appears.”
The deep voice was not finished speaking from the doorway before Rand was on his feet, facing
Mazrim Taim. As usual, the hook-nosed man wore a black coat with blue-and-gold Dragons spiraling

up the arms. Unlike the other Asha’man, he had neither Sword nor Dragon on his high collar. His dark
face wore nearly as little expression as Rand’s. Now, staring at Taim, Rand seemed to be gritting his
teeth. Min surreptitiously eased a knife in her coatsleeve. As many images and auras danced around
one as the other, but it was not a viewing that made her suddenly wary. She had seen a man trying to
decide whether to kill another before, and she was seeing it again.
“You come here holding saidin, Taim?” Rand said, much too softly. Taim spread his hands, and
Rand said, “That’s better.” But he did not relax.
“It was just that I thought I might be stabbed by accident,” Taim said, “making my way here
through corridors packed with those Aiel women. They seem agitated.” His eyes never left Rand, but
Min was sure he had noticed her touching her knife. “Understandably, of course,” he went on
smoothly. “I cannot express my joy at finding you alive after seeing what I did above. I came to report
deserters. Normally, I wouldn’t have bothered, but these are Gedwyn, Rochaid, Torval, and Kisman.
It seems they were malcontented over events in Altara, but I never thought they would go this far. I
haven’t seen any of the men I left with you.” For an instant, his gaze flickered to Fedwin. For no more
than an instant. “There were . . . other . . . casualties? I will take this one with me, if you wish.”
“I told them to stay out of sight,” Rand said in a harsh voice. “And I’ll take care of Fedwin.
Fedwin Morr, Taim; not ‘this one.’ ” He actually backed to the small table to pick up the silver cup
sitting among the lamps. Min’s breath caught.
“The Wisdom in my village could cure anything,” Rand said as he knelt beside Fedwin.
Somehow, he managed to smile at the boy without taking his eyes from Taim. Fedwin smiled back
happily and tried to take the cup, but Rand held it for him to drink. “She knows more about herbs than
anybody I’ve ever met. I learned a little from her, which are safe, which not.” Fedwin sighed as Rand
took the cup away and held the boy to his chest. “Sleep, Fedwin,” Rand murmured.
It did seem that the boy was going to sleep. His eyes closed. His chest rose and fell more
slowly. Slower. Until it stopped. The smile never left his lips.
“A little something in the wine,” Rand said softly as he laid Fedwin down. Min’s eyes burned,
but she would not cry. She would not!
“You are harder than I thought,” Taim muttered.
Rand smiled at him, a hard feral smile. “Add Corlan Dashiva to your list of deserters, Taim.
Next time I visit the Black Tower, I expect to see his head on your Traitor’s Tree.”
“Dashiva?” Taim snarled, his eyes widening in surprise. “It will be as you say. When next you
visit the Black Tower.” That quickly, he recovered himself, all polished stone and poise once more.
How she wished she could read her viewings of him.
“Return to the Black Tower, and don’t come here again.” Standing, Rand faced the other man
over Fedwin’s body. “I may be moving about for a while.”
Taim’s bow was minuscule. “As you command.”
As the door closed behind him, Min let out a long breath.
“No point wasting time, and no time to waste,” Rand muttered. Kneeling in front of her, he took
the crown and slipped it into the scrip with the other things. “Min, I thought I was the whole pack of
hounds, chasing down one wolf after another, but it seems I’m the wolf.”
“Burn you,” she breathed. Tangling both hands in his hair, she stared in his eyes. Now blue, now
gray, a morning sky just at sunrise. And dry. “You can cry, Rand al’Thor. You won’t melt if you cry!”
“I don’t have time for tears, either, Min,” he said gently. “Sometimes, the hounds catch the wolf
and wish they hadn’t. Sometimes, he turns on them, or waits in ambush. But first, the wolf has to run.”
“When do we go?” she asked. She did not let go of his hair. She was never going to let go of

him. Never.

CHAPTER
30

Beginnings

H olding his fur-lined cloak close with one hand, Perrin let Stayer walk at the bay’s own
pace. The midmorning sun gave no warmth, and the rutted snow on the road leading into Abila
made poor footing. He and his dozen companions shared the way with only two lumbering oxcarts and a handful of farm-folk in plain dark woolens. They all trudged along with heads down,
clutching at hat or cap whenever a gust rose but otherwise concentrating on the ground beneath
their shoes.
Behind him, he heard Neald make a ribald joke in a low voice; Grady grunted in reply, and
Balwer sniffed prissily. None of the three seemed at all affected by what they had seen and heard this
past month since crossing the border into Amadicia, or by what lay ahead. Edarra was sharply
berating Masuri for letting her hood slip. Edarra and Carelle both wore their shawls wrapped around
their heads and shoulders in addition to cloaks, but even after admitting the necessity to ride, they had
refused to change out of their bulky skirts, so their dark-stockinged legs were bared above the knee.
The cold did not seem to bother them in the least; just the strangeness of snow. Carelle began quietly
advising Seonid as to what would happen if she did not keep her face hidden.
Of course, if she let her face be seen too soon, a dose of the strap would be the least she had to
fear, as she and the Wise One knew well. Perrin did not have to look back to know the sisters’ three
Warders, bringing up the rear in ordinary cloaks, were men expecting the need at any moment to out
sword and carve a way clear. They had been that way since leaving the camp at dawn. He ran a
gloved thumb along the axe hanging at his belt, then regathered his own cloak just before a sudden
gust could make it billow. If this went badly, the Warders might be right.
Off to the left, short of where the road crossed a wooden bridge over a frozen stream that
twisted along the town’s edge, charred timbers thrust out of the snow atop a large square stone
platform with drifts piled around the bottom. Slow to proclaim allegiance to the Dragon Reborn, the
local lord had been lucky merely to be flogged and fined all that he possessed. A knot of men standing
at the bridge watched the mounted party approaching. Perrin saw no sign of helmets or armor, but
every man clutched spear or crossbow almost as hard as he did his cloak. They did not talk to one
another. They just watched, the mist of their breath curling before their faces. There were other
guards bunched all around the town, at every road leading out, at every space between two buildings.

This was the Prophet’s country, but the Whitecloaks and King Ailron’s army still held large parts of
it.
“I was right not to bring her,” he muttered, “but I’ll pay for it anyway.”
“Of course you’ll pay,” Elyas snorted. For a man who had spent most of the last fifteen years
afoot, he handled his mouse-colored gelding well. He had acquired a cloak lined with black fox,
dicing with Gallenne. Aram, riding on Perrin’s other side, eyed Elyas darkly, but the bearded man
ignored him. They did not get on well. “A man always pays sooner or later, with any woman, whether
he owes or not. But I was right, wasn’t I?”
Perrin nodded. Grudgingly. It still did not seem right taking advice about his wife from another
man, even circumspectly, obliquely, yet it did seem to be working. Of course, raising his voice to
Faile was as hard as not raising it to Berelain, but he had managed the last quite often and the first
several times. He had followed Elyas’ advice to the letter. Well, most of it. As well as he could. That
spiky scent of jealousy still flared at the sight of Berelain, yet on the other hand, the hurt smell had
vanished as they made their slow way south. Still, he was uneasy. When he firmly told her she was
not coming with him this morning, she had not raised a single word of protest! She even smelled . . .
pleased! Among other things, including startled. And how could she be pleased and angry at the same
time? Not a scrap of it had showed on her face, but his nose never lied. Somehow, it seemed that the
more he learned about women, the less he knew!
The bridge guards frowned and fingered their weapons as Stayer’s hooves thudded hollowly
onto the wooden planking. They were the usual odd mix that followed the Prophet, dirty-faced
fellows in silk coats too big for them, scar-faced street toughs and pink-cheeked apprentices, former
merchants and craftsmen who looked as if they had slept in their once fine woolens for months. Their
weapons appeared well cared for, though. Some of the men had a fever in their eyes; the rest wore
guarded, wooden faces. Along with unwashed, they smelled eager, anxious, fervent, afraid, all
jumbled together.
They made no move to bar passage, just watched, hardly blinking. By what Perrin had heard, all
sorts from ladies in silks to beggars in rags came to the Prophet hoping that submitting to him in
person might gain added blessings. Or maybe added protection. That was why he had come this way,
with only a handful of companions. He would frighten Masema if he had to, if Masema could be
frightened, but it had seemed better to try reaching the man without fighting a battle. He could feel the
guard’s eyes on his back until he and the others were all across the short bridge and onto the paved
streets of Abila. When that pressure left, though, it brought no sense of relief.
Abila was a goodly sized town, with several tall watchtowers and many buildings rising four
stories, every last one roofed in slate. Here and there, mounded stone and timbers filled a gap
between two structures where an inn or some merchant’s house had been pulled down. The Prophet
disapproved of wealth gained by trade as much as he did carousing or what his followers called lewd
behavior. He disapproved of a great many things, and made his feelings known with sharp examples.
The streets were jammed with people, but Perrin and his companions were the only ones on
horseback. The snow had long since been trampled to half-frozen ankle-deep mush. Plenty of ox-carts
made their slow way through the throng, but very few wagons, and not a single carriage. Except for
those wearing worn castoffs or possibly stolen clothes, everyone wore drab woolens. Most people
hurried, but like the folk on the road, with heads down. Those who did not hurry were straggling
groups of men carrying weapons. In the streets, the smell was mainly dirt and fear. It made Perrin’s
hackles rise. At least, if it came to that, getting out of a town with no wall would not prove harder
than getting in.

“My Lord,” Balwer murmured as they came abreast of one of those heaps of rubble. He barely
waited for Perrin’s nod before turning his hammer-nosed mount aside and making his way in another
direction, hunched in his saddle with his brown cloak held tight around him. Perrin had no worries
about the dried-up little man going off alone, even here. For a secretary, he managed to learn a
surprising amount on these forays of his. He seemed to know what he was about.
Dismissing Balwer from his thoughts, Perrin set to what he was there about.
It took only one question, put to a lanky young man with an ecstatic light on his face, to learn
where the Prophet was staying, and three more to other folk in the streets to find the merchant’s house,
four stories of gray stone with white marble moldings and window frames. Masema disapproved of
grubbing for money, but he was willing to accept accommodations from those who did. On the other
hand, Balwer said he had slept in a leaky farmhouse as often and been as satisfied. Masema drank
only water, and wherever he went, he hired a poor widow and ate the food she prepared, fair or foul,
without complaint. The man had made too many widows for that charity to count far with Perrin.
The throng that packed the streets elsewhere was absent in front of the tall house, yet the number
of armed guards like those at the bridge almost made up for it. They stared at Perrin sullenly, those
who did not sneer insolently. The two Aes Sedai kept their faces hidden in their deep hoods and their
heads down, white breath rising from the cowls like steam. From the corner of his eye, Perrin saw
Elyas thumbing the hilt of his long knife. It was hard not to stroke his axe.
“I’ve come with a message for the Prophet from the Dragon Reborn,” he announced. When none
of the men moved, he added, “My name is Perrin Aybara. The Prophet knows me.” Balwer had
cautioned him about the dangers of using Masema’s name, or calling Rand anything but the Lord
Dragon Reborn. He was not there to start a riot.
The claim of knowing Masema seemed to put a spark into the guards. Several exchanged wideeyed looks, and one went running inside. The rest stared at him as if he were a gleeman. In a few
moments, a woman came to the door. Handsome, with white at her temples, in a high-necked dress of
blue wool that was fine if unadorned, she might have been the merchant herself. Masema did not
throw those who offered him hospitality into the streets, but their servants or farmhands usually ended
up with one of the bands “spreading the glories of the Lord Dragon.”
“If you will come with me, Master Aybara,” the woman said calmly, “you and your friends, I
will take you to the Prophet of the Lord Dragon, may the Light illumine his name.” Calm she might
sound, but terror filled her scent.
Telling Neald and the Warders to watch the horses until they returned, Perrin followed her
inside with the others. The interior was dark, with few lamps lit, and not much warmer than outside.
Even the Wise Ones seemed subdued. They did not smell afraid, but almost as close to it as the Aes
Sedai, and Grady and Elyas smelled of wariness, of raised hackles and ears laid back. Strangely,
Aram’s scent was eager. Perrin hoped the man did not try to draw that sword on his back.
The large, carpeted room the woman led them to, with fires blazing on hearths at either end,
might have been a general’s study, every table and half the chairs covered with maps and papers, and
warm enough that Perrin tossed his cloak back and regretted wearing two shirts under his coat. But it
was Masema standing in the middle of the room who drew his eyes immediately, like iron filings to a
lodestone, a dark, scowling man with a shaven head and a pale triangular scar on one cheek, in a
wrinkled gray coat and scuffed boots. His deep-set eyes burned with a black fire, and his scent . . .
The only name Perrin could give that smell, steel-hard and blade-sharp and quivering with wild
intensity, was madness. And Rand thought he could put a leash on this?
“So, it is you,” Masema growled. “I did not think you would dare show your face. I know what

you’ve been up to! Hari told me more than a week ago, and I have kept myself informed.” A man
shifted in a corner of the room, a narrow-eyed fellow with a thrusting nose, and Perrin upbraided
himself for not noticing him before. Hari’s green silk coat was much finer than what he had worn
when he denied collecting ears. The fellow rubbed his hands together and grinned at Perrin viciously,
but he kept silent as Masema went on. The Prophet’s voice grew hotter by the word, not with anger,
but as though he meant to burn every syllable deep into Perrin’s flesh. “I know about you murdering
men who have come to the Lord Dragon. I know about you trying to carve out your own kingdom!
Yes, I know about Manetheren! About your ambition! Your greed for glory! You have turned your
back on—!”
Suddenly Masema’s eyes bulged, and for the first time, anger flamed in his scent. Hari made a
strangled sound and tried to back through the wall. Seonid and Masuri had lowered their hoods and
stood with bare faces, calm and cool, and plainly Aes Sedai to anyone who knew the look. Perrin
wondered whether they held the Power. He would have wagered that the Wise Ones did. Edarra and
Carelle were quietly watching every direction at once, and smooth faces or no, if he had ever seen
anyone ready to fight, it was them. For that matter, Grady wore readiness like his black coat; maybe
he held the Power, too. Elyas was leaning against the wall beside the open doors, outwardly as
composed as the sisters, but he smelled ready to bite. And Aram stood gazing at Masema with his
mouth hanging open! Light!
“So that is true, too!” Masema snapped, spittle flying from his lips. “With filthy rumors
spreading against the holy name of the Lord Dragon, you dare to ride with these . . . these . . . !”
“They’ve sworn fealty to the Lord Dragon, Masema,” Perrin cut in. “They serve him! Do you?
He sent me to stop the killing. And to bring you to him.” No one was offering him a chair, so he
pushed a stack of papers from one and sat. He wished the rest would sit, too; shouting seemed harder
when you were sitting down.
Hari goggled at him, and Masema was practically shaking. Because he had taken a chair without
being asked? Oh. Yes.
“I have given up the names of men,” Masema said coldly. “I am simply the Prophet of the Lord
Dragon, may the Light illumine him and the world come to kneel before him.” By his tone, the world
and the Light would regret failure equally. “There is much to do here, yet Great works. All must obey
when the Lord Dragon calls, but in winter, travel is always slow. A delay of a few weeks will make
little difference.”
“I can have you in Cairhien today,” Perrin said. “Once the Lord Dragon has spoken to you, you
can return the same way and be back here in a few days.” If Rand let him return.
Masema actually recoiled. Baring his teeth, he glared at the Aes Sedai. “Some contrivance of the
Power? I will not be touched with the Power! It is blasphemy for mortals to touch it!”
Perrin came close to gaping. “The Dragon Reborn channels, man!”
“The blessed Lord Dragon is not as other men, Aybara!” Masema snarled. “He is the Light made
flesh! I will obey his summons, but I will not be touched by the filth these women do!”
Slumping back in the chair, Perrin sighed. If the man was this bad over Aes Sedai, how would
he be when he learned that Grady and Neald could channel? For a moment, he considered simply
knocking Masema over the head, and . . . Men were passing by in the corridor, pausing to glance in
before hurrying on. All it took was one of them raising a shout, and Abila could become a
slaughterhouse. “Then we ride, Prophet,” he said sourly. Light, Rand had said to keep this secret until
Masema stood in front of him! How to manage that riding all the way to Cairhien? “But no delays.
The Lord Dragon is very anxious to talk with you.”

“I am anxious to speak with the Lord Dragon, may his name be blessed by the Light.” His eyes
flickered toward the two Aes Sedai. He tried to hide it, actually smiling at Perrin. But he smelled . . .
grim. “I am very anxious indeed.”
“Would my Lady like me to ask one of the handlers to bring her a hawk?” Maighdin asked. One
of Alliandre’s four hawk handlers, all men as lean as their birds, urged a sleek duckhawk wearing a
feathered hood onto his heavy gauntlet from the wooden stand in front of his saddle and lifted the gray
bird toward her. The falcon, with its blue-tipped wings, was on Alliandre’s green-gloved wrist. That
bird was reserved to her, unfortunately. Alliandre knew her place as a vassal, but Faile understood
not wanting to relinquish a favorite bird.
She merely shook her head, and Maighdin bowed in her saddle and moved her roan mare away
from Swallow, far enough not to intrude but close enough to be at hand without Faile raising her
voice. The dignified golden-haired woman had proved to be every bit as good a lady’s maid as Faile
had hoped, knowledgeable, capable. At least, she had once she learned that whatever their relative
positions with their former mistress, Lini was first among Faile’s serving women, and willing to use
her authority. Surprisingly, that had actually taken an episode with a switch, but Faile pretended not to
know. Only an utter fool embarrassed her servants. There was still the matter of Maighdin and
Tallanvor, of course. She was certain Maighdin had begun sharing his bed, and if she found proof,
they would marry if she had to turn Lini loose on both of them. Still, that was a small matter, and
could not spoil her morning.
Hawking had been Alliandre’s idea, but Faile had not objected to a ride through this sparse
forest, where snow made a rolling blanket over everything and lay thick and white on bare branches.
The green of the trees that still held their leaves seemed sharper. The air was crisp, and it smelled
new and fresh.
Bain and Chiad had insisted on accompanying her, but they squatted nearby, shoufa wrapped
around their heads, watching her with disgruntled expressions. Sulin had wanted to come with all of
the Maidens, but with a hundred stories of Aiel depredations floating everywhere, the sight of an Aiel
was enough to send most people in Amadicia running or reaching for a sword. There must be some
truth in those tales, or so many would not know an Aiel, though the Light alone knew who they were
or where they had come from, yet even Sulin agreed that whoever they were, they had moved on east,
perhaps into Altara.
In any case, this close to Abila, twenty of Alliandre’s soldiers and as many Mayener Winged
Guards provided sufficient escort. The streamers on their lances, red or green, lifted like ribbons
when the breeze stirred. Berelain’s presence was the only blight. Though watching the woman shiver
in her fur-trimmed red cloak, thick enough for two blankets, was certainly amusing. Mayene did not
have a real winter. This was like the last days of autumn. In Saldaea, the heart of winter could freeze
exposed flesh hard as wood. Faile took a deep breath. She felt like laughing.
By some miracle, her husband, her beloved wolf, had begun behaving as he should. Instead of
shouting at Berelain or running from her, Perrin now tolerated the jade’s blandishments, plainly
tolerated them the way he would a child playing around his knees. And best of all, there was no
longer any need to tamp down her anger when she wanted to let it loose. When she shouted, he
shouted back. She knew he was not Saldaean, but it had been so hard, thinking in her heart of hearts
that he believed her too weak to stand up to him. A few nights ago at supper, she had almost pointed
out to him that Berelain was going to fall out of her dress if she leaned over the table any farther.
Well, she was not going to go that far, not with Berelain; the trull still thought she could win him. And
that very morning, he had been commanding, quietly brooking no argument, the sort of man a woman

knew she had to be strong to deserve, to equal. Of course, she would have to nip him over that. A
commanding man was wonderful, so long as he did not come to believe he could always command.
Laugh? She could have sung!
“Maighdin, I think after all I will . . .” Maighdin was there immediately with an enquiring smile,
but Faile trailed off at the sight of three riders ahead of her, plowing through the snow as fast as they
could push their horses.
“At least there are plenty of hares, my Lady,” Alliandre said, walking her tall white gelding up
beside Swallow, “but I had hoped . . . Who are they?” Her falcon shifted on her thick glove, the bells
on its jesses jingling. “Why, it looks like some of your people, my Lady.”
Faile nodded grimly. She recognized them, too. Parelean, Arrela and Lacile. But what were they
doing here?
The three drew rein before her, their horses panting steam. Parelean looked as wide-eyed as his
dapple. Lacile, her pale face nearly hidden in the deep cowl of her cloak, was swallowing anxiously,
and Arrela’s dark face seemed gray. “My Lady,” Parelean said urgently, “dire news! The Prophet
Masema has been meeting with the Seanchan!”
“The Seanchan!” Alliandre exclaimed. “Surely he cannot believe they will come to the Lord
Dragon!”
“It might be simpler,” Berelain said, heeling her too-showy white mare up on Alliandre’s other
side. Without Perrin about for her to try to impress, her dark blue riding dress was cut quite modestly,
with a neck up under her chin. She still shivered. “Masema dislikes Aes Sedai, and the Seanchan
keep women who can channel as prisoners.”
Faile clicked her tongue in vexation. Dire news indeed, if true. And she could only hope
Parelean and the others retained enough of their wits to at least pretend they had simply overheard
talk by chance. Even so, she had to be sure, and quickly. Perrin might already have reached Masema.
“What proof do you have, Parelean?”
“We talked to three farmers who saw a large flying creature land four nights ago, my Lady. It
brought a woman who was taken to Masema and remained with him for three hours.”
“We were able to trace her all the way to where Masema stays in Abila,” Lacile added.
“The three men all thought the creature was Shadowspawn,” Arrela put in, “but they seemed
fairly reliable.” For her to say any man not of Cha Faile was fairly reliable was the same as anyone
else saying they thought he was honest as a bell.
“I think I must ride into Abila,” Faile said, gathering Swallow’s reins. “Alliandre, take
Maighdin and Berelain with you.” Any other time, the tightening of Berelain’s lips over that would
have been amusing. “Parelean, Arrela and Lacile will accompany me—” A man screamed, and
everyone jerked.
Fifty paces away, one of Alliandre’s green-coated soldiers was toppling from his saddle, and a
moment later, a Winged Guard fell with an arrow standing out from his throat. Aiel appeared among
the trees, veiled and wielding bows as they ran. More soldiers fell. Bain and Chiad were on their
feet, dark veils hiding their faces to the eyes; their spears were thrust through the straps of the bow
cases on their back, and they worked their bows smoothly, but they cast glances toward Faile, too.
There were Aiel all around, hundreds it seemed, a great noose closing in. Mounted soldiers lowered
lances, pulling back in their own circle around Faile and the others, but gaps appeared immediately
as Aiel arrows struck home.
“Someone must get this news of Masema to Lord Perrin,” Faile told Parelean and the two
women. “One of you must reach him! Ride like fire!” Her sweeping gaze took in Alliandre and

Maighdin. And Berelain, too. “All of you, ride like fire, or die here!” Barely waiting for their nods,
she suited actions to words, and dug her heels into Swallow’s flanks, bursting through the useless ring
of soldiers. “Ride!” she shouted. Someone had to get the news to Perrin. “Ride!”
Leaning low on Swallow’s neck, she urged the black mare for speed. Fleet hooves splashed
snow as Swallow ran, light as her namesake. For a hundred strides, Faile thought she might break
free. And then Swallow screamed and stumbled, pitching forward with the sharp snap of a breaking
leg. Faile flew through air and struck hard, most of the breath driven out of her as she plunged
facedown into the snow. Fighting for air, she struggled to her feet and snatched a knife from her belt.
Swallow had screamed before she stumbled, before that awful crack.
A veiled Aielman loomed up before her as if out of the air, chopping at her wrist with a stiffened
hand. Her knife dropped from suddenly numb fingers, and before she could try to draw another with
her left hand, the man was on her.
She fought, kicking, punching, even biting, but the fellow was as wide as Perrin and a head
taller. He seemed as hard as Perrin, too, for all the impression she made on him. She could have wept
with frustration at the humiliating ease with which he handled her, first rooting out all of her knives
and tucking them behind his belt, then using one of her own blades to cut her clothes away. Almost
before she knew it, she was naked in the snow, her elbows bound together behind her back with one
of her stockings, the other tied about her neck for a leash.
She had no choice except to follow him, shivering and stumbling through the snow. Her skin
pebbled with the cold. Light, how she had ever thought this day anything less than icy? Light, if only
someone had managed to escape with the news of Masema! To carry word of her capture to Perrin, of
course, but she could escape somehow. The other was more important.
The first body she saw was Parelean, sprawled on his back with his sword in one outflung hand
and blood all over his fine coat with the satin-striped sleeves. There were plenty of corpses after,
Winged Guards in their red breastplates, Alliandre’s soldiers in their dark green helmets, one of the
hawkers, the hooded duckhawk flapping vainly against the jesses still gripped in the dead man’s fist.
She held on to hope, though.
The first other prisoners she saw, kneeling among some Aiel, men and Maidens with their veils
hanging down their chests, were Bain and Chiad, each naked, unbound hands on her knees. Blood ran
down across Bain’s face and matted her flame-red hair. Chiad’s left cheek was purple and swollen,
and her gray eyes looked slightly glazed. They knelt there, straight-backed, impassive, and
unashamed, but as the big Aielman pushed her roughly to her knees beside them, they roused
themselves.
“This is not right, Shaido,” Chiad mumbled angrily.
“She does not follow ji’e’toh,” Bain barked. “You cannot make her gai’shain.”
“The gai’shain will be quiet,” a graying Maiden said absently. Bain and Chiad gave Faile
regretful looks, then settled back to their calm waiting. Huddling, trying to hide her nakedness against
her knees, Faile did not know whether to weep or laugh. The two women she would have chosen to
help her escape from anywhere, and neither would raise a hand to try because of ji’e’toh.
“I say again, Efalin,” the man who had captured her muttered, “this is foolishness. We travel at a
crawl in this . . . snow.” He said the word awkwardly. “There are too many armed men, here. We
should be moving east, not taking more gai’shain to slow us further.”
“Sevanna wants more gai’shain, Rolan,” the graying Maiden replied. She frowned, though, and
her hard gray eyes seemed disapproving for a moment.
Shivering, Faile blinked as the names sank in. Light, but the cold was making her wits slow.

Sevanna. Shaido. They were in Kinslayer’s Dagger, as far from here as was possible to be without
crossing the Spine of the World! Clearly they were not, though. That was something Perrin should
know, another reason for her to escape soon. There seemed little chance of that, crouching there in the
snow and wondering which bits of her were going to freeze first. The Wheel was balancing her
amusement over Berelain’s shivers with a vengeance. She was actually looking forward to the thick
woolen robes that gai’shain wore. Her captors made no move to depart, though. There were other
captives to be brought in.
First was Maighdin, stripped bare and bound as Faile was, and struggling every step of the way.
Until the Maiden who was pushing her along abruptly kicked her feet out from under her. Maighdin
plunked down sitting in the snow, and her eyes popped so wide that Faile might have laughed if she
had not felt sorry for the woman. Alliandre came next, bent nearly double in an effort to shield
herself, and then Arrela, who seemed half paralyzed by her nudity and was almost being dragged by a
pair of Maidens. Finally, another tall Aielman appeared with a furiously kicking Lacile tucked under
one arm like a package.
“The rest are dead or escaped,” the man said, dropping the small Cairhienin woman beside
Faile. “Sevanna will have to be satisfied, Efalin. She puts too much store in taking people who wear
silk.”
Faile did not struggle at all when she was prodded to her feet and set to laboring through the
snow at the head of the other prisoners. She was too stunned to fight. Parelean dead, Arrela and
Lacile captive, and Alliandre, and Maighdin. Light, someone had to warn Perrin about Masema.
Someone. It seemed a final blow. Here she was, shivering and gritting her teeth to keep them from
chattering, trying her best to pretend that she was not stark naked and bound, on her way to an
uncertain captivity. All of that, and she had to hope that that slinking cat—that pouting trull!—
Berelain, had managed to escape so she could reach Perrin. Alongside everything else, that seemed
the worst of all.
Egwene walked Daishar along the column of initiates, sisters on their horses among the wagons,
Accepted and novices afoot despite the snow. The sun was bright in a sky with few clouds, but mist
curled from her gelding’s nostrils. Sheriam and Siuan rode at her back, talking quietly about
information learned from Siuan’s eyes-and-ears. Egwene had thought the fire-haired woman an
efficient Keeper once she learned that she was not the Amyrlin, but day by day, Sheriam seemed to
grow ever more assiduous about her duties. Chesa followed on her tubby mare in case the Amyrlin
wanted anything, and unlike her, she was muttering again about Meri and Selame both running away,
the ungrateful wretches, leaving her to do the work of three. They rode slowly, and Egwene very
carefully did not look toward the column.
A month of recruiting, a month of the novice book being open to all, had brought in startling
numbers, a flood anxious to become Aes Sedai, women of every age some from hundreds of miles
away. There were now twice as many novices with the column as before. Almost a thousand! Most by
far would never wear the shawl, yet the number of them had everyone staring. Some might cause
minor problems, and one, a grandmother named Sharina with a potential above even that of Nynaeve,
certainly had everyone startled, but it was not the sight of a mother and daughter squabbling because
the daughter would be the stronger by far one day that she was trying to avoid, or noblewomen who
were beginning to think they had made the wrong choice asking to be tested, or even Sharina’s
disturbingly direct looks. The gray-haired woman obeyed every rule and showed every proper
respect, but she had run her large family by the sheer force of her presence, and even some of the
sisters stepped warily around her. What Egwene did not want to see were the young women who had

joined them two days before. The two sisters who brought them had been more than startled to find
Egwene as Amyrlin, but their charges could not believe it, not Egwene al’Vere, the Mayor’s daughter
from Emond’s Field. She did not want to order anyone else punished, but she would have to if she
saw another stick her tongue out at her.
Gareth Bryne had his army in a wide column, too, cavalry and foot all arrayed and stretching out
of sight through the trees. The pale sun glinted off breastplates and helmets and the points of pikes.
Horses stamped their hooves in the snow impatiently.
Bryne walked his sturdy bay to meet her before she reached the Sitters waiting on their horses,
in a large clearing ahead of both columns. He smiled at her through the face-bars of his helmet. A
reassuring smile, she thought. “A fine morning for it, Mother,” he said. “Here.”
She only nodded, and he fell in behind her, beside Siuan. Who did not immediately begin spitting
at him. Egwene was not certain exactly what accommodation Siuan had reached with the man, but she
seldom grumbled about him anymore in Egwene’s hearing, and never when he was present. Egwene
was glad he was there, now. The Amyrlin Seat could not let her general know she wanted his
reassurance, but she felt the need of it this morning.
The Sitters had their horses in a line at the edge of the trees, and thirteen more sisters sat their
mounts a little way off, watching the Sitters carefully. Romanda and Lelaine spurred their animals
forward almost together, and Egwene could hardly help sighing as they approached, cloaks flaring
behind them, hooves spraying snow as if at the charge. The Hall obeyed her because it had no choice.
In matters concerning the war against Elaida, they did, but Light, how they could quibble over what
did or did not concern the war. When it did not, getting anything out of them was like pulling duck’s
teeth! Except for Sharina, they might have found a way to put a stop to accepting women of any age.
Even Romanda was impressed by Sharina.
The pair reined in before her, but before they could open their mouths, she spoke. “It’s time we
got on with it, daughters, and no time for wasting in idle chatter. Proceed.” Romanda sniffed, though
softly, and Lelaine looked as though she wanted to.
They wheeled their horses as one, then glared at one another a moment. Events this past month
had only heightened their dislike for each other. Lelaine tossed her head angrily in concession, and
Romanda smiled, a faint curving of her lips. Egwene almost smiled, too. That mutual animosity was
still her greatest strength in the Hall.
“The Amyrlin Seat commands you to proceed,” Romanda announced, raising one hand grandly.
The light of saidar sprang up around the thirteen sisters near the Sitters, around all of them
together, and a thick slash of silver appeared in the middle of the clearing, rotating into a gateway ten
paces tall and a hundred wide. Falling snow drifted through from the other side. Shouted orders rose
among the soldiers, and the first armored heavy calvary rode through. The swirling snow beyond the
gateway was too thick to see far, yet Egwene imagined that she could make out the Shining Walls of
Tar Valon, and the White Tower itself.
“It has begun, Mother,” Sheriam said, sounding almost surprised.
“It has begun,” Egwene agreed. And the Light willing, soon Elaida would fall. She was
supposed to wait until Bryne said sufficient of his soldiers were through, but she could not stop
herself. Digging her heels into Daishar’s flanks, she rode through into the falling snow, onto the plain
where Dragon-mount reared black and smoking against a white sky.

CHAPTER
31

After

W inter winds and winter snows slowed the passage of trade across lands where they did not
end it until spring, and for every three pigeons sent by merchants, two fell to hawks or weather,
but where ice did not cover the rivers, ships still sailed, and rumor flew faster than lightnings. A
thousand rumors, each throwing off a thousand seeds that sprouted and grew in snow and ice as
in fertile soil.
At Tar Valon, some stories said, great armies had clashed, and the streets ran with blood, and
rebel Aes Sedai had stuck the head of Elaida a’Roihan on a pike. No; Elaida had closed her hand, and
those who survived among the rebels groveled at Elaida’s feet. There had been no rebels, no division
of the White Tower. It was the Black Tower that had been broken, by Aes Sedai designs and Aes
Sedai power, and Asha’man hunted Asha’man across the nations. The White Tower had shattered the
Sun Palace in Cairhien, and the Dragon Reborn himself was bound now to the Amyrlin Seat, her
puppet and her tool. Some tales said Aes Sedai had been bound to him, bound to the Asha’man, yet
few believed that, and those few were ridiculed.
Artur Hawkwing’s armies had returned to reclaim his long-dead empire, and the Seanchan were
sweeping all before them, even to driving the Dragon Reborn from Altara in defeat. The Seanchan
had come to serve him. No; he had cast the Seanchan into the sea, destroying their army utterly. They
had carried the Dragon Reborn away, to kneel before their Empress. The Dragon Reborn was dead,
and there was as much celebration as mourning, as many tears as cries of joy.
Across the nations the stories spread like spiderweb laid upon spiderweb, and men and women
planned the future, believing they knew truth. They planned, and the Pattern absorbed their plans,
weaving toward the future foretold.
