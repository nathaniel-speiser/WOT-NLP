PROLOGUE

The First Sparks Fall

Elaida do Avriny a’Roihan absently fingered the long, seven-striped stole about her shoulders,
the stole of the Amyrlin Seat, as she sat behind her wide writing table. Many would have accounted
her beautiful, at first glance, but a second look made it clear that the severity of her ageless, Aes
Sedai face was not a momentary matter. Today there was something more, a light of anger in her dark
eyes. If anyone had noticed.
She barely listened to the women arrayed on stools before her. Their dresses were every color
from white to the darkest red, in silk or wool as each woman’s taste dictated, yet all but one wore
their formal shawls, embroidered White Flame of Tar Valon centered on their backs, colored fringe
proclaiming their Ajahs, as though this were a meeting of the Hall of the Tower. They discussed
reports and rumors of events in the world, trying to sift fact from fancy, trying to decide the Tower’s
course of action, but they seldom even glanced at the woman behind the table, the woman they had
sworn to obey. Elaida could not keep her full attention on them. They did not know what was really
important. Or rather, they knew and feared to speak of it.
“There is apparently something happening in Shienar.” That was Danelle, slight and often
seemingly lost in a dream, the only Brown sister present. Green and Yellow also had only one sister
apiece, and none of the three Ajahs was pleased about that. There were no Blues. Now Danelle’s big
blue eyes looked thoughtfully inward; an unnoticed ink smudge stained her cheek, and her dark gray
wool dress was rumpled. “There are rumors of skirmishes. Not with Trollocs, and not Aiel, though
raids through the Niamh Passes appear to have increased. Between Shienarans. Unusual for the
Borderlands. They seldom fight each other.”
“If they intend to have a civil war, they have chosen the proper time for it,” Alviarin said coolly.
Tall and slim and all in white silk, she was the one without a shawl. The stole of the Keeper around
her shoulders was white also, to show she had been raised from the White Ajah. Not Red, Elaida’s
former Ajah, as tradition held. Whites were always cool. “The Trollocs might as well have vanished.
The entire Blight seems quiet enough for two farmers and a novice to guard.”
Teslyn’s bony fingers shuffled papers on her lap, though she did not look at them. One of four
Red sisters there—more than any other Ajah—she ran Elaida a close second for severity, though no
one had ever thought her beautiful. “Better perhaps if it did no be so quiet,” Teslyn said, her Illianer
accent strong. “I did receive a message this morning that the Marshal-General of Saldaea does have
an army on the move. No toward the Blight, but in the opposite direction. South and east. He would
no ever have done that if the Blight did no seem to be asleep.”
“Then word of Mazrim Taim is seeping out.” Alviarin could have been discussing the weather
or the price of carpets instead of a potential disaster. Much effort had gone into capturing Taim, and

as much into hiding his escape. No good to the Tower if the world learned they could not hold on to a
false Dragon once he was taken. “And it seems that Queen Tenobia, or Davram Bashere, or both,
thinks we cannot be trusted to deal with him again.”
Dead quiet fell at the mention of Taim. The man could channel—he had been on his way to Tar
Valon to be gentled, cut off from the One Power forever, when he was broken free—yet that was not
what curbed tongues. Once the existence of a man able to channel the One Power had been the
deepest anathema; hunting such men down was the main reason of existence for the Red, and every
Ajah helped as it could. But now most of the women beyond the table shifted on their stools, refusing
to meet each other’s eyes, because speaking of Taim brought them too close to another subject they
did not want to speak aloud. Even Elaida felt bile rise in her stomach.
Apparently Alviarin experienced no such reluctance. One corner of her mouth quirked
momentarily in what might have been smile or grimace. “I will redouble our efforts to retake Taim.
And I suggest that a sister be dispatched to counsel Tenobia. Someone used to overcoming the sort of
stubborn resistance that young woman will put up.”
Others rushed to help fill the silence.
Joline shifted her green-fringed shawl on slender shoulders and smiled, though it seemed a bit
forced. “Yes. She needs an Aes Sedai at her shoulder. Someone able to handle Bashere. He has
excessive influence with Tenobia. He must move his army back where it can be used if the Blight
wakes up.” Too much bosom showed in the gap of her shawl, and her pale green silk was too snug,
too clinging. And she smiled too much for Elaida’s liking. Especially at men. Greens always did.
“The last thing we need now is another army on the march,” Shemerin, the Yellow sister, said
quickly. A slightly plump woman, she had somehow never really managed the outward calm of Aes
Sedai; there was often a strain of anxiety around her eyes, and more so of late.
“And someone to Shienar,” added Javindhra, another Red. Despite smooth cheeks, her angular
face was hard enough to hammer nails. Her voice was harsh. “I don’t like trouble of this sort in the
Borderlands. The last thing we need is Shienar weakening itself to the point where a Trolloc army
could break through.”
“Perhaps.” Alviarin nodded, considering. “But there are agents in Shienar—Red, I am sure, and
perhaps others?—” The four Red sisters nodded tightly, reluctantly; no one else did. “—who can
warn us if these small clashes become anything to worry us.”
It was an open secret that every Ajah except the White, devoted to logic and philosophy as it
was, had watchers and listeners scattered through the nations to varying degrees, though the Yellow
network was believed to be a pitiful thing. There was nothing of sickness or Healing they could learn
from those who could not channel. Some individual sisters had their own eyes-and-ears, though
perhaps even more closely guarded than agents of the Ajahs. The Blues had had the most extensive,
both Ajah and personal.
“As for Tenobia and Davram Bashere,” Alviarin went on, “are we agreed that they must be dealt
with by sisters?” She hardly waited for heads to nod. “Good. It is done. Memara will do nicely; she
will take no nonsense from Tenobia, while never letting her see the leash. Now. Does anyone have
fresh word out of Arad Doman or Tarabon? If we do not do something there soon, we may find that
Pedron Niall and the Whitecloaks have sway from Bandar Eban to the Shadow Coast. Evanellein, you
have something?” Arad Doman and Tarabon were racked by civil wars, and worse. There was no
order anywhere. Elaida was surprised they would bring it up.
“Only a rumor,” the Gray sister replied. Her silk dress, matching the fringe on her shawl, was
finely cut and scooped low at the neck. Often Elaida thought the woman should have been Green, so

concerned was she with her looks and clothes. “Almost everyone in those poor lands is a refugee,
including those who might send news. The Panarch Amathera has apparently vanished, and it seems
an Aes Sedai may have been involved. . . .”
Elaida’s hand tightened on her stole. Nothing touched her face, but her eyes smoldered. The
matter of the Saldaean army was done. At least Memara was Red; that was a surprise. But they had
not even asked her opinion. It was done. The startling possibility that an Aes Sedai was involved in
the disappearance of the Panarch—if this was not another of the thousand improbable tales that
drifted from the western coast—could not take Elaida’s mind from that. There were Aes Sedai
scattered from the Aryth Ocean to the Spine of the World, and the Blues at least might do anything.
Less than two months since they had all knelt to swear fealty to her as the embodiment of the White
Tower, and now the decision was made without so much as a glance in her direction.
The Amyrlin’s study sat only a few levels up in the White Tower, yet this room was the heart of
the Tower as surely as the Tower itself, the color of bleached bone, was the heart of the great island
city of Tar Valon, cradled in the River Erinin. And Tar Valon was, or should be, the heart of the
world. The room spoke of the power wielded by the long line of women who had occupied it, floor
of polished redstone from the Mountains of Mist, tall fireplace of golden Kandori marble, walls
paneled in pale, oddly striped wood marvelously carved with unknown birds and beasts more than a
thousand years ago. Stone like glittering pearls framed the tall, arched windows that let onto the
balcony overlooking the Amyrlin’s private garden, the only stone like it known, salvaged from a
nameless city swallowed by the Sea of Storms during the Breaking of the World. A room of power, a
reflection of Amyrlins who had made thrones dance to their calling for nearly three thousand years.
And they did not even ask her opinion.
It happened too often, this slighting. Worst—most bitter of all, perhaps—they usurped her
authority without even thinking of it. They knew how she had come to the stole, knew their aid had put
it on her shoulders. She herself had been too much aware of that. But they presumed too far. It would
soon be time to do something about that. But not quite yet.
She had put her own stamp on the room, as much as possible, with a writing table ornately
carved in triple-linked rings and a heavy chair that raised an inlaid ivory Flame of Tar Valon above
her dark hair like a large snowy teardrop. Three boxes of Altaran lacquerwork were arranged on the
table, precisely equidistant from each other; one held the finest of her collection of carved miniatures.
A white vase on a simple plinth against one wall held red roses that filled the room with sweet
fragrance. There had been no rain since she was raised, but fine blossoms were always available
with the Power; she had always liked flowers. They could be so easily pruned and trained to produce
beauty.
Two paintings hung where, seated, she could see them merely by lifting her head. The others
avoided looking at them; among all the Aes Sedai who came to Elaida’s study, only Alviarin ever so
much as glanced at them.
“Is there any news of Elayne?” Andaya asked diffidently. A thin, birdlike little woman,
outwardly timid despite Aes Sedai features, the second Gray looked an unlikely mediator, but was in
fact one of the best. There were still faint traces of Tarabon in her voice. “Or Galad? If Morgase
discovers that we have lost her stepson, she may begin to ask more questions concerning the
whereabouts of her daughter, yes? And if she learns we have lost the Daughter-Heir, Andor may
become as closed to us as Amadicia.”
A few women shook their heads—there was no news, and Javindhra said, “A Red sister is in
place in the Royal Palace. Newly raised, so she can easily pass for other than Aes Sedai.” She meant

that the woman had not yet taken on the agelessness that came with long use of the Power. Someone
trying to guess the age of any woman in the study would have fumbled over a range of twenty years,
and in some cases would be off by twice that. “She is well trained, though, quite strong, and a good
observer. Morgase is absorbed in putting forward her claim to the Cairhienin throne.” Several
women shifted on their stools, and as if realizing she had stepped close to dangerous ground,
Javindhra hurried on. “And her new lover, Lord Gaebril, seems to be keeping her occupied
otherwise.” Her thin mouth narrowed even further. “She is completely besotted with the man.”
“He keeps her concentrated on Cairhien,” Alviarin said. “The situation there is nearly as bad as
in Tarabon and Arad Doman, with every House contending for the Sun Throne, and famine
everywhere. Morgase will reestablish order, but it will take time for her to have the throne secure.
Until that is done, she will have little energy left to worry about other matters, even the DaughterHeir. And I set a clerk the task of sending occasional letters; the woman does a good imitation of
Elayne’s hand. Morgase will keep until we can secure proper control of her again.”
“At least we still have her son in hand.” Joline smiled.
“Gawyn do hardly be in hand,” Teslyn said sharply. “Those Younglings of his do skirmish with
Whitecloaks on both sides of the river. He does act on his own as much as at our direction.”
“He will be brought under control,” Alviarin said. Elaida was beginning to find that constant
cool composure hateful.
“Speaking of the Whitecloaks,” Danelle put in, “it appears that Pedron Niall is conducting secret
negotiations, trying to convince Altara and Murandy to cede land to Illian, and thus keep the Council
of Nine from invading one or both.”
Safely back from the precipice, the women on the other side of the table nattered on, deciding
whether the Lord Captain Commander’s negotiations might gain too much influence for the Children
of the Light. Perhaps they should be disrupted so the Tower could step in and replace him.
Elaida’s mouth twisted. The Tower had often in its history been cautious of necessity—too many
feared them, too many distrusted them—but it had never feared anything or anyone. Now, it feared.
She raised her eyes to the paintings. One consisted of three wooden panels depicting Bonwhin,
the last Red to have been raised to the Amyrlin Seat, a thousand years before, and the reason no Red
had worn the stole since. Until Elaida. Bonwhin, tall and proud, ordering Aes Sedai in their
manipulations of Artur Hawkwing; Bonwhin, defiant, on the white walls of Tar Valon, under siege by
Hawkwing’s forces; and Bonwhin, kneeling and humbled, before the Hall of the Tower as they
stripped her of stole and staff for nearly destroying the Tower.
Many wondered why Elaida had had the triptych retrieved from the storerooms where it had lain
covered in dust; if none spoke openly, she had still heard the whispers. They did not understand that
constant reminder of the price of failure was necessary.
The second painting was in the new fashion, on stretched canvas, a copy of a street artist’s
sketch from the distant west. That one caused even more unease among the Aes Sedai who saw it.
Two men fought among clouds, seemingly in the sky, wielding lightning for weapons. One had a face
of fire. The other was tall and young, with reddish hair. It was the youth who caused the fear, who
made even Elaida’s teeth clench. She was not sure if it was in anger, or to keep them from chattering.
But fear could and must be controlled. Control was all.
“We are done, then,” Alviarin said, rising smoothly from her stool. The others copied her,
adjusting skirts and shawls in preparation for leaving. “In three days, I will expect—”
“Have I given you leave to go, daughters?” Those were the first words Elaida had spoken since
telling them to be seated. They looked at her in surprise. Surprise! Some moved back toward the

stools, but not with any haste. And not a word of apology. She had let this go on much too long.
“Since you are standing, you will remain so until I am done.” A moment of confusion caught those
half-seated, and she continued as they straightened again uncertainly. “I have heard no mention of the
search for that woman and her companions.”
No need to name that woman, Elaida’s predecessor. They knew who she meant, and Elaida
found it harder every day even to think the former Amyrlin’s name. All of her current problems—all!
—could be laid at that woman’s feet.
“It is difficult,” Alviarin said evenly, “since we have bolstered the rumors that she was
executed.” The woman had ice for blood. Elaida met her eyes firmly until she added a belated
“Mother,” but it, too, was placid, even casual.
Elaida swung her gaze to the others, made her voice steel. “Joline, you have charge of that
search, and of the investigation of her escape. In both cases I hear of nothing but difficulties. Perhaps
a daily penance will help you increase your diligence, daughter. Write out what you think suitable and
submit it to me. Should I find it—less than suitable, I will triple it.”
Joline’s ever-present smile faded in satisfactory fashion. She opened her mouth, then closed it
again under Elaida’s steady stare. Finally, she curtsied deeply. “As you command, Mother.” The
words were tight, the meekness forced, but it would do. For now.
“And what of trying to bring back those who fled?” If anything, Elaida’s tone was even harder.
The return of the Aes Sedai who had run away when that woman was deposed meant the return of
Blues to the Tower. She was not sure she could ever trust any Blue. But then, she was not sure she
could ever bring herself to trust any who had fled instead of hailing her ascension. Yet the Tower
must be whole again.
Javindhra was overseeing that task. “Again, there are difficulties.” Her features remained as
severe as ever, but she licked her lips quickly at the storm that swept silently across Elaida’s face.
“Mother.”
Elaida shook her head. “I will not hear of difficulties, daughter. Tomorrow you will place
before me a list of everything you have done, including all measures taken to see the world does not
learn of any dissension in the Tower.” That was deadly important; there was a new Amyrlin, but the
world must see the Tower as united and strong as ever. “If you do not have enough time for the work I
give you, perhaps you should give up your place as Sitter for the Red in the Hall. I must consider it.”
“That will not be necessary, Mother,” the hard-faced woman said hurriedly. “You will have the
report you require tomorrow. I am sure many will start returning soon.”
Elaida was not so certain, however much she wanted it—the Tower must be strong; it must!—
but her point was made. Troubled thoughtfulness marked every eye but Alviarin’s. If Elaida was
ready to come down on one of her own former Ajah, and even harder on a Green who had been with
her from the first day, perhaps they had made a mistake in treating her as a ceremonial effigy. Perhaps
they had put her on the Amyrlin Seat, but now she was the Amyrlin. A few more examples in the
coming days should drive it home. If necessary, she would have every woman here doing penance till
they begged mercy.
“There are Tairen soldiers in Cairhien, as well as Andoran,” she went on, ignoring averted eyes.
“Tairen soldiers sent by the man who took the Stone of Tear.” Shemerin clasped her plump hands
tight, and Teslyn flinched. Only Alviarin remained unruffled as a frozen pond. Elaida flung out her
hand and pointed to the painting of two men fighting with lightning. “Look at it. Look! Or I will have
every last one of you on hands and knees scrubbing floors! If you have not the backbone even to look
at a painting, what courage can you have for what is to come? Cowards are no use to the Tower!”

Slowly they raised their eyes, shuffling feet like nervous girls instead of Aes Sedai. Only
Alviarin merely looked, and only she appeared untouched. Shemerin wrung her hands, and tears
actually welled in her eyes. Something would have to be done about Shemerin.
“Rand al’Thor. A man who can channel.” The words left Elaida’s mouth like a whip. They made
her own stomach knot up till she feared she might vomit. Somehow she kept her face smooth and
pressed on, pushed the words out, stones from a sling. “A man fated to go mad and wreak horror with
the Power before he dies. But more than that. Arad Doman and Tarabon and everything between is a
ruin of rebellion because of him. If the war and famine in Cairhien cannot be tied to him of a
certainty, he surely precipitates a greater war there, between Tear and Andor, when the Tower needs
peace! In Ghealdan, some mad Shienaran preaches of him to crowds too great for Alliandre’s army to
contain. The greatest danger the Tower has ever faced, the greatest threat the world has ever faced,
and you cannot make yourselves speak of him? You cannot gaze at his image?”
Silence answered her. All save Alviarin looked as though their tongues were frozen. Most stared
at the young man in the painting, birds hypnotized by a snake.
“Rand al’Thor.” The name tasted bitter on Elaida’s lips. Once she had had that young man, so
innocent in appearance, within arm’s reach. And she had not seen what he was. Her predecessor had
known—had known for the Light alone knew how long, and had left him to run wild. That woman had
told her a great deal before escaping, had said things, when put hard to the question, that Elaida
would not let herself believe—if the Forsaken were truly free, all might be lost—but somehow she
had managed to refuse some answers. And then escaped before she could be put to the question again.
That woman and Moiraine. That woman and the Blue had known all along. Elaida intended to have
them both back in the Tower. They would tell every last scrap of what they knew. They would plead
on their knees for death before she was done.
She forced herself to go on, though the words curdled in her mouth. “Rand al’Thor is the Dragon
Reborn, daughters.” Shemerin’s knees gave way, and she sat down hard on the floor. Some of the
others appeared to have weak knees as well. Elaida’s eyes flogged them with scorn. “There can be no
doubt of it. He is the one spoken of in the Prophecies. The Dark One is breaking free of his prison, the
Last Battle is coming, and the Dragon Reborn must be there to face him or the world is doomed to fire
and destruction so long as the Wheel of Time turns. And he runs free, daughters. We do not know
where he is. We know a dozen places he is not. He is no longer in Tear. He is not here in the Tower,
safely shielded, as he should be. He brings the whirlwind down on the world, and we must stop it if
there is to be any hope of surviving Tarmon Gai’don. We must have him in hand to see he fights in the
Last Battle. Or do any of you believe he will go willingly to his prophesied death to save the world?
A man who must be going mad already? We must have him in control!”
“Mother,” Alviarin began with that irritating lack of emotion, but Elaida stopped her with a
glare.
“Putting our hands on Rand al’Thor is more important by far than skirmishes in Shienar or
whether the Blight is quiet, more important than finding Elayne or Galad, more important even than
Mazrim Taim. You will find him. You will! When next I see you, each of you will be ready to tell me
in detail what you have done to make it so. Now you may leave me, daughters.”
A ripple of unsteady curtsies, breathy murmurs of “As you command, Mother,” and they came
close to running, Joline helping Shemerin wobble to her feet. The Yellow sister would do nicely for
the next example; some would be necessary, to make sure none of them slid back, and she was too
weak to be allowed in this council. Of course, this council would not be allowed to continue much
longer in any case. The Hall would hear her words, and leap.

All save Alviarin went.
For a long moment after the door had closed behind the others, the two women met each other’s
eyes. Alviarin had been the first, the very first, to hear and agree with the charges against Elaida’s
predecessor. And Alviarin knew full well why she wore the Keeper’s stole instead of someone from
the Red. The Red Ajah had favored Elaida unanimously, but the White had not done so, and without
wholehearted support from the White, many others might not have come round, in which case Elaida
would have been in a cell instead of sitting on the Amyrlin Seat. That is, if the remains of her head
were not decorating a spike for the ravens to play with. Alviarin would not be so easily intimidated
as the others. If she could be intimidated at all. There was a disturbing feel of equal-to-equal in
Alviarin’s unwavering gaze.
A tap at the door sounded loud in the quiet.
“Come!” Elaida snapped.
One of the Accepted, a pale, slender girl, stepped hesitantly into the room and immediately
dropped a curtsy so low her white skirt with its seven bands of color at the hem made a wide pool
around her on the floor. From the wideness of her blue eyes and the way she kept them on the floor,
she had caught the mood of the women leaving. Where Aes Sedai left shaking, an Accepted went at
great peril. “M-Mother, Master F-Fain is here. He said you w-would see him at th-this hour.” The
girl swayed in her crouch, on the point of falling over from stark fear.
“Then send him in, girl, instead of keeping him waiting,” Elaida growled, but she would have
had the girl’s hide if she had not kept the man outside. The anger she held back from Alviarin—she
would not let herself think that she did not dare show it—that anger welled up. “And if you cannot
learn to speak properly, perhaps the kitchens are a better place for you than the Amyrlin’s anteroom.
Well? Are you going to do as you were told? Move, girl! And tell the Mistress of Novices you need
to be taught to obey with alacrity!”
The girl squeaked something that might have been a correct response and darted out.
With an effort, Elaida got hold of herself. It did not concern her whether Silviana, the new
Mistress of Novices, beat the girl to incoherence or let her off with a lecture. She barely saw novices
or Accepted unless they intruded on her, and cared less. It was Alviarin she wanted humbled and on
her knees.
But Fain, now. She tapped one finger against her lips. A bony little man with a big nose, who
had appeared at the Tower only days earlier in dirty, once-fine clothes too big for him, arrogant and
cringing by turns, seeking audience with the Amyrlin. Except for those who served the Tower, men
came there only under duress or in great need, and none asked to speak to the Amyrlin. A fool, in
some ways, or conceivably a half-wit; he claimed to be from Lugard, in Murandy, but spoke in
various accents, sometimes slipping from one to another in midsentence. Yet it seemed he might be
useful.
Alviarin was still looking at her, so icily complacent, just a hint in her eyes of the questions she
must have about Fain. Elaida’s face hardened. Almost she reached for saidar, the female half of the
True Source, to teach the woman her place with the Power. But that was not the way. Alviarin might
even resist, and fighting like a farmgirl in a stableyard was no method for the Amyrlin to make her
authority plain. Yet Alviarin would learn to yield to her as surely as the others would. The first step
would be leaving Alviarin in the dark concerning Master Fain, or whatever his real name was.
Padan Fain put the frantic young Accepted out of his mind as he stepped into the Amyrlin’s
study; she was a toothsome bit, and he liked them fluttering like birds in the hand, but there were more

important matters to concentrate on now. Dry-washing his hands, he ducked his head suitably low,
suitably humbly, but the two awaiting him seemed unaware of his presence at first, locked eye-to-eye
as they were. It was all he could do not to stretch out a hand to caress the tension between them.
Tension and division wove everywhere through the White Tower. All to the good. Tension could be
tweaked, division exploited, as need be.
He had been surprised to find Elaida on the Amyrlin Seat. Better than what he had expected,
though. In many ways she was not so tough, he had heard, as the woman who had worn the stole
before her. Harder, yes, and more cruel, but more brittle, too. More difficult to bend, likely, but
easier to break. If either became necessary. Still, one Aes Sedai, one Amyrlin even, was much like
another to him. Fools. Dangerous fools, true, but useful dupes at times.
Finally they realized he was there, the Amyrlin frowning slightly at being taken by surprise, the
Keeper of the Chronicles unchanging. “You may go now, daughter,” Elaida said firmly, a slight but
definite emphasis on “now.” Oh, yes. The tensions, the cracks in power. Cracks where seeds could be
planted. Fain caught himself on the point of giggling.
Alviarin hesitated before giving the briefest of curtsies. As she swept out of the room, her eyes
brushed across him, expressionless yet disconcerting. Unconsciously he huddled, hunching his
shoulders protectively; his upper lip fluttered in a half-snarl at her slim back. On occasion he had the
feeling, just for an instant, that she knew too much about him, but he could not have said why. Her
cool face, cool eyes, they never changed. At those times he wanted to make them change. Fear.
Agony. Pleading. He nearly laughed at the thought. No point, of course. She could know nothing.
Patience, and he could be done with her and her never-changing eyes.
The Tower held things worth a little patience in its strongrooms. The Horn of Valere was there,
the fabled Horn made to call dead heroes back from the grave for the Last Battle. Even most of the
Aes Sedai were ignorant of that, but he knew how to sniff out things. The dagger was there. He felt its
pull where he stood. He could have pointed to it. It was his, a part of him, stolen and mired away here
by these Aes Sedai. Having the dagger would make up for so much lost; he was not sure how, but he
was sure it would. For Aridhol lost. Too dangerous to return to Aridhol, perchance to be trapped
there again. He shivered. So long trapped. Not again.
Of course, no one called it Aridhol any longer, but Shadar Logoth. Where the Shadow Waits. An
apt name. So much had changed. Even himself. Padan Fain. Mordeth. Ordeith. Sometimes he was
uncertain which name was really his, who he really was. One thing was sure. He was not what
anyone thought. Those who believed they knew him were badly mistaken. He was transfigured, now.
A force unto himself, and beyond any other power. They would all learn, eventually.
Suddenly he realized with a start that the Amyrlin had said something. Casting about in his mind,
he found it. “Yes, Mother, the coat suits me very well.” He ran a hand down the black velvet to show
how fine he found it, as if garments mattered. “ ’Tis a very good coat. I am thanking you kindly,
Mother.” He was prepared to suffer more of her trying to make him feel at ease, ready to kneel and
kiss her ring, but this time she went straight to the heart.
“Tell me more of what you know of Rand al’Thor, Master Fain.”
Fain’s eyes went to the painting of the two men, and as he gazed at it, his back straightened.
Al’Thor’s portrait tugged at him almost as much as the man would, sent rage and hate roiling along
his veins. Because of that young man, he had suffered pain beyond remembering, pain he did not let
himself remember, and suffered far worse than pain. He had been broken and remade because of
al’Thor. Of course, that remaking had given him the means of revenge, but that was beside the point.
Beside his desire for al’Thor’s destruction, everything else dimmed from sight.

When he turned back to the Amyrlin, he did not realize his manner was as commanding as hers,
meeting her stare for stare. “Rand al’Thor is devious and sly, uncaring of anyone or anything but his
own power.” Fool woman. “He’s never a one to do what you expect.” But if she could put al’Thor in
his hands. . . . “He is difficult to lead—very difficult—but I believe it can be done. First you must tie
a string to one of the few he trusts. . . .” If she gave him al’Thor, he might leave her alive when he
finally went, even if she was Aes Sedai.
Lounging in a gilded chair in his shirtsleeves, one booted leg over the padded arm, Rahvin
smiled as the woman standing before the fireplace repeated what he had told her. There was a slight
glaze in her large, brown eyes. A young, pretty woman, even in the plain gray woolens she had
adopted for disguise, but that was not what interested him about her.
No breath of air stirred through the room’s tall windows. Sweat rolled down the woman’s face
as she spoke, and beaded on the narrow face of the other man present. For all of that man’s fine red
silk coat with its golden embroidery, he stood as stiffly as a servant, which he was in a way, if of his
own free will, unlike the woman. Of course, he was deaf and blind for the moment.
Rahvin handled the flows of Spirit he had woven around the pair delicately. There was no need
to damage valuable servants.
He did not sweat, of course. He did not let the summer’s lingering heat touch him. He was a tall
man, large, dark and handsome despite the white streaking his temples. Compulsion had presented no
difficulties with this woman.
A scowl twisted his face. It did with some. A few—a very few—had a strength of self so firm
that their minds searched, even if unaware, for crevices through which to slide away. It was his bad
luck that he still had some small need for one such. She could be handled, but she kept trying to find
escape without knowing she was trapped. Eventually that one would no longer be needed, of course;
he would have to decide whether to send her on her way or be rid of her more permanently. Dangers
lay either way. Nothing that could threaten him, of course, but he was a careful man, meticulous.
Small dangers had a way of growing if ignored, and he always chose his risks with a measure of
prudence. To kill her, or keep her?
The cessation of the woman’s speech pulled him from his reverie. “When you leave here,” he
told her, “you will remember nothing of this visit. You will remember only taking your usual morning
walk.” She nodded, eager to please him, and he tied off the strands of Spirit lightly, so they would
evaporate from her mind shortly after she reached the street. Repeated use of compulsion made
obedience easier even when it was not in use, but while it was, there was always a danger it might be
detected.
That done, he released Elegar’s mind as well. Lord Elegar. A minor noble, but faithful to his
vows. He licked his thin lips nervously and glanced at the woman, then went immediately to one knee
before Rahvin. Friends of the Dark—Darkfriends they were called, now—had begun learning just
how strictly they would be kept to their vows now that Rahvin and the others were freed.
“Take her to the street by back ways,” Rahvin said, “and leave her there. She is not to be seen.”
“It will be as you say, Great Master,” Elegar said, bowing where he knelt. Rising, he backed
from Rahvin’s presence, bowing and pulling the woman along by one arm. She went docilely, of
course, her eyes still fogged. Elegar would ask her no questions. He knew enough to be well aware
that there were things he did not want to know.
“One of your play pretties?” a woman’s voice said behind him as the carved door closed. “Have
you taken to dressing them like that?”

Snatching at saidin, he filled himself with the Power, the taint on the male half of the True
Source rolling off the protection of his bonds and oaths, the ties to what he knew as a greater power
than the Light, or even the Creator.
In the middle of the chamber a gateway stood above the red-and-gold carpet, an opening to
somewhere else. He had a brief view of a chamber lined with snowy silken hangings before it
vanished, leaving a woman, clad in white and belted in woven silver. The slight tingle in his skin,
like a faint chill, was all that told him she had channeled. Tall and slender, she was as beautiful as he
was handsome, her dark eyes bottomless pools, her hair, decorated with silver stars and crescents,
falling in perfect black waves to her shoulders. Most men would have felt their mouths go dry with
desire.
“What do you mean to come sneaking up on me, Lanfear?” he demanded roughly. He did not let
go of the Power, but rather prepared several nasty surprises in case he had need. “If you want to
speak with me, send an emissary, and I will decide when and where. And if.”
Lanfear smiled that sweet, treacherous smile. “You were always a pig, Rahvin, but seldom a
fool. That woman is Aes Sedai. What if they miss her? Do you also send out heralds to announce
where you are?”
“Channel?” he sneered. “She is not strong enough to be allowed outdoors without a keeper. They
call untutored children Aes Sedai when half of what they know is self-taught tricks and the other half
barely scratches the surface.”
“Would you still be so complacent if those untutored children put a circle of thirteen around
you?” The cool mockery in her voice stabbed him, but he did not let it show.
“I take my precautions, Lanfear. Rather than one of my ‘play pretties,’ as you call them, she is
the Tower’s spy here. Now she reports exactly what I want her to, and she is eager to do so. Those
who serve the Chosen in the Tower told me right where to find her.” The day would come soon when
the world gave up the name Forsaken and knelt to the Chosen. It had been promised, so very long ago.
“Why have you come, Lanfear? Surely not in aid of defenseless women.”
She merely shrugged. “You can play with your toys as much as you wish, so far as I am
concerned. You offer little in the way of hospitality, Rahvin, so you will forgive me if . . .” A silver
pitcher rose from a small table by Rahvin’s bed and tilted to pour dark wine into a gold-chased
goblet. As the pitcher settled, the goblet floated to Lanfear’s hand. He felt nothing beyond a slight
tingle, of course, saw no flows being woven; he had never liked that. That she would be able to see
as little of his weaving was only a slight redressing of the balance.
“Why?” he demanded again.
She sipped calmly before speaking. “Since you avoid the rest of us, a few of the Chosen will be
coming here. I came first so you would know it is not an attack.”
“Others? Some plan of yours? What need have I of someone else’s designs?” Suddenly he
laughed, a deep, rich sound. “So it is no attack, is it? You were never one for attacking openly, were
you? Not as bad as Moghedien, perhaps, but you did always favor the flanks and the rear. I will trust
you this time, enough to hear you out. As long as you are under my eye.” Who trusted Lanfear behind
him deserved the knife he might well find in his back. Not that she was so very trustworthy even when
watched; her temper was uncertain at best. “Who else is supposed to be part of this?”
He had clearer warning this time—it was male work—as another gateway opened, showing
marble arches opening onto wide stone balconies, and gulls wheeling and crying in a cloudless blue
sky. Finally a man appeared and stepped through, the way closing behind him.
Sammael was compact, solid and larger-seeming than he truly was, his stride quick and active,

his manner abrupt. Blue-eyed and golden-haired, with a neat square-trimmed beard, he would
perhaps have been above the ordinary in looks except for a slanting scar, as if a red-hot poker had
been dragged across his face from hairline to jaw. He could have had it removed as soon as it was
made, all those long years ago, but he had elected not to.
Linked to saidin as tightly as Rahvin—this close Rahvin could feel it, dimly—Sammael eyed
him warily. “I expected serving maids and dancing girls, Rahvin. Have you finally wearied of your
sport after all these years?” Lanfear laughed softly into her wine.
“Did someone mention sport?”
Rahvin had not even noticed the opening of a third gateway, showing a large room full of pools
and fluted columns, nearly nude acrobats and attendants wearing less. Oddly, a lean old man in a
wrinkled coat sat disconsolately among the performers. Two servants in filmy bits of nothing much, a
well-muscled man bearing a wrought-gold tray and a beautiful, voluptuous woman, anxiously pouring
wine from a cut-crystal flagon into a matching goblet on the tray, followed the true arrival before the
opening winked out.
In any other company but Lanfear’s, Graendal would have been accounted a stunningly beautiful
woman, lush and ripe. Her gown was green silk, cut low. A ruby the size of a hen’s egg nestled
between her breasts, and a coronet encrusted with more rested on her long, sun-colored hair. Beside
Lanfear she was merely plumply pretty. If the inevitable comparison bothered her, her amused smile
gave no sign of it.
Golden bracelets clattered as she waved a heavily beringed hand generally behind her; the
female servant quickly slipped the goblet into her grasp with a fawning smile mirrored by the man.
Graendal took no notice. “So,” she said gaily. “Nearly half the surviving Chosen in one place. And no
one trying to kill anyone. Who would have expected it before the Great Lord of the Dark returns?
Ishamael did manage to keep us from one another’s throats for a time, but this . . .”
“Do you always speak so freely in front of your servants?” Sammael said with a grimace.
Graendal blinked, glanced back at the pair as if she had forgotten them. “They won’t speak out of
turn. They worship me. Don’t you?” The two fell to their knees, practically babbling their fervent
love of her. It was real; they actually did love her. Now. After a moment, she frowned slightly, and
the servants froze, mouths open in midword. “They do go on. Still, they won’t bother you now, will
they?”
Rahvin shook his head, wondering who they were, or had been. Physical beauty was not enough
for Graendal’s servants; they had to have power or position as well. A former lord for a footman, a
lady to draw her bath; that was Graendal’s taste. Indulging herself was one thing, but she was
wasteful. This pair might have been of use, properly manipulated, but the level of compulsion
Graendal employed surely left them good for little more than decoration. The woman had no true
finesse.
“Should I expect more, Lanfear?” he growled. “Have you convinced Demandred to stop thinking
he is all but the Great Lord’s heir?”
“I doubt he is arrogant enough for that,” Lanfear replied smoothly. “He can see where it took
Ishamael. And that is the point. A point Graendal raised. Once we were thirteen, immortal. Now four
are dead, and one has betrayed us. We four are all who meet here today, and enough.”
“Are you certain Asmodean went over?” Sammael demanded. “He never had the courage to take
a chance before. Where did he find the heart to join a lost cause?”
Lanfear’s brief smile was amused. “He had the courage for an ambush he thought would set him
above the rest of us. And when his choice became death or a doomed cause, it took little courage for

him to choose.”
“And little time, I’ll wager.” The scar made Sammael’s sneer even more biting. “If you were
close enough to him to know all of this, why did you leave him alive? You could have killed him
before he knew you were there.”
“I am not as quick to kill as you. It is final, with no going back, and there are usually other, more
profitable ways. Besides, to put it in terms you would understand, I did not want to launch a frontal
assault against superior forces.”
“Is he really so strong?” Rahvin asked quietly. “This Rand al’Thor. Could he have overwhelmed
you, face-to-face?” Not that he himself could not, if it came to it, or Sammael, though Graendal would
likely link with Lanfear if either of the men tried. For that matter, both women were probably filled to
bursting with the Power right that moment, ready to strike at the slightest suspicion of either man. Or
of each other. But this farmboy. An untrained shepherd! Untrained unless Asmodean was trying.
“He is Lews Therin Telamon reborn,” Lanfear said just as softly, “and Lews Therin was as
strong as any.” Sammael absently rubbed the scar across his face; it had been Lews Therin who gave
it to him. Three thousand years ago and more, well before the Breaking of the World, before the Great
Lord was imprisoned, before so much, but Sammael never forgot.
“Well,” Graendal put in, “have we come around at last to what we are here to discuss?”
Rahvin gave a displeased start. The two servants were frozen still—or again, rather. Sammael
muttered in his beard.
“If this Rand al’Thor really is Lews Therin Telamon reborn,” Graendal went on, settling herself
on the man’s back where he crouched on all fours, “I am surprised you haven’t tried to snuggle him
into your bed, Lanfear. Or would it be so easy? I seem to remember Lews Therin led you by the nose,
not the other way around. Squelched your little tantrums. Sent you running to fetch his wine, in a
manner of speaking.” She set her own wine on the tray, held out rigidly by the sightlessly kneeling
woman. “You were so obsessed with him you’d have stretched out at his feet if he said ‘rug.’ ”
Lanfear’s dark eyes glittered for a moment before she regained control of herself. “He may be
Lews Therin reborn, but he is not Lews Therin himself.”
“How do you know?” Graendal asked, smiling as if it were all a joke. “It may well be that, as
many believe, all are born and reborn as the Wheel turns, but nothing like this has ever happened that
I have read. A specific man reborn according to prophecy. Who knows what he is?”
Lanfear gave a disparaging smirk. “I have observed him closely. He is no more than the
shepherd he seems, still more naive than not.” Scorn faded to seriousness. “But now he has
Asmodean, weak ally as he is. And even before Asmodean, four of the Chosen have died confronting
him.”
“Let him whittle away the dead wood,” Sammael said gruffly. He wove flows of Air to drag a
chair across the carpet and sprawled with his boots crossed at the ankle and one arm over the low,
carved back. Anyone who believed he was at ease was a fool; Sammael had always liked to dupe his
enemies into thinking they could take him by surprise. “More for the rest of us on the Day of Return.
Or do you think he might win Tarmon Gai’don, Lanfear? Even if he stiffens Asmodean’s backbone, he
has no Hundred Companions this time. With Asmodean or alone, the Great Lord will extinguish him
like a broken sar-light.”
The look Lanfear gave him bristled with contempt. “How many of us will be alive when the
Great Lord is freed at last? Four gone already. Will he come after you next, Sammael? You might like
that. You could finally get rid of that scar if you defeated him. But I forget. How many times did you
face him in the War of Power? Did you ever win? I cannot seem to remember.” Without pause she

rounded on Graendal. “Or it might be you. He is reluctant to hurt women for some reason, but you
won’t even be able to make Asmodean’s choice. You cannot teach him any more than a stone could.
Unless he decides to keep you as a pet. That would be a change for you, would it not? Instead of
deciding which of your pretties pleases you best, you could learn to please.”
Graendal’s face contorted, and Rahvin prepared to shield himself against whatever the two
women might hurl at one another, prepared to Travel at even a whiff of balefire. Then he sensed
Sammael gathering the Power, sensed a difference in it—Sammael would call it seizing a tactical
advantage—and bent to grab the other man’s arm. Sammael shook him off angrily, but the moment had
passed. The two women were looking at them now, not each other. Neither could know what had
almost happened, but clearly something had passed between Rahvin and Sammael, and suspicion lit
their eyes.
“I want to hear what Lanfear has to say.” He did not look at Sammael, but meant it for him.
“There must be more to this than a foolish attempt to frighten us.” Sammael jerked his head in what
might have been a nod or merely disgruntlement. It would have to do.
“Oh, there is, though a little fright could not hurt.” Lanfear’s dark eyes still held distrust, but her
voice was as clear as still water. “Ishamael tried to control him and failed, tried to kill him in the end
and failed, but Ishamael tried bullying and fear, and bullying does not work with Rand al’Thor.”
“Ishamael was more than half-mad,” Sammael muttered, “and less than half-human.”
“Is that what we are?” Graendal arched an eyebrow. “Merely human? Surely we are something
more. This is human.” She stroked a finger down the cheek of the woman kneeling beside her. “A new
word will have to be created to describe us.”
“Whatever we are,” Lanfear said, “we can succeed where Ishamael failed.” She was leaning
slightly forward, as if to force the words on them. Lanfear seldom showed tension. Why now?
“Why only we four?” Rahvin asked. The other “why” would have to wait.
“Why more?” was Lanfear’s reply. “If we can present the Dragon Reborn kneeling to the Great
Lord on the Day of Return, why share the honor—and the rewards—further than need be? And
perhaps he can even be used to—how did you put it, Sammael?—whittle away the dead wood.”
It was the sort of answer Rahvin could understand. Not that he trusted her, of course, or any of
the others, but he understood ambition. The Chosen had plotted among themselves for position up to
the day Lews Therin had imprisoned them in sealing up the Great Lord’s prison, and they had begun
again the day they were freed. He just had to be sure Lanfear’s plot did not disrupt his own plans.
“Speak on,” he told her.
“First, someone else is trying to control him. Perhaps to kill. I suspect Moghedien or
Demandred. Moghedien has always tried to work from the shadows, and Demandred always did hate
Lews Therin.” Sammael smiled, or perhaps grimaced, but his hatred was a pale thing beside
Demandred’s, though for better cause.
“How do you know it is not one of us here?” Graendal asked glibly.
Lanfear’s smile showed as many teeth as the other woman’s, and as little warmth. “Because you
three choose to carve out niches for yourselves and secure your power while the rest slash at each
other. And other reasons. I told you I keep a close watch on Rand al’Thor.”
It was true, what she said of them. Rahvin himself preferred diplomacy and manipulation to open
conflict, though he would not shy from it if needed. Sammael’s way had always been armies and
conquest; he would not go near Lews Therin, even reborn as a shepherd, until he was sure of victory.
Graendal, too, followed conquest, though her methods did not involve soldiers; for all her concern
with her toys, she took one solid step at a time. Openly to be sure, as the Chosen reckoned such

things, but never stretching too far at any step.
“You know I can keep an eye on him unseen,” Lanfear continued, “but the rest of you must stay
clear or run the risk of detection. We must draw him back. . . .”
Graendal leaned forward, interested, and Sammael began to nod as she went on. Rahvin
reserved judgment. It might well work. And if not . . . If not, he saw several ways to shape events to
his advantage. This might work out very well indeed.

CHAPTER
1

Fanning the Sparks

The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend.
Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again. In
one Age, called the Third Age by some, an Age yet to come, an Age long past, a wind rose in the
great forest called Braem Wood. The wind was not the beginning. There are neither beginnings nor
endings to the turning of the Wheel of Time. But it was a beginning.
South and west it blew, dry, beneath a sun of molten gold. There had been no rain for long weeks
in the land below, and the late-summer heat grew day by day. Brown leaves come early dotted some
trees, and naked stones baked where small streams had run. In an open place where grass had
vanished and only thin, withered brush held the soil with its roots, the wind began uncovering longburied stones. They were weathered and worn, and no human eye would have recognized them for the
remains of a city remembered in story yet otherwise forgotten.
Scattered villages appeared before the wind crossed the border of Andor, and fields where
worried farmers trudged arid furrows. The forest had long since thinned to thickets by the time the
wind swept dust down the lone street of a village called Kore Springs. The springs were beginning to
run low this summer. A few dogs lay panting in the swelter, and two shirtless boys ran, beating a
stuffed bladder along the ground with sticks. Nothing else stirred, save the wind and the dust and the
creaking sign above the door of the inn, red brick and thatch-roofed like every other building along
the street. At two stories, it was the tallest and largest structure in Kore Springs, a neat and orderly
little town. The saddled horses hitched in front of the inn barely twitched their tails. The inn’s carved
sign proclaimed the Good Queen’s Justice.
Blinking against the dust, Min kept an eye pressed to the crack in the shed’s rough wall. She
could just make out one shoulder of the guard on the shed door, but her attention was all for the inn
further on. She wished the name were less ominously apt. Their judge, the local lord, had apparently
arrived some time ago, but she had missed seeing him. No doubt he was hearing the farmer’s charges;
Admer Nem, along with his brothers and cousins and all their wives, had seemed in favor of an
immediate hanging before one of the lord’s retainers happened by. She wondered what the penalty
was here for burning up a man’s barn, and his milkcows with it. By accident, of course, but she did
not think that would count for much when it all began with trespass.
Logain had gotten away in the confusion, abandoning them—he would, burn him!—and she did
not know whether to be happy about that or not. It was he who had knocked Nem down when they
were discovered just before dawn, sending the man’s lantern flying into the straw. The blame was
his, if anyone’s. Only sometimes he had trouble watching what he said. Perhaps as well he was gone.
Twisting to lean back against the wall, she wiped sweat from her brow, though it only sprang out

again. The inside of the shed was stifling, but her two companions did not appear to notice. Siuan lay
stretched out on her back in a dark woolen riding dress much like Min’s, staring at the shed roof, idly
tapping her chin with a straw. Coppery-skinned Leane, willowy and as tall as most men, sat crosslegged in her pale shift, working on her dress with needle and thread. They had been allowed to keep
their saddlebags, after they were searched for swords or axes or anything else that might help them
escape.
“What’s the penalty for burning down a barn in Andor?” Min asked.
“If we are lucky,” Siuan replied without moving, “a strapping in the village square. Not so
lucky, and it will be a flogging.”
“Light!” Min breathed. “How can you call that luck?”
Siuan rolled onto her side and propped herself up on an elbow. She was a sturdy woman, short
of beautiful though beyond handsome, and looked no more than a few years older than Min, but those
sharp blue eyes had a commanding presence that did not belong on a young woman awaiting trial in a
backcountry shed. Sometimes Siuan was as bad as Logain about forgetting herself; maybe worse.
“When a strapping is done,” she said in a brook-no-nonsense, do-not-be-foolish tone, “it is done, and
we can be on our way. It wastes less of our time than any other penalty I can think of. Considerably
less than hanging, say. Though I don’t think it will come to that, from what I remember of Andoran
law.”
Wheezing laughter shook Min for a moment; it was that or cry. “Time? The way we are going,
we’ve nothing but time. I swear we have been through every village between here and Tar Valon, and
found nothing. Not a glimmer, not a whisper. I don’t think there is any gathering. And we are on foot,
now. From what I overheard, Logain took the horses with him. Afoot and locked in a shed awaiting
the Light knows what!”
“Watch names,” Siuan whispered sharply, shooting a meaning glance at the rough door with the
guard on the other side. “A flapping tongue can put you in the net instead of the fish.”
Min grimaced, partly because she was growing tired of Siuan’s Tairen fisherman’s sayings, and
partly because the other woman was right. So far they had outrun awkward news—deadly was a
better word than awkward—but some news had a way of leaping a hundred miles in a day. Siuan had
been traveling as Mara, Leane as Amaena, and Logain had taken the name Dalyn, after Siuan
convinced him Guaire was a fool’s choice. Min still did not think anyone would recognize her own
name, but Siuan insisted on calling her Serenla. Even Logain did not know their true names.
The real trouble was that Siuan was not going to give up. Weeks of utter failure, and now this,
yet any mention of heading for Tear, which was sensible, set off a tempest that quailed even Logain.
The longer they had searched without finding what Siuan sought, the more temper she had developed.
Not that she couldn’t crack rocks with it before. Min was wise enough to keep that particular
thought to herself.
Leane finally finished with her dress and tugged it on over her head, doubling her arms behind
her to do up the buttons. Min could not see why she had gone to the trouble; she herself hated
needlework of any sort. The neckline was a little lower now, showing a bit of Leane’s bosom, and it
fit in a snugger way there and perhaps around the hips. But what was the point, here? No one was
going to ask her to dance in this roasting shed.
Digging into Min’s saddlebags, Leane pulled out the wooden box of paints and powders and
whatnots that Laras had forced on Min before they set out. Min had kept meaning to throw it away, but
somehow she had never gotten around to it. There was a small mirror inside the hinged lid of the box,
and in moments Leane was at work on her face with small rabbit-fur brushes. She had never shown

any particular interest in the things before. Now she appeared vexed that there was only a blackwood
hairbrush and a small ivory comb to use on her hair. She even muttered about the lack of a way to heat
the curling iron! Her dark hair had grown since they began Siuan’s search, but it still came well short
of her shoulders.
After watching a bit, Min asked, “What are you up to, Le—Amaena?” She avoided looking at
Siuan. She could guard her tongue; it was just being cooped up and baked alive, that on top of the
coming trial. A hanging or a public strapping. What a choice! “Have you decided to take up flirting?”
It was meant for a joke—Leane was all business and efficiency—something to lighten the moment, but
the other woman surprised her.
“Yes,” Leane said briskly, peering wide-eyed into the mirror while she carefully did something
to her eyelashes. “And if I flirt with the right man, perhaps we will not need to worry about
strappings or anything else. At the least, I might get us lighter sentences.”
Hand half-raised to wipe her face again, Min gasped—it was like an owl announcing it meant to
become a hummingbird—but Siuan merely sat up facing Leane with a level “What brought this on?”
Had Siuan directed that gaze at her, Min suspected she would have confessed to things she had
forgotten. When Siuan concentrated on you like that, you found yourself curtsying and leaping to do as
you were told before you realized it. Even Logain did, most of the time. Except for the curtsy.
Leane calmly stroked a tiny brush along her cheekbones and examined the result in the small
mirror. She did glance at Siuan, but whatever she saw, she answered in the same crisp tones she
always used. “My mother was a merchant, you know, in furs and timber mainly. I once saw her fog a
Saldaean lord’s mind till he consigned his entire year’s timber harvest to her for half the amount he
wanted, and I doubt he realized what had happened until he was nearly back home. If then. He sent
her a moonstone bracelet, later. Domani women don’t deserve the whole reputation they have—stiffnecked prigs going by hearsay built most of it—but we have earned some. My mother and my aunts
taught me along with my sisters and cousins, of course.”
Looking down at herself, she shook her head, then returned to her ministrations with a sigh. “But
I fear I was as tall as I am today on my fourteenth naming day. All knees and elbows, like a colt that
grew too fast. And not long after I could walk across a room without tripping twice, I learned—” She
drew a deep breath. “—learned my life would take me another way than being a merchant. And now
that is gone, too. About time I put to use what I was taught all those years ago. Under the
circumstances, I can’t think of a better time or place.”
Siuan studied her shrewdly a moment more. “That isn’t the reason. Not the whole reason. Out
with it.”
Hurling a small brush into the box, Leane blazed up in a fury. “The whole reason? I do not know
the whole reason. I only know I need something in my life to replace—what is gone. You yourself
told me that is the only hope of surviving. Revenge falls short, for me. I know your cause is necessary,
and perhaps even right, but the Light help me, that is not enough either; I can’t make myself be as
involved as you. Maybe I came too late to it. I will stay with you, but it isn’t enough.”
Anger faded as she began resealing pots and vials and replacing them, though she used more
force than was strictly necessary. There was the merest hint of rose scent about her. “I know flirting
isn’t something to fill up the emptiness, but it is enough to fill an idle moment. Maybe being who I
was born to be will suffice. I just do not know. This isn’t a new idea; I always wanted to be like my
mother and my aunts, daydreamed of it sometimes after I was grown.”
Leane’s face became pensive, and the last things went into the box more gently. “I think perhaps
I’ve always felt I was masquerading as someone else, building up a mask until it became second

nature. There was serious work to be done, more serious than merchanting, and by the time I realized
there was another way I could have gone even so, I had the mask on too firmly to take off. Well, that
is done with, now, and the mask is coming off. I even considered beginning with Logain a week ago,
for practice. But I am out of practice, and I think he is the kind of man who might hear more promises
than you meant to offer, and expect to have them fulfilled.” A small smile suddenly appeared on her
lips. “My mother always said if that happened, you had miscalculated badly; if there was no back
way out, you had to either abandon dignity and run, or pay the price and consider it a lesson.” The
smile took on a roguish cast. “My Aunt Resara said you paid the price and enjoyed it.”
Min could only shake her head. It was as if Leane had become a different woman. Talking that
way about . . . ! Even hearing it, she could hardly believe. Come to that, Leane actually looked
different. For all of the work with brushes, there was not a hint of paint or powder on her face that
Min could see, yet her lips seemed fuller, her cheekbones higher, her eyes larger. She was a more
than pretty woman at any time, but now her beauty was magnified fivefold.
Siuan was not quite finished, though. “And if this country lord is one like Logain?” she said
softly. “What will you do then?”
Leane drew herself up stiff-backed on her knees and swallowed hard before answering, but her
voice was perfectly level. “Given the alternatives, what choice would you make?”
Neither blinked, and the silence stretched.
Before Siuan could answer—if she meant to; Min would have given a pretty to hear it—the
chain and lock rattled on the other side of the door.
The other two women got slowly to their feet, gathering their saddlebags in calm preparation,
but Min leaped up wishing she had her belt knife. Fool thing to wish for, she thought. Just get me in
worse trouble. I’m no bloody hero in a story. Even if I jumped the guard—
The door opened, and a man with a long leather jerkin over his shirt filled the doorway. Not a
fellow to be attacked by a young woman, even with a knife. Maybe not even with an axe. Wide was
the word for him, and thick. The few hairs remaining on his head were more white than not, but he
looked hard as an old oak stump. “Time for you girls to stand before the lord,” he said gruffly. “Will
you walk, or must we haul you like grain sacks? You go, either way, but I’d as soon not have to carry
you in this heat.”
Peeking past him, Min saw two more men waiting, gray-haired but just as hard, if not quite so
big.
“We will walk,” Siuan told him dryly.
“Good. Come, then. Step along. Lord Gareth won’t like being kept waiting.”
Promise to walk or no, each man took one of them firmly by the arm as they started up the dusty
dirt street. The balding man’s hand encircled Min’s arm like a manacle. So much for running for it,
she thought bitterly. She considered kicking his booted ankle to see if that would loosen his grip, but
he looked so solid she suspected all it would earn her was a sore toe and being dragged the rest of the
way.
Leane appeared lost in thought; she half-made small gestures with her free hand, and her lips
moved silently as though reviewing what she meant to say, but she kept shaking her head and starting
over again. Introspection wrapped Siuan, too, but she wore an openly worried frown, even chewing
her underlip; Siuan never showed that much unease. All in all, the pair of them did nothing for Min’s
confidence.
The beam-ceilinged common room of the Good Queen’s Justice did less. Lank-haired Admer
Nem, a yellowed bruise around his swollen eye, stood to one side with half a dozen equally stout

brothers and cousins and their wives, all in their best coats or aprons. The farmers eyed the three
prisoners with a mixture of anger and satisfaction that made Min’s stomach sink. If anything, the
farmwives’ glares were worse, pure hate. The rest of the walls were lined six deep with villagers,
all garbed for the work they had interrupted for this. The blacksmith still wore his leather apron, and
a number of women had sleeves rolled up, arms dusted with flour. The room buzzed with their
murmuring among themselves, the elders as much as the few children, and their eyes latched onto the
three women as avidly as the Nems’ did. Min thought this must be as much excitement as Kore
Springs had ever witnessed. She had seen a crowd with this mood once—at an execution.
The tables had been removed, except for one placed in front of the long brick fireplace. A blufffaced, stocky man, his hair thick with gray, sat facing them in a well-cut coat of dark green silk, hands
folded in front of him on the tabletop. A slim woman who showed as much age stood beside the table
in a fine, gray wool dress embroidered with white flowers around the neck. The local lord, Min
supposed, and his lady; country nobility little better informed of the world than their tenants and
crofters.
The guards situated them in front of the lord’s table and melted into the watchers. The woman in
gray stepped forward, and the murmurs died.
“All here attend and give ear,” the woman announced, “for justice will be meted today by Lord
Gareth Bryne. Prisoners, you are called before the judgment of Lord Bryne.” Not the lord’s lady, then;
an official of some sort. Gareth Bryne? The last Min remembered, he was Captain-General of the
Queen’s Guards, in Caemlyn. If it was the same man. She glanced at Siuan, but Siuan had her eyes
locked on the wide floorboards in front of her feet. Whoever he was, this Bryne looked weary.
“You are charged,” the woman in gray went on, “with trespass by night, arson and destruction of
a building and its contents, the killing of valuable livestock, assault on the person of Admer Nem, and
the theft of a purse said to contain gold and silver. It is understood that the assault and theft were the
work of your companion, who escaped, but you three are equally culpable under the law.”
She paused to let it sink in, and Min exchanged rueful glances with Leane. Logainwould have to
add theft to the stew. He was probably halfway to Murandy by now, if not more distant yet.
After a moment the woman began again. “Your accusers are here to face you.” She gestured to
the cluster of Nems. “Admer Nem, you will give your testimony.”
The stout man eased forward in a blend of self-importance and self-consciousness, tugging at his
coat where the wooden buttons strained over his middle, running his hands through thinning hair that
kept dropping into his face. “Like I said, Lord Gareth, it was like this. . . .”
He gave a fairly straightforward account of discovering them in the hayloft and ordering them
out, though he made Logain near a foot taller and turned the man’s single blow into a fight where Nem
gave as good as he got. The lantern fell, the hay went up, and the rest of the family came spilling out
of the farmhouse into the predawn; the prisoners were seized and the barn burned to the ground, and
then the loss of the purse from the house was discovered. He did slight the part where Lord Bryne’s
retainer rode by as some of the family were bringing out ropes and eyeing tree limbs.
When he started on the “fight” again—this time he seemed to be winning—Bryne cut him off.
“That will be enough, Master Nem. You may step back.”
Instead, a round-faced one of the Nem women, of an age to be Admer’s wife, joined him. Roundfaced, but not soft; round like a frying pan or a river rock. And flushed with something more than
anger. “You whip these hussies good, Lord Gareth, hear? Whip them good, and ride them to Jornhill
on a rail!”
“No one called on you to speak, Maigan,” the slim woman in gray said sharply. “This is a trial,

not a petition meeting. You and Admer step back. Now.” They obeyed, Admer with a shade more
alacrity than Maigan. The gray-clad woman turned to Min and her companions. “If you wish to offer
testimony, in defense or mitigation, you may now give it.” There was no sympathy in her voice, nor
anything else for that matter.
Min expected Siuan to speak—she always took the lead, did the talking—but Siuan never stirred
or raised her eyes. Instead, it was Leane who moved toward the table, her eyes on the man behind it.
She stood as straight as ever, but her usual walk—a graceful stride, but a stride—had become a
sort of glide, with just a hint of willowy sway to it. Somehow her hips and bosom seemed more
obvious. Not that she flaunted anything; the way she moved just made you aware. “My Lord, we are
three helpless women, refugees from the storms that sweep the world.” Her usually brisk tones were
gone, changed to a velvety soft caress. There was a light in her dark eyes, a sort of smoldering
challenge. “Penniless and lost, we took shelter in Master Nem’s barn. It was wrong, I know, but we
were afraid of the night.” A small gesture, hands half-raised, the insides of her wrists to Bryne, made
her seem for a moment utterly helpless. Only for that moment, though. “The man Dalyn was a stranger
to us really, a man who offered us his protection. In these days, women alone must have a protector,
my Lord, yet I fear we made a poor choice.” A widening of the eyes, an entreating look, said he could
make a better for them. “It was indeed he who attacked Master Nem, my Lord; we would have fled,
or worked to repay our night’s lodging.” Stepping around the side of the table, she knelt gracefully
beside Bryne’s chair and gently rested the fingers of one hand on his wrist as she gazed up into his
eyes. A tremble touched her voice, but her slight smile was enough to set any man’s heart racing. It—
suggested. “My Lord, we are guilty of some small crime, yet not so much as we are charged with. We
throw ourselves on your mercy. I beg you, my Lord, have pity on us, and protect us.”
For a long moment, Bryne stared back into her eyes. Then, clearing his throat roughly, he
scraped back his chair, rose, and walked around the opposite end of the table from her. There was a
stir among the villagers and farmers, men clearing their throats as their lord had done, women
muttering under their breath. Bryne stopped in front of Min. “What is your name, girl?”
“Min, my Lord.” She caught a muffled grunt from Siuan and hastily added, “Serenla Min.
Everyone calls me Serenla, my Lord.”
“Your mother must have had a premonition,” he murmured with a smile. He was not the first to
react to the name in a like way. “Do you have any statement to make, Serenla?”
“Only that I am very sorry, my Lord, and it really wasn’t our fault. Dalyn did it all. I ask for
mercy, my Lord.” That did not seem much alongside Leane’s plea—anything at all would seem
insignificant beside Leane’s performance—but it was the best she could find. Her mouth was as dry
as the street outside. What if he did decide to hang them?
Nodding, he moved over to Siuan, who was still studying the floor. Cupping a hand under her
chin, he raised her eyes to his. “And what is your name, girl?”
With a jerk of her head, Siuan pulled her chin free and took a step back. “Mara, my Lord,” she
whispered. “Mara Tomanes.”
Min groaned softly. Siuan was plainly frightened, yet at the same time she stared at the man
defiantly. Min more than half-expected her to demand Bryne let them walk away on the instant. He
asked her if she wished to make a statement, and she denied it in another unsteady whisper, but all the
while looking at him as though she were the one in charge. She might be controlling her tongue, but
certainly not her eyes.
After a time, Bryne turned away. “Take your place with your friends, girl,” he told Leane as he
returned to his chair. She joined them with a look of open frustration, and what in anyone else Min

would have called a touch of petulance.
“I have reached my decision,” Bryne said to the room at large. “The crimes are serious, and
nothing I have heard alters the facts. If three men sneak into another’s house to steal his candlesticks
and one of them attacks the owner, all three are equally guilty. There must be recompense. Master
Nem, I will give you the cost of rebuilding your barn, plus the price of six milkcows.” The stout
farmer’s eyes brightened, until Bryne added, “Caralin will disburse the coin to you when she is
content as to costs and prices. Some of your cows were going dry, I hear.” The slim woman in gray
nodded in satisfaction. “For the bump on your head, I award you one silver mark. Don’t complain,”
he said firmly as Nem opened his mouth. “Maigan has given you worse for drinking too much.” A
ripple of laughter among the onlookers greeted that, not diminished at all by Nem’s half-abashed
glares, and perhaps spurred by the tightlipped look Maigan gave her husband. “I will also replace the
amount of the stolen purse. Once Caralin has satisfied herself as to how much was in it.” Nem and his
wife appeared equally disgruntled, but they held their tongues; it was plain he had given them what he
would. Min began to feel hope.
Leaning his elbows on the table, Bryne turned his attention to her and the other two. His slow
words tied her stomach into a knot. “You three will work for me, at the normal wages for whatever
tasks you are given, until the coin I’ve paid out is repaid to me. Do not think I am being lenient. If you
swear an oath that satisfies me you don’t have to be guarded, you can work in my manor. If not, it
means the fields, where you can be under someone’s eyes every minute. Wages are lower in the
fields, but it is your decision.”
Frantically she racked her brain for the weakest oath that might satisfy. She did not like breaking
her word in any circumstances, but she meant to be gone as soon as a chance presented, and she did
not want too heavy an oathbreaking on her conscience.
Leane seemed to be searching, too, but Siuan barely hesitated before kneeling and folding her
hands over her heart. Her eyes seemed fastened to Bryne’s, and the challenge had not faded one bit.
“By the Light and my hope of salvation and rebirth, I swear to serve you in whatever way you require
for as long as you require, or may the Creator’s face turn from me forever and darkness consume my
soul.” She delivered the words in a breathy whisper, but they created a dead silence. There was no
oath stronger, unless it was the one a woman took on being made Aes Sedai, and the Oath Rod bound
her to that as surely as to a part of her flesh.
Leane stared at Siuan; then she was on her knees, too. “By the Light and my hope of salvation
and rebirth . . .”
Min floundered desperately, searching for some way out. Swearing a lesser oath than they did
meant the fields for certain, and someone watching her every instant, but this oath. . . . By what she
had been taught, breaking it would be not much less than murder, maybe no less. Only there was no
way out. The oath, or who knew how many years laboring in a field all day and probably locked up at
night. Sinking down beside the other two women, she muttered the words, but inside she was
howling. Siuan, you utter fool! What have you gotten me into now? I can’t stay here! I have to go
to Rand! Oh, Light, help me!
“Well,” Bryne breathed when the last word was spoken, “I did not expect that. But it does
suffice. Caralin, would you take Master Nem somewhere and find out what he thinks his losses
amount to? And clear everyone else but these three out of here, too. And make arrangements to
transport them to the manor. Under the circumstances, I don’t think guards will be necessary.”
The slim woman gave him a harassed look, but in short order she had everyone moving out in a
milling throng. Admer Nem and his male kin stuck close to her, his face especially painted with

avarice. The Nem women looked scarcely less greedy, but they still spared a few hard glowers for
Min and the other two, who remained kneeling as the room emptied out. For herself, Min did not
believe her legs could hold her up. The same phrases repeated over and over in her mind. Oh, Siuan,
why? I can’t stay here. I can’t!
“We have had a few refugees through here,” Bryne said when the last of the villagers had gone.
He leaned back in his chair, studying them. “But never as odd a threesome as you. A Domani. A
Tairen?” Siuan nodded curtly. She and Leane stood up, the slender, coppery-skinned woman
delicately brushing her knees, Siuan simply standing. Min managed to join them, on wobbly legs.
“And you, Serenla.” Once more he gave the ghost of a smile at the name. “Somewhere in the west of
Andor, unless I mistake your accent.”
“Baerlon,” she muttered, then bit her tongue too late. Someone might know Min was from
Baerlon.
“I’ve heard of nothing in the west to make refugees,” he said in a questioning tone. When she
remained silent, he did not press it. “After you have worked off your debt, you will be welcome to
remain in my service. Life can be hard for those who’ve lost their homes, and even a maid’s cot is
better than sleeping under a bush.”
“Thank you, my Lord,” Leane said caressingly, making a curtsy so graceful that even in her rough
riding dress it looked part of a dance. Min’s echo was leaden, and she did not trust her knees for a
curtsy. Siuan simply stood there staring at him and said nothing at all.
“A pity your companion took your horses. Four horses would reduce your debt by some.”
“He was a stranger, and a rogue,” Leane told him, in a voice suitable for something far more
intimate. “I for one am more than happy to exchange his protection for yours, my Lord.”
Bryne eyed her—appreciatively, Min thought—but all he said was “At least you will be safely
away from the Nems at the manor.”
There was no reply for that. Min supposed scrubbing floors in Bryne’s manor would not be
much different from scrubbing floors in the Nem farmhouse. How do I get out of this? Light, how?
The silence went on, except for Bryne drumming his fingers on the table. Min would have
thought he was at a loss for what to say next, but she did not think this man was ever off balance.
More likely he was irritated that only Leane appeared to be showing any gratitude; she supposed their
sentence could have been much worse, from his point of view. Perhaps Leane’s heated glances and
stroking tones had worked after a fashion, but Min found herself wishing the woman had remained the
way she was. Being hung up by the wrists in the village square would be better than this.
Finally Caralin returned, muttering to herself. She sounded prickly, reporting to Bryne. “It will
take days to get straight answers from those Nems, Lord Gareth. Admer would have five new barns
and fifty cows, if I let him. At least I believe there really was a purse, but as to how much was in it
. . .” She shook her head and sighed. “I will find out, eventually. Joni is ready to take these girls to the
manor, if you are done with them.”
“Take them away, Caralin,” Bryne said, rising. “When you’ve sent them off, join me at the
brickyard.” He sounded weary again. “Thad Haren says he needs more water if he’s to keep making
bricks, and the Light alone knows where I will find it for him.” He strode out of the common room as
if he had forgotten all about the three women who had just sworn to serve him.
Joni turned out to be the wide, balding man who had come for them in the shed, waiting now in
front of the inn beside a high-wheeled cart enclosed by a round canvas cover, with a lean brown
horse in the shafts. A few of the villagers stood about to watch their departure, but most seemed to
have gone back to their homes and out of the heat. Gareth Bryne was already far down the dirt street.

“Joni will see you safely to the manor,” Caralin said. “Do as you are told, and you will not find
the life hard.” For a moment she considered them, dark eyes nearly as sharp as Siuan’s; then she
nodded to herself as if satisfied and hurried off after Bryne.
Joni held the curtains open for them at the back of the cart, but let them clamber up unaided and
find places to sit on the cart bed. There was not so much as a handful of straw for padding, and the
heavy covering trapped the heat. He said not a word. The cart rocked as he climbed up on the
driver’s seat, hidden by the canvas. Min heard him cluck to the horse, and the cart lurched off, wheels
creaking slightly, bumping over occasional potholes.
There was just enough of a crack in the covering at the back for Min to watch the village
dwindle behind them and vanish, replaced alternately by long thickets and rail-fenced fields. She felt
too stunned to speak. Siuan’s grand cause was to end scrubbing pots and floors. She should never
have helped the woman, never stayed with her. She should have ridden for Tear at the first
opportunity.
“Well,” Leane said suddenly, “that worked out not badly at all.” She was back to her usual brisk
voice again, but there was a flush of excitement—excitement!—in it, and a high color in her cheeks.
“It could have been better, but practice will take care of that.” Her low laugh was almost a giggle. “I
never realized how much fun it would be. When I actually felt his pulse racing . . .” For a moment she
held out her hand the way she had placed it on Bryne’s wrist. “I don’t think I ever felt so alive, so
aware. Aunt Resara used to say men were better sport than hawks, but I never really understood until
today.”
Holding herself against the sway of the cart, Min goggled at her. “You have gone mad,” she said
finally. “How many years have we sworn away? Two? Five? I suppose you hope Gareth Bryne will
spend them dandling you on his knee! Well, I hope he turns you over it. Every day!” The startled look
on Leane’s face did nothing for Min’s temper. Did she expect Min to take it as calmly as she
appeared to? But it was not Leane that Min was really angry with. She twisted around to glare at
Siuan. “And you! When you decide to give up, you don’t do it small. You just surrender like a lamb at
slaughter. Why did you choose that oath? Light, why?”
“Because,” Siuan replied, “it was the one oath I could be sure would keep him from setting
people to watch us night and day, manor house or not.” Lying half stretched out on the rough planks of
the cart, she made it sound the most obvious thing in the world. And Leane appeared to agree with
her.
“You mean to break it,” Min said after a moment. It came out in a shocked whisper, but even so
she glanced worriedly at the canvas curtains that hid Joni. She did not think he could have heard.
“I mean to do what I must,” Siuan said firmly, but just as softly. “In two or three days, when I
can be sure they really aren’t watching us especially, we will leave. I fear we must take horses, since
ours are gone. Bryne must have good stables. I will regret that.” And Leane just sat there like a cat
with cream on her whiskers. She must have realized from the first; that was why she had not hesitated
in swearing.
“You will regret stealing horses?” Min said hoarsely. “You plan to break an oath anyone but a
Darkfriend would keep, and you regret stealing horses? I can’t believe either of you. I don’t know
either of you.”
“Do you really mean to stay and scrub pots,” Leane asked, her voice just as low as theirs, “when
Rand is out there with your heart in his pocket?”
Min glowered silently. She wished they had never learned she was in love with Rand al’Thor.
Sometimes she wished she had never learned it. A man who barely knew she was alive, a man like

that. What he was no longer seemed as important as the fact that he had never looked at her twice, but
it was all of a piece, really. She wanted to say she would keep her oath, forget about Rand for
however long it took her to work off her debt. Only, she could not open her mouth. Burn him! If I’d
never met him, I wouldn’t be in this pickle!
When the silence between them had gone on far too long for Min’s liking, broken only by the
rhythmic creak of the wheels and the soft thud of the horse’s hooves, Siuan spoke. “I mean to do as I
swore to do. When I have finished what I must do first. I did not swear to serve him immediately; I
was careful not to even imply it, strictly speaking. A fine point, I know, and one Gareth Bryne might
not appreciate, but true all the same.”
Min sagged in amazement, letting herself lurch with the cart’s slow motion. “You intend to run
away, then come back in a few years and hand yourselves over to Bryne? The man will sell your
hides to a tannery. Our hides.” Not until she said that did she realize she had accepted Siuan’s
solution. Run away, then come back and . . . I can’t! I love Rand. And he wouldn’t notice if Gareth
Bryne made me work in his kitchens the rest of my life!
“Not a man to cross, I agree,” Siuan sighed. “I met him once—before. I was terrified he might
recognize my voice today. Faces may change, but voices don’t.” She touched her own face
wonderingly, as she sometimes did, apparently unaware of doing so. “Faces do change,” she
murmured. Then her tone firmed. “I’ve paid heavy prices already for what I had to do, and I will pay
this one. Eventually. If you must drown or ride a lionfish, you ride and hope for the best. That is all
there is to it, Serenla.”
“Being a servant is far from the future I would choose,” Leane said, “but it is in the future, and
who knows what may happen before? I can remember too well when I thought I had no future.” A
small smile appeared on her lips, her eyes half-closed dreamily, and her voice became velvet.
“Besides, I don’t think he will sell our hides at all. Give me a few years of practice, and then a few
minutes with Lord Gareth Bryne, and he will greet us with open arms and put us up in his best rooms.
He’ll deck us with silks, and offer his carriage to carry us wherever we want to go.”
Min left her wrapped in her fantasy. Sometimes she thought the other two both lived in
dreamworlds. Something else occurred to her. A small thing, but it was beginning to irritate. “Ah,
Mara, tell me something. I’ve noticed some people smile when you call me by name. Serenla. Bryne
did, and he said something about my mother having a premonition. Why?”
“In the Old Tongue,” Siuan replied, “it means ‘stubborn daughter.’ You did have a stubborn
streak when we first met. A mile wide and a mile deep.” Siuan said that! Siuan, the most stubborn
woman in the whole world! Her smile was as wide as her face. “Of course, you do seem to be
coming along. At the next village, you might use Chalinda. That means ‘sweet girl.’ Or maybe—”
Suddenly the cart gave a harder lurch than any before, then picked up speed as if the horse were
reaching for a gallop. Bumping around like grain on a chaffing sieve, the three women stared at one
another in surprise. Then Siuan levered herself up and pulled aside the canvas hiding the driver’s
seat. Joni was gone. Throwing herself across the wooden seat, Siuan grabbed the reins and reared
back, hauling the horse to a halt. Min threw open the back curtains, searching.
The road ran through a thicket here, nearly a small forest of oak and elm, pine and leatherleaf.
The dust of their short dash was still settling, some of it on Joni, where he lay sprawled by the side of
the hard-packed dirt road sixty or so paces back.
Instinctively Min leaped down and ran back to kneel beside the big man. He was still breathing,
but his eyes were closed and a bloody gash on the side of his head was coming up in a purple lump.
Leane pushed her aside and felt Joni’s head with sure fingers. “He will live,” she said crisply.

“Nothing seems broken, but he will have a headache for days after he wakes.” Sitting back on her
heels, she folded her hands, and her voice saddened. “There is nothing I can do for him in any case.
Burn me, I promised myself I would not cry over it again.”
“The question—” Min swallowed and started again. “The question is, do we load him in the
back of the cart and take him on to the manor, or do we—go?” Light, I’m no better than Siuan!
“We could carry him as far as the next farm,” Leane said slowly.
Siuan came up to them, leading the cart horse as if afraid the placid animal might bite. One
glance at the man on the ground, and she frowned. “He never had that falling off the cart. I don’t see
root or rock here to cause it.” She started studying the wood around them, and a man rode out of the
trees on a tall black stallion, leading three mares, one shaggy and two hands shorter than the others.
He was a tall man in a blue silk coat, with a sword at his side, his hair curling to broad
shoulders, darkly handsome despite a hardening as though misfortune had marked him deeply. And he
was the last man Min expected to see.
“Is this your work?” Siuan demanded of him.
Logain smiled as he reined in beside the cart, though there was little amusement in it. “A sling is
a useful thing, Mara. You are lucky I am here. I didn’t expect you to leave the village for some hours
yet, and barely able to walk then. The local lord was indulgent, it seems.” Abruptly his face went
even darker, and his voice was rough stone. “Did you think I would leave you to your fate? Maybe I
should have. You made promises to me, Mara. I want the revenge you promised. I’ve followed you
halfway to the Sea of Storms on this search, though you won’t tell me what for. I’ve asked no
questions as to how you plan to give me what you promised. But I will tell you this now. Your time is
growing short. End your search soon, and deliver your promises, or I will leave you to find your own
way. You’ll quickly find most villages offer small sympathy to penniless strangers. Three pretty
women alone? The sight of this,” he touched the sword at his hip, “has kept you safe more times than
you can know. Find what you are seeking soon, Mara.”
He had not been so arrogant at the beginning of their journey. Then he had been humbly thankful
for their help—as humbly as a man like Logain could manage, anyway. It seemed that time—and a
lack of results—had withered his gratitude.
Siuan did not flinch away from his stare. “I hope to,” she said firmly. “But if you want to go, then
leave our horses and go! If you won’t row, get out of the boat and swim by yourself! See how far you
get with your revenge alone.”
Logain’s big hands tightened on his reins until Min heard his knuckles crack. He shivered with
emotions in strong check. “I will stay a while longer, Mara,” he said finally. “A little while longer.”
For an instant, to Min’s eyes, a halo flared around his head, a radiant crown of gold and blue.
Siuan and Leane saw nothing, of course, though they knew what she could do. Sometimes she saw
things about people—viewings, she called them—images or auras. Sometimes she knew what they
meant. That woman would marry. That man would die. Small matters or grand events, joyous or
bleak, there was never any rhyme or reason to who or where or when. Aes Sedai and Warders
always had auras; most people never did. It was not always pleasant, knowing.
She had seen Logain’s halo before, and she knew what it meant. Glory to come. But for him,
perhaps above all men, surely that made no sense at all. His horse and his sword and his coat had
come from playing at dice, though Min was not certain how fair the games had been. He had nothing
else, and no prospects except Siuan’s promises, and how could Siuan ever keep them? His very name
was likely a death sentence. It just made no sense.
Logain’s humor returned as suddenly as it had gone. Pulling a fat, roughly woven purse from his

belt, he jangled it at them. “I’ve come by a few coins. We won’t have to sleep in another barn for a
while.”
“We heard of it,” Siuan said dryly. “I suppose I should have expected no better from you.”
“Think of it as a contribution to your search.” She stretched out her hand, but he tied the purse
back to his belt with a faintly mocking grin. “I would not want to taint your hand with stolen coin,
Mara. Besides, this way perhaps I can be sure you won’t run off and leave me.” Siuan looked as if
she could have bitten a nail in two, but she said nothing. Standing in his stirrups, Logain peered down
the road toward Kore Springs. “I see a flock of sheep coming this way, and a pair of boys. Time for
us to ride. They’ll carry word of this as fast as they can run.” Settling back down, he glanced at Joni,
still lying there unconscious. “And they’ll fetch help for that fellow. I don’t think I hit him hard enough
to hurt him badly.”
Min shook her head; the man continually surprised her. She would not have thought he would
spare a second thought for a man whose head he had just cracked.
Siuan and Leane wasted no time scrambling into their high-cantled saddles, Leane onto the gray
mare she called Moonflower, Siuan onto Bela, the short, shaggy mare. It was more of a scramble for
Siuan. She was no horsewoman; after weeks in the saddle she still treated sedate Bela like a fieryeyed warhorse. Leane handled Moonflower with effortless ease. Min knew she was somewhere in
between; she climbed onto Wildrose, her bay, with considerably more grace than Siuan, considerably
less than Leane.
“Do you think he will come after us?” Min asked as they started south, away from Kore Springs,
at a trot. She meant the question for Siuan, but it was Logain who answered.
“The local lord? I doubt he thinks you important enough. Of course, he may send a man, and he’ll
certainly spread your descriptions. We will ride as far as we can manage before stopping, and again
tomorrow.” It seemed he was taking charge.
“We aren’t important enough,” Siuan said, bouncing awkwardly in her saddle. She might have
been wary of Bela, but the look she directed at Logain’s back said his challenge to her authority
would not last long.
For herself, Min hoped Bryne considered them unimportant. He probably did. As long as he
never learned their real names. Logain quickened the stallion’s pace, and she heeled Wildrose to
keep up, putting her thoughts ahead, not behind.
Tucking his leather gauntlets behind his sword belt, Gareth Bryne picked up the curl-brimmed
velvet hat from his writing table. The hat was the latest fashion from Caemlyn. Caralin had seen to
that; he had no care for fashion, but she thought he should dress suitably for his position, and it was
the silks and velvets she laid out for him in the mornings.
As he set the high-crowned hat on his head, he caught sight of his shadowy reflection in one of
the study windows. Fitting that it was so wavery and thin. Squint as much as he would, his gray hat
and gray silk coat, embroidered with silver scrolls down the sleeves and collar, looked nothing like
the helmet and armor he was used to. That was over and done. And this . . . This was something to fill
empty hours. That was all.
“Are you certain you want to do this, Lord Gareth?”
He turned from the window to where Caralin stood beside her own writing table, across the
room from his. Hers was piled with the estate account books. She had run his estates all the years he
had been gone, and without doubt she still made a better job of it than he did.
“If you had set them to work for Admer Nem, as the law required,” she went on, “this would be

none of your affair at all.”
“But I did not,” he told her. “And would not if I had it to do again. You know as well as I do,
Nem and his male kin would be trying to corner those girls day and night. And Maigan and the rest of
the women would make their lives the Pit of Doom, that is if all three girls didn’t accidentally fall
down a well and drown.”
“Even Maigan would not use a well,” Caralin said dryly, “not with the weather we’ve been
having. Still, I take your point, Lord Gareth. But they have had most of a day and a night to run in any
direction. You will locate them as soon by sending out word of them. If they can be found.”
“Thad can find them.” Thad was over seventy, but he could still track yesterday’s wind across
stone by moonlight, and he had been more than happy to turn the brickyard over to his son.
“If you say so, Lord Gareth.” She and Thad did not get on. “Well, when you bring them back, I
can certainly use them in the house.”
Something in her voice, casual as it was, pricked his attention. A touch of satisfaction.
Practically from the day he arrived home Caralin had introduced a succession of pretty maids and
farmgirls into the manor house, all willing and eager to help the lord forget his miseries. “They are
oathbreakers, Caralin. I fear it’s the fields for them.”
A brief, exasperated tightening of her lips confirmed his suspicions, but she kept her tone
indifferent. “The other two perhaps, Lord Gareth, but the Domani girl’s grace would be wasted in the
fields, and would suit serving at table very well. A remarkably pretty young woman. Still, it will be
as you wish, of course.”
So that was the one Caralin had picked out. A remarkably pretty young woman indeed. Though
oddly different from the Domani women he had met. A touch hesitant here, a touch too fast there.
Almost as if she were just now trying out her arts for the first time. That was impossible, of course.
Domani women trained their daughters to twine men around their fingers almost from the cradle. Not
that she had been ineffective, he admitted. If Caralin had sprung her on him among the farmgirls . . .
Remarkably pretty.
So why was it not her face that kept filling his mind? Why did he find himself thinking of a pair
of blue eyes? Challenging him as though wishing she had a sword, afraid and refusing to yield to fear.
Mara Tomanes. He had been sure she was one to keep her word, even without oaths. “I will bring her
back,” he muttered to himself. “I will know why she broke oath.”
“As you say, my Lord,” Caralin said. “I thought she might do for your bedchamber maid. Sela is
getting a bit old to be running up and down the stairs to fetch for you at night.”
Bryne blinked at her. What? Oh. The Domani girl. He shook his head at Caralin’s foolishness.
But was he being any less foolish? He was the lord here; he should remain here to take care of his
people. Yet Caralin had taken better care than he knew how, all the years he was gone. He knew
camps and soldiers and campaigns, and maybe a bit of how to maneuver in court intrigues. She was
right. He should take off his sword and this fool hat, and have Caralin write out their descriptions,
and . . .
Instead, he said, “Keep a close eye on Admer Nem and his kin. They’ll try to cheat you as much
as they can.”
“As you say, my Lord.” The words were perfectly respectful; the tone told him to go teach his
grandfather to shear sheep. Chuckling to himself, he went outside.
The manor house was really little more than a tremendously overgrown farmhouse, two rambling
stories of brick and stone under a slate roof, added to again and again by generations of Brynes.
House Bryne had owned this land—or it had owned them—since Andor was wrought from the

wreckage of Artur Hawkwing’s empire a thousand years before, and for all that time it had sent its
sons off to fight Andor’s wars. He would fight no more wars, but it was too late for House Bryne.
There had been too many wars, too many battles. He was the last of the blood. No wife, no son, no
daughter. The line ended with him. All things had to end; the Wheel of Time turned.
Twenty men waited beside saddled horses on the stone-paved yard in front of the manor house.
Men even grayer than he, mostly, if they had hair. Experienced soldiers all, former squadmen,
squadron leaders and bannermen who had served with him at one time or another in his career. Joni
Shagrin, who had been Senior Bannerman of the Guards, was right at the front with a bandage around
his temples, though Bryne knew for a fact his daughters had set their children to keep him in his bed.
He was one of the few who had any family, here or anywhere else. Most had chosen to come serve
Gareth Bryne again rather than drink away their pensions over reminiscences no one but another old
soldier wanted to hear.
All wore swords belted over their coats, and a few carried long, steel-tipped lances that had
hung for years on a wall until this morning. Every saddle had a fat blanket roll behind, and bulging
saddlebags, plus a pot or kettle and full water bags, just as if they were riding out on campaign
instead of a week’s jaunt to chase down three women who set fire to a barn. Here was a chance to
relive old days, or pretend to.
He wondered if that was what was rousting him out. He was certainly too old to go riding off
after a set of pretty eyes on a woman young enough to be his daughter. Maybe his granddaughter. I am
not that big a fool, he told himself firmly. Caralin could manage things better with him not getting in
the way.
A lanky bay gelding came galloping up the oak lane that led down to the road, and the rider
threw himself out of the saddle before the animal came to a full stop; the man half-stumbled but still
managed to put fist to heart in a proper salute. Barim Halle, who served under him as a senior
squadman years ago, was hard and wiry, with a leather egg for a head and white eyebrows that
seemed to be trying to make up for the lack of other hair. “You been recalled to Caemlyn, my CaptainGeneral?” he panted.
“No,” Bryne said, too sharply. “What do you mean riding in here as though you had Cairhienin
cavalry on your tail?” Some of the other horses were frisking, catching the bay’s mood.
“Never rode that hard unless we was chasing them, my Lord.” Barim’s grin faded when the man
saw he was not laughing. “Well, my Lord, I seen the horses, and I reckoned—” The man took another
look at his face and cut off that line. “Well, actually, I got some news, too. I been over to New Braem
to see my sister, and I heard plenty.”
New Braem was older than Andor—“old” Braem had been destroyed in the Trolloc Wars, a
thousand years before Artur Hawkwing—and it was a good place for news. A middling-sized border
town well to the east of his estates, on the road from Caemlyn to Tar Valon. Even with Morgase’s
current attitude, the merchants would keep that road busy. “Well, out with it, man. If there’s news,
what is it?”
“Uh, just trying to figure where to start, my Lord.” Barim straightened unconsciously, as though
making a report. “Most important, I reckon, they say Tear has fallen. Aielmen took the Stone itself,
and the Sword That Cannot Be Touched has flat been touched. Somebody drew it, they say.”
“An Aielman drew it?” Bryne said incredulously. An Aiel would die before he touched a sword;
he had seen it happen, in the Aiel War. Though it was said Callandor was not really a sword at all.
Whatever that meant.
“They didn’t say, my Lord. I heard names; Ren somebody or other most often. But they was

talking it like fact, not rumor. Like everybody knew.”
Bryne’s forehead creased in a frown. Worse than troubling, if true. If Callandor had been
drawn, then the Dragon was Reborn. According to the Prophecies, that meant the Last Battle was
coming, the Dark One breaking free. The Dragon Reborn would save the world, so the Prophecies
said. And destroy it. This was news enough by itself to have set Halle galloping, if he had thought
twice.
But the leathery fellow was not finished. “Word come down from Tar Valon is near as big, my
Lord. They say there’s a new Amyrlin Seat. Elaida, my Lord, who was the Queen’s advisor.”
Blinking suddenly, Halle hurried on; Morgase was forbidden ground, and every man on the estate
knew it, though Bryne had never said so. “They say the old Amyrlin, Siuan Sanche, was stilled and
executed. And Logain died, too. That false Dragon they caught and gentled last year. They talked it
like it was true, my Lord. Some of them claimed they was in Tar Valon when it all happened.”
Logain was no great news, even if he had started a war in Ghealdan by claiming to be the
Dragon Reborn. There had been several false Dragons the last few years. He could channel, though;
that was a fact. Until the Aes Sedai gentled him. Well, he was not the first man to be caught and
gentled, cut off from the Power so he could never channel again. They said men like that, whether
false Dragons or just poor fools the Red Ajah took against, never lived long. It was said they gave up
wanting to live.
Siuan Sanche, though, that was news. He had met her once, nearly three years ago. A woman
who demanded obedience and gave no reasons. Tough as an old boot, with a tongue like a file and a
temper like that of a bear with a sore tooth. He would have expected her to tear any upstart claimant
limb from limb with her bare hands. Stilling was the same as gentling for a man, but more rare by far.
Especially for an Amyrlin Seat. Only two Amyrlins in three thousand years had suffered that fate, so
far as the Tower admitted, though it was possible they could have hidden two dozen more; the Tower
was very good at hiding what they wanted hidden. But an execution on top of stilling seemed
unnecessary. It was said women survived stilling no better than men did gentling.
It all stank of trouble. Everyone knew the Tower had secret alliances, strings tied to thrones and
powerful lords and ladies. With a new Amyrlin raised in this fashion, some would surely try to test
whether the Aes Sedai still watched as closely. And once this fellow in Tear quelled any opposition
—not that there was likely to be much if he really did have the Stone—he would move, against Illian
or Cairhien. The question was, how quickly could he move? Would forces be gathered against him, or
for him? He had to be the true Dragon Reborn, but the Houses would go both ways, and the people,
too. And if petty squabbles broke out because the Tower—
“Old fool,” he muttered. Seeing Barim give a start, he added, “Not you. Another old fool.” None
of this was his affair any longer. Except to decide which way House Bryne went, when the time came.
Not that anyone would care, except to know whether or not to attack him. Bryne had never been a
powerful House, or large.
“Uh, my Lord?” Barim glanced at the men waiting with their horses. “Do you think you might
need me, my Lord?”
Without even asking where or why. He was not the only one bored with country life. “Catch up
to us when you have your gear together. We’ll be heading south on the Four Kings Road to start.”
Barim saluted and dashed away, dragging his horse behind him.
Climbing into his saddle, Bryne swung his arm forward without a word, and the men fell into a
column of twos behind him as they headed down the oak lane. He meant to have answers. If he had to
take this Mara by the scruff of the neck and shake her, he would have answers.

The High Lady Alteima relaxed as the gates of the Royal Palace of Andor swung open and her
carriage rolled in. She had not been certain they would open. It had surely taken long enough to get a
note taken in, and longer still to have a reply. Her maid, a thin girl acquired here in Caemlyn, goggled
and all but bounced on the seat across from her at the excitement of actually entering the palace.
Snapping open her lace fan, Alteima tried to cool herself. It was still well short of midday; the
heat would grow worse yet. To think she had always thought of Andor as cool. Hastily she reviewed
what she meant to say one last time. She was a pretty woman—she knew exactly how pretty—with
large brown eyes that made some mistakenly think her innocent, even harmless. She knew she was
neither, but it suited her very well to have others believe her so. Especially here, today. This carriage
had taken almost the last of the gold she had managed to carry away when she fled Tear. If she was to
reestablish herself, she needed powerful friends, and there was none more powerful in Andor than the
woman she had come to see.
The carriage halted near a fountain in a column-ringed courtyard, and a servant in red-and-white
livery rushed to open the door. Alteima barely glanced at the courtyard or the serving man; her mind
was all on the meeting ahead. Black hair spilled to the middle of her back from beneath a close-fitting
cap of seed pearls, and more pearls lined the tiny pleats of her high-necked gown of watery green
silk. She had met Morgase once, briefly, five years ago during a state visit; a woman who radiated
power, as reserved and stately as one should expect of a queen, and also proper, in the Andoran way.
Which meant prim. The rumors in the city that she had a lover—a man not much liked, it seemed—did
not fit that very well, of course. But from what Alteima remembered, the formality of the gown—and
the high neck—should please Morgase.
As soon as Alteima’s slippers were firmly on the paving stones, the maid, Cara, leaped down
and began fussing over the fall of the pleats. Until Alteima snapped her fan shut and slapped the girl’s
wrist with it; a courtyard was no place for that. Cara—such a foolish name—flinched back, clutching
her wrist with a wounded look and the beginnings of tears.
Alteima compressed her lips in irritation. The girl did not even know how to take mild reproof.
She had been fooling herself: the girl would not do; she was too obviously untrained. But a lady had
to have a maid, especially if she was to differentiate herself from the mass of refugees in Andor. She
had seen men and women laboring in the sun, even begging in the streets, while wearing the remnants
of Cairhienin nobles’ garb. She thought she had recognized one or two. Perhaps she should take one
of them in service; who could know the duties of a lady’s maid better than a lady? And if they were
reduced to working with their hands, they should leap at the chance. It might be amusing to have a
former “friend” for a maid. Too late for today, though. And an untrained maid, a local girl, said a
little too clearly that Alteima was at the edge of her resources, only one step removed from those
beggars herself.
She put on a look of concerned gentleness. “Did I hurt you, Cara?” she said sweetly. “Remain
here in the carriage and soothe your wrist. I am certain someone will bring you cool water to drink.”
The mindless gratitude on the girl’s face was stupefying.
The liveried men, well trained, stood looking at nothing at all. Still, word of Alteima’s kindness
would spread, if she knew anything about servants.
A tall young man appeared before her in the white-collared red coat and burnished breastplate
of the Queen’s Guard, bowing with a hand to his sword hilt. “I am Guardsman-Lieutenant Tallanvor,
High Lady. If you will come with me, I will escort you to Queen Morgase.” He offered an arm, which
she took, but otherwise she was scarcely aware of him. She had no interest in soldiers unless generals

and lords.
As he attended her down broad corridors seemingly full of scurrying men and women in livery
—they took care not to impede her way, of course—she subtly examined the fine wall hangings, the
ivory-inlaid chests and highchests, the bowls and vases of chased gold or silver, or thin Sea Folk
porcelain. The Royal Palace did not display as much wealth as the Stone of Tear, but Andor was still
a wealthy land, perhaps even as wealthy as Tear. An older lord would do nicely, malleable for a
woman still young, perhaps a touch feeble and infirm. With vast estates. That would be a beginning,
while she found out exactly where the strings of power lay in Andor. A few words exchanged with
Morgase some years ago were not much of an introduction, but she had that which a powerful queen
must want and need. Information.
Finally Tallanvor ushered her into a large sitting room with a high ceiling painted in birds and
clouds and open sky, where ornately carved and gilded chairs stood before a polished white marble
fireplace. A part of Alteima’s mind noted with amusement that the wide red-and-gold carpet was
Tairen work. The young man went to one knee. “My Queen,” he said in a suddenly rough voice, “as
you have commanded, I bring you the High Lady Alteima, of Tear.”
Morgase waved him away. “You are welcome, Alteima. It is good to see you again. Sit, and we
will talk.”
Alteima managed a curtsy and murmured thanks before taking a chair. Envy curdled inside her.
She had remembered Morgase as a beautiful woman, but the golden-haired reality told her how pale
that memory had grown. Morgase was a rose in full bloom, ready to overshadow every other flower.
Alteima did not blame the young soldier for stumbling on his way out. She was just glad he was gone,
so she would not have to be aware of him looking at the two of them, comparing.
Yet, there were changes, too. Vast changes. Morgase, by the Grace of the Light, Queen of Andor,
Defender of the Realm, Protector of the People, High Seat of House Trakand, so very reserved and
stately and proper, wore a gown of shimmering white silk that showed enough bosom to shock a
tavern maid in the Maule. It clung to hip and thigh close enough to suit a Taraboner jade. The rumors
were clearly true. Morgase had a lover. And for her to have altered so much, it was equally clear that
she tried to please this Gaebril, not make him please her. Morgase still radiated power and a
presence that filled the room, but that dress transformed both to something less.
Alteima was doubly glad she had worn a high neck. A woman that deep in a man’s thrall could
lash out in a jealous rage on the smallest provocation or none at all. If she met Gaebril, she would
present him as near indifference as civility would allow. Even being suspected of thinking of
poaching Morgase’s lover could get her a hangman’s noose instead of a rich husband on his last legs.
She herself would have done the same.
A woman in red-and-white livery brought wine, an excellent Murandian, and poured it into
crystal goblets deeply engraved with the rearing Lion of Andor. As Morgase took a goblet, Alteima
noticed her ring, a golden serpent eating its own tail. The Great Serpent ring was worn by some
women who had trained in the White Tower, as Morgase had, without becoming Aes Sedai, as well
as by Aes Sedai themselves. It was a thousand-year tradition for the Queens of Andor to be Tower
trained. But rumors were on every lip of a break between Morgase and Tar Valon, and the anti-Aes
Sedai sentiment in the streets could have been quashed quickly had Morgase wanted to. Why was she
still wearing the ring? Alteima would be careful of her words until she knew the answer.
The liveried woman withdrew to the far end of the room, out of earshot but close enough to see
when the wine needed replenishing.
Taking a sip, Morgase said, “It is long since we met. Is your husband well? Is he in Caemlyn

with you?”
Hastily Alteima shuffled her plans. She had not thought Morgase knew she had a husband, but
she had always been able to think on the run. “Tedosian was well when I last saw him.” The Light
send he died soon. As well to get on with it. “He was of some question about serving this Rand
al’Thor, and that is a dangerous chasm to straddle. Why, lords have been hung as if they were
common criminals.”
“Rand al’Thor,” Morgase mused softly. “I met him once. He did not look like one who would
name himself the Dragon Reborn. A frightened shepherd boy, trying not to show it. Yet thinking back,
he seemed to be looking for some—escape.” Her blue eyes looked inward. “Elaida warned me of
him.” She seemed unaware of having spoken those last words.
“Elaida was your advisor then?” Alteima said cautiously. She knew it was so, and it made the
rumors of a break all the more difficult to believe. She had to know if it was true. “You have replaced
her, now that she is Amyrlin?”
Morgase’s eyes snapped back into focus. “I have not!” The next instant her voice softened again.
“My daughter, Elayne, is training in the Tower. She has already been raised to the Accepted.”
Alteima fluttered her fan, hoping sweat was not breaking out on her forehead. If Morgase did not
know her own feelings toward the Tower, there was no way to speak safely. Her plans teetered on the
edge of a precipice.
Then Morgase rescued them, and her. “You say your husband was of two minds about Rand
al’Thor. And you?”
She nearly sighed with relief. Morgase might be behaving like an untutored farmgirl over this
Gaebril, but she still had her sense when it came to power and possible dangers to her realm. “I
observed him closely, of course, in the Stone.” That should plant the seed, if it needed planting. “He
can channel, and a man who can channel is always to be feared. Yet he is the Dragon Reborn. There
is no doubt. The Stone fell, and Callandor was in his hand when it did. The Prophecies . . . I fear I
must leave decisions of what to do about the Dragon Reborn to those who are wiser than I. I only
know that I am afraid to remain where he rules. Even a High Lady of Tear cannot match the courage
of the Queen of Andor.”
The golden-haired woman gave her a shrewd look that made her afraid she had overdone the
flattery. Some did not like it too open. But Morgase merely leaned back in her chair and sipped her
wine. “Tell me about him, this man who is supposed to save us, and destroy us doing it.”
Success. Or at least, the beginnings of it. “He is a dangerous man beyond any question of the
Power. A lion seems lazy, half-asleep, until suddenly he charges; then he is all speed and power.
Rand al’Thor seems innocent, not lazy, and naive, not asleep, but when he charges . . . He has no
proper respect for person or position at all. I did not exaggerate when I said he has hanged lords. He
is a breeder of anarchy. In Tear under his new laws, even a High Lord or Lady can be called before a
magistrate, to be fined or worse, on the charges of the meanest peasant or fisherman. He . . .”
She kept strictly to the truth as she saw it; she could tell the truth as quickly as a lie when it was
necessary. Morgase sipped her wine and listened; Alteima might have thought her lounging indolently,
except that her eyes showed she was taking in every word and storing it. “You must understand,”
Alteima finished, “that I have only touched the surface. Rand al’Thor and what he has done in Tear
are subjects for hours.”
“You will have them,” Morgase said, and in her mind Alteima smiled. Success. “Is it true,” the
Queen went on, “that he brought Aiel with him to the Stone?”
“Oh, yes. Great savages with their faces hidden half the time, and even the women ready to kill

as soon as look. They followed him like dogs, terrorizing everyone, and took whatever they wanted
from the Stone.”
“I had thought it must be the wildest rumor,” Morgase reflected. “There have been rumors this
past year, but they have not come out of the Waste in twenty years, not since the Aiel War. The world
certainly does not need this Rand al’Thor bringing the Aiel down on us again.” Her look sharpened
again. “You said ‘followed.’ They have gone?”
Alteima nodded. “Just before I left Tear. And he went with them.”
“With them!” Morgase exclaimed. “I feared he was in Cairhien right this—”
“You have a guest, Morgase? I should have been told, so I could greet her.”
A big man strode into the room, tall, his gold-embroidered red silk coat fitting massive
shoulders and a deep chest. Alteima did not need to see the radiant look on Morgase’s face to name
him as Lord Gaebril; the assurance with which he had interrupted the Queen did that. He lifted a
finger, and the serving woman curtsied and left quickly; he did not ask Morgase’s permission to
dismiss her servants from her presence, either. He was darkly handsome, incredibly so, with wings of
white at his temples.
Composing her face to commonplace, Alteima put on a marginally welcoming smile, suitable for
an elderly uncle with neither power, wealth nor influence. He might be gorgeous, but even if he did
not belong to Morgase, he was not a man she would try manipulating unless she absolutely had to.
There was perhaps even more of an air of power about him than about Morgase.
Gaebril stopped by Morgase and put his hand on her bare shoulder in a very familiar way. She
clearly came close to resting her cheek on the back of his hand, but his eyes were on Alteima. She
was used to men looking at her, but these eyes made her shift uneasily; they were far too penetrating,
saw far too much.
“You come from Tear?” The sound of his deep voice sent a tingle through her; her skin, even her
bones, felt as though she had been dipped in icy water, but oddly her momentary anxiety melted.
It was Morgase who answered; Alteima could not seem to find her tongue with him watching
her. “This is the High Lady Alteima, Gaebril. She has been telling me all about the Dragon Reborn.
She was in the Stone of Tear when it fell. Gaebril, there really were Aiel—” The pressure of his
hand cut her off. Irritation flashed across her face, but then it was gone, replaced by a smile beaming
up at him.
His eyes, still on Alteima, sent that shiver through her again, and this time she gasped aloud. “So
much talking must have fatigued you, Morgase,” he said without shifting his gaze. “You do too much.
Go to your bedchamber and sleep. Go now. I will wake you when you have rested enough.”
Morgase stood immediately, still smiling at him devotedly. Her eyes seemed slightly glazed.
“Yes, I am tired. I will take a nap now, Gaebril.”
She glided from the room with never a glance at Alteima, but Alteima’s attention was all on
Gaebril. Her heart beat faster; her breath quickened. He was surely the handsomest man she had ever
seen. The grandest, the strongest, the most powerful. . . . Superlatives rolled through her mind like a
flood.
Gaebril paid no more attention to Morgase’s leaving than she did. Taking the chair the Queen
had vacated, he leaned back with his boots stretched out in front of him. “Tell me why you came to
Caemlyn, Alteima.” Again the chill ran through her. “The absolute truth, but keep it brief. You can
give me details later if I want them.”
She did not hesitate. “I tried to poison my husband and had to flee before Tedosian and that trull
Estanda could kill me instead, or worse. Rand al’Thor meant to let them do it, as an example.”

Telling made her cringe. Not because it was a truth she had kept hidden so much as because she found
she wanted to please him more than anything else in the world, and she feared that he might send her
away. But he wanted the truth. “I chose Caemlyn because I could not bear Illian and though Andor is
little better, Cairhien is in near ruins. In Caemlyn, I can find a wealthy husband, or one who thinks he
is my protector if need be, and use his power to—”
He stopped her with a wave of his hand, chuckling. “A vicious little cat, though pretty. Perhaps
pretty enough to keep, with your teeth and claws drawn.” Suddenly his face became more intent. “Tell
me what you know of Rand al’Thor, and especially his friends, if he has any, his companions, his
allies.”
She told him, talking until her mouth and throat went dry, and her voice cracked and rasped. She
never raised her goblet until he told her to drink; then she gulped the wine down and spoke on. She
could please him. She could please him better than Morgase could think of.
The maids working in Morgase’s bedchamber dropped hasty curtsies, surprised to see her there
in the middle of the morning. Waving them out of the room, she climbed onto her bed still in her
dress. For a time she lay staring at the gilded carvings of the bedposts. No Lions of Andor here, but
roses. For the Rose Crown of Andor, but roses suited her better than lions.
Stop being stubborn, she chided herself, then wondered why. She had told Gaebril she was
tired, and . . . Or had he told her? Impossible. She was the Queen of Andor, and no man told her to do
anything. Gareth. Now why had she thought of Gareth Bryne? He had certainly never told her to do
anything; the Captain-General of the Queen’s Guards obeyed the Queen, not the other way around. But
he had been stubborn, entirely capable of digging in his heels until she came around to his way. Why
am I thinking of him? I wish he were here. That was ridiculous. She had sent him away for opposing
her; about what no longer seemed quite clear, but that was not important. He had opposed her. She
could remember the feelings she had had for him only dimly, as though he had been gone for years.
Surely it had not been so long? Stop being stubborn!
Her eyes closed, and she fell immediately into sleep, a sleep troubled by restless dreams of
running from something she could not see.

CHAPTER
2

Rhuidean

High in the city of Rhuidean, Rand al’Thor looked out from a tall window; whatever glass
might have once been in it was long since gone. The shadows below slanted sharply east. A bardharp played softly in the room behind him. Sweat evaporated from his face almost as soon as it
appeared; his red silk coat, damp between the shoulders, hung open in a fruitless bid for air, and his
shirt was unlaced half down his chest. Night in the Aiel Waste would bring freezing cold, but during
daylight even a breeze was never cool.
With his hands above his head on the smooth stone window frame, his coatsleeves fell down to
reveal the front part of the figure wrapped around each forearm: a golden-maned, serpentine creature
with eyes like the sun, scaled in scarlet and gold, each foot tipped with five golden claws. Part of his
skin, they were, not tattoos; they glittered like precious metals and polished gems, seemed almost
alive in the late-afternoon sunlight.
Those marked him, to the people on this side of the mountain range variously called the
Dragonwall or the Spine of the World, as He Who Comes With the Dawn. And like the herons
branded into his palms, they marked him for those beyond the Dragonwall, too, according to the
Prophecies, as the Dragon Reborn. In both cases prophesied to unite, save—and destroy.
They were names he would have avoided if he could, but that time was long past if it had ever
existed, and he no longer thought of it. Or if he did, on rare occasion, it was with the faint regret of a
man recalling a foolish dream of his boyhood. As if he were not close enough to boyhood to
remember every minute. Instead, he tried to think only of what he had to do. Fate and duty held him on
the path like a rider’s reins, but he had often been called stubborn. The end of the road must be
reached, but if it could be attained by a different way, maybe it need not be the end. Small chance. No
chance, almost certainly. The Prophecies demanded his blood.
Rhuidean stretched below him, seared by a sun still pitiless as it sank toward craggy mountains,
bleak, with barely a sign of vegetation. This rugged, broken land, where men had killed or died over
a pool of water they could step across, was the last place on earth anyone would think to find a great
city. Its long-ago builders had never finished their work. Impossibly tall buildings dotted the city,
stepped and slab-sided palaces that sometimes ended after eight or even ten stories, not with a roof
but with the ragged masonry of another half-built floor. The towers soared higher yet, but stopped in
jagged abruptness as often as not. Now a good quarter of the great structures, with their massive
columns and immense windows of colored glass, lay strewn as rubble across wide avenues with
broad strips of bare dirt down their centers, dirt that had never held the trees they were planned for.
The marvelous fountains stood dry as they had for hundreds upon hundreds of years. All that futile
labor, the builders finally dying with their work undone; yet at times Rand thought that maybe the city
had only been begun so he could find it.

Too proud, he thought. A man would have to be half-mad at least to be so proud. He could not
help chuckling dryly. There had been Aes Sedai with the men and women who had come here so long
ago, and they had known The Karaethon Cycle, the Prophecies of the Dragon. Or perhaps they had
written the Prophecies. Too proud by tenfold.
Directly below him lay a vast plaza, half-covered in stretching shadow, littered with a jumble of
statues and crystal chairs, oddities and peculiar shapes of metal or glass or stone, things he could put
no name to, scattered about in tangled heaps as if deposited by a storm. Even the shadows were cool
only by comparison. Rough-clothed men—not Aiel—sweated to load wagons with items chosen by a
short, slender woman in pristine blue silk, straight-backed and gliding from place to place as though
the heat did not press down on her as hard as on the others. Still, she wore a damp white cloth tied
around her temples; she just did not let herself show the effects of the sun. Rand would have wagered
she did not even perspire.
The workmen’s leader was a dark, bulky man named Hadnan Kadere, a supposed merchant
dressed all in cream-colored silk that was sweat-sodden today. He mopped his face continually with
a large handkerchief, shouting curses at the men—his wagon drivers and guards—but he leaped as
quickly as they to haul at whatever the slim woman pointed out, big or small. Aes Sedai had no need
of size to impose their will, but Rand thought Moiraine would have done as well if she had never
been near the White Tower.
Two of the men were trying to move what appeared to be an oddly twisted redstone doorframe;
the corners did not meet properly, and the eye did not want to follow the straight pieces. It stayed
upright, turning freely but refusing to tip over however they manhandled it. Then one slipped and fell
through the doorway up to his waist. Rand tensed. For a moment, the fellow seemed not to exist above
the waist; his legs kicked wildly in panic. Until Lan, a tall man in drab shades of green, strode over
and hauled him out again by his belt. Lan was Moiraine’s Warder, bonded to her in some way Rand
did not understand, and a hard man who moved like the Aiel, like a hunting wolf; the sword at his hip
did not seem part of him, it was part of him. He dropped the workman on the paving stones on the seat
of his breeches and left him there; the fellow’s terrified cries rose thinly to Rand, and his companion
looked ready to run. Several of Kadere’s men who had been close enough to see were looking at one
another and at the mountains around the city, plainly assessing their chances.
Moiraine appeared among them so quickly it seemed by the Power, moving smoothly from man
to man. Her manner made Rand almost hear the cool, imperious instructions coming from her lips, so
full of certainty that they would be obeyed that not obeying would seem foolish. In short order she
overrode resistance, stamped firmly on objections, chivvied them every one back to work. The pair
with the doorframe were soon dragging and shoving as hard as ever, if with frequent looks at
Moiraine when they thought she would not see. In her own way, she was even harder than Lan.
As far as Rand knew, all of those things down there were angreal or sa’angreal or ter’angreal,
made before the Breaking of the World to magnify the One Power or use it in various ways. Made
with the Power certainly, though not even Aes Sedai knew how to construct such things now. He more
than suspected the use of the twisted doorframe—a doorway to another world—but for the rest, he
had no idea. No one did. That was why Moiraine worked so hard, to have as many as she could
carted to the Tower for study. It was possible that even the Tower did not contain as many objects of
the Power as lay about this square, though supposedly the Tower held the largest collection in the
world. Even there, the Tower only knew the uses of some.
What was in the wagons or tossed about on the pavement did not interest Rand; he had already
taken what he needed from down there. Had already taken more than he wanted, in some ways.

In the center of the plaza, near the burned remains of a great tree a hundred feet high, stood a
small forest of tall glass columns, each nearly as tall as the tree and so slender it seemed the first
stormwind must bring them all crashing down. Even with an edge of shadow touching them, the
columns caught and refracted the sunlight in glitters and sparkles. For countless years Aielmen had
entered that array and returned marked as Rand was, but on only one arm, marked as clan chiefs. They
came out marked or did not come out. Aielwomen had come to this city as well, on the path toward
becoming Wise Ones. No one else, not and live. A man may go to Rhuidean once, a woman twice;
more means death. That was what the Wise Ones had said, and it had been truth, then. Now anyone
could enter Rhuidean.
Hundreds of Aiel walked the streets, and increasing numbers actually dwelled in the buildings;
each day more of the dirt strips down the streets showed beans or squash or zemai, arduously
watered from clay pots hauled from the huge new lake that filled the south end of the valley, the only
such body of water in the entire land. Thousands made their camps in the surrounding mountains, even
on Chaendaer itself, where before they had come only with ceremony, to send a single man or woman
at a time into Rhuidean.
Wherever he went, Rand brought change and destruction. This time, he hoped against hope that
the change was for the good. It might yet be so. The burned tree mocked him. Avendesora, the
legendary Tree of Life; the stories never said where it was, and it had been a surprise to find it here.
Moiraine said it still lived, that it would put out shoots again, but so far he saw only blackened bark
and bare branches.
With a sigh, he turned from the window into a big room, though not the biggest in Rhuidean, with
tall windows on two sides, its domed ceiling worked in a fanciful mosaic of winged people and
animals. Most of the furniture left in the city had long since rotted away even in the dryness, and much
of the little that remained was riddled with beetles and worms. But on the far side of the room stood
one high-backed chair, solid, and its gilding largely intact, but mismatched with its table, a wide thing
with legs and edges thickly carved in flowers. Someone had polished the wood with beeswax till it
shone dully despite its age. The Aiel had found them for him, though they shook their heads at such
things; there were few trees in the Waste that could have produced wood straight and long enough to
make that chair, and none to make the table.
That was all the furniture, as he thought of it. A fine silk Illianer carpet in blue and gold, booty in
some long-ago battle, covered the middle of the dark red floor tiles. Cushions lay scattered about, in
bright silks, and tasseled. Those were what Aiel used instead of chairs, when they did not merely sit
on their heels, as comfortable as he would be in a padded chair.
Six men reclined against cushions on the carpet. Six clan chiefs, representing the clans that had
so far come to follow Rand. Or rather, to follow He Who Comes With the Dawn. Not always eagerly.
He thought Rhuarc, a broad-shouldered, blue-eyed man with heavy streaks of gray in his dark red
hair, might have some friendship for him, but not the rest. Only six of the twelve.
Ignoring the chair, Rand sat down cross-legged, facing the Aiel. Outside of Rhuidean, the only
chairs in the Waste were chief’s chairs, used only by the chief and only for three reasons: to be
acclaimed as clan chief, to accept the submission of an enemy with honor, or to pass judgment. Taking
the chair with these men now would imply that he meant to do one of those.
They wore the cadin’sor, coats and breeches in shades of brown and gray that would fade into
the ground, and soft boots that laced to the knee. Even here, meeting with the man they had proclaimed
the Car’a’carn, the chief of chiefs, each had a heavy-bladed knife at his belt and the gray-brown
shoufa draped like a wide scarf around his neck; if any man covered his face with the black veil that

was part of the shoufa, he would be ready to kill. It was not beyond possibility. These men had fought
one another in a never-ending cycle of clan raids and battles and feuds. They watched him, waited for
him, but an Aiel’s waiting always spoke of a readiness to move, suddenly and violently.
Bael, the tallest man Rand had ever seen, and Jheran, blade-slender and whip-quick, lay as far
from one another as they could manage and still be on the carpet. There was blood feud between
Bael’s Goshien and Jheran’s Shaarad, suppressed for He Who Comes With the Dawn but not
forgotten. And perhaps the Peace of Rhuidean still held, despite all that had happened. Still, the
tranquil sounds of the harp made a sharp contrast with the hard refusal of Bael and Jheran to look at
one another. Six sets of eyes, blue or green or gray, in sun-dark faces; Aiel could make hawks look
tame.
“What must I do to bring the Reyn to me?” he said. “You were sure they would come, Rhuarc.”
The chief of the Taardad looked at him calmly; his face could have been carved stone for all its
expression. “Wait. Only that. Dhearic will bring them. Eventually.”
White-haired Han, lying next to Rhuarc, twisted his mouth as if about to spit. His leathery face
wore a sour look, as usual. “Dhearic has seen too many men and Maidens sit staring for days, then
throw down their spears. Throw them down!”
“And run away,” Bael added quietly. “I have seen them myself, among the Goshien, even from
my own sept, running. And you, Han, among the Tomanelle. We all have. I do not think they know
where they are running to, only what they are running from.”
“Cowardly snakes,” Jheran barked. Gray streaked his light brown hair; there were no young men
among Aiel clan chiefs. “Stinkadders, wriggling away from their own shadows.” A slight shift of his
blue eyes toward the far side of the carpet made it clear he meant it for a description of the Goshien,
not just those who had thrown down their spears.
Bael made as if to rise, his face hardening further, if that was possible, but the man next to him
put a quieting hand on his arm. Bruan, of the Nakai, was big enough and strong enough for two
blacksmiths, but he had a placid nature that seemed odd for an Aiel. “All of us have seen men and
Maidens run.” He sounded almost lazy, and his gray eyes looked so, yet Rand knew otherwise; even
Rhuarc considered Bruan a deadly fighter and a devious tactician. Luckily, not even Rhuarc was
stronger for Rand than Bruan. But he had come to follow He Who Comes With the Dawn; he did not
know Rand al’Thor. “As you have, Jheran. You know how hard it was to face what they face. If you
cannot name coward those who died because they could not face it, can you name coward those who
run for the same reason?”
“They should never have learned,” Han muttered, kneading his red-tasseled blue cushion like an
enemy’s throat. “It was for those who could enter Rhuidean and live.”
He spoke the words to no one in particular, but they had to be for Rand’s ears. It was Rand who
had revealed to everyone what a man learned amid the glass columns in the plaza, revealed enough
that the chiefs and Wise Ones could not turn aside when asked the rest. If there was an Aiel in the
Waste who did not know the truth now, he had not spoken to anyone in a month.
Far from the glorious heritage of battle most believed in, the Aiel had begun as helpless refugees
from the Breaking of the World. Everyone who survived had been refugees then, of course, but the
Aiel had never seen themselves as helpless. Worse, they had been followers of the Way of the Leaf,
refusing to do violence even in defense of their lives. Aiel meant “dedicated” in the Old Tongue, and
it had been to peace that they were dedicated. Those who called themselves Aiel today were the
descendants of those who had broken a pledge of untold generations. Only one remnant of that belief
remained: an Aiel would die before taking up a sword. They had always believed it a part of their

pride, of their separateness from those who lived outside the Waste.
He had heard Aiel say that they had committed some sin to be placed in the desolate Waste.
Now they knew what it was. The men and women who had built Rhuidean and died here—those
called the Jenn Aiel, the Clan That Was Not, on the few occasions they were spoken of—had been the
ones who kept faith with the Aes Sedai of the time before the Breaking. It was hard to face the
knowledge that what you had always believed was a lie.
“It had to be told,” Rand said. They had a right to know. A man shouldn’t have to live a lie.
Their own prophecy said I would break them. And I couldn’t have done differently. The past was
past and done; he should be worrying about the future. Some of these men dislike me, and some hate
me for not being born among them, but they follow. I need them all. “What of the Miagoma?”
Erim, lying between Rhuarc and Han, shook his head. His once bright red hair was half white,
but his green eyes were as strong as any younger man’s. His big hands, wide and long and hard, said
his arms were as strong, too. “Timolan does not let his feet know which way he will jump until after
he has leaped.”
“When Timolan was young as a chief,” Jheran said, “he tried to unite the clans and failed. It will
not sit well with him that at last one has come to succeed where he failed.”
“He will come,” Rhuarc said. “Timolan never believed himself He Who Comes With the Dawn.
And Janwin will bring the Shiande. But they will wait. They must settle matters in their own minds
first.”
“They must settle He Who Comes With the Dawn being a wetlander,” Han barked. “I mean no
offense, Car’a’carn.” There was no obsequiousness in his voice; a chief was not a king, and neither
was the chief of chiefs. At best he was first among equals.
“The Daryne and the Codarra will come eventually, as well, I think,” Bruan said calmly. And
quickly, lest silence should grow to a reason for dancing the spears. First among equals at best. “They
have lost more than any other clan to the bleakness.” That was what the Aiel had taken to calling the
long period of staring before someone tried to run away from being Aiel. “For the moment,
Mandelain and Indirian are concerned with holding their clans together, and both will want to see the
Dragons on your arms for themselves, but they will come.”
That left only one clan to be discussed, the one none of the chiefs wanted to mention. “What
news of Couladin and the Shaido?” Rand asked.
Silence answered him, broken only by the softly serene sounds of the harp in the background,
each man waiting for another to speak, all coming as close as Aiel could to showing discomfort.
Jheran frowned at his thumbnail, and Bruan toyed with one of the silvery tassels on his green cushion.
Even Rhuarc studied the carpet.
Graceful, white-robed men and women moved into the hush, pouring worked silver goblets of
wine to set beside each man, bringing small silver plates with olives, rare in the Waste, and white
ewe’s-milk cheese, and the pale, wrinkled nuts the Aiel called pecara. The Aiel faces looking out of
those pale cowls had downcast eyes and an unfamiliar meekness on their features.
Whether captured in battle or on a raid, the gai’shain were sworn to serve obediently for one
year and a day, touching no weapon, doing no violence, at the end returning to their own clan and sept
as if nothing had happened. A strange echo of the Way of the Leaf. Ji’e’toh, honor and obligation,
required it, and breaking ji’e’toh was nearly the worst thing an Aiel could do. Perhaps the worst. It
was possible that some of these men and women were serving their own clan chief, but neither would
acknowledge it by the blink of an eye so long as the period of gai’shain held, not even for a son or
daughter.

It struck Rand suddenly that this was the real reason that some Aiel took what he had revealed so
hard. To those, it must seem that their ancestors had sworn gai’shain, not only for themselves but for
all succeeding generations. And those generations—all, down to the present day—had broken ji’e’toh
by taking up the spear. Had the men in front of him ever worried along those lines? Ji’e’toh was very
serious business to an Aiel.
The gai’shain departed on soft slippered feet, barely making a sound. None of the clan chiefs
touched their wine, or the food.
“Is there any hope that Couladin will meet with me?” Rand knew there was not; he had stopped
sending requests for a meeting once he learned Couladin was having the messengers skinned alive.
But it was a way to start the others talking.
Han snorted. “The only word we have had from him is that he means to flay you when next he
sees you. Does that sound as if he will talk?”
“Can I break the Shaido away from him?”
“They follow him,” Rhuarc said. “He is not a chief at all, but they believe he is.” Couladin had
never entered those glass columns; he might even still believe as he claimed, that everything Rand had
said was a lie. “He says that he is the Car’a’carn, and they believe that as well. The Shaido Maidens
who came, came for their society, and that because Far Dareis Mai carried your honor. None else
will.”
“We send scouts to watch them,” Bruan said, “and the Shaido kill them when they can—
Couladin builds the makings of half a dozen feuds—but so far he shows no signs of attacking us here.
I have heard that he claims we have defiled Rhuidean, and that attacking us here would only deepen
the desecration.”
Erim grunted and shifted on his cushion. “He means there are enough spears here to kill every
Shaido twice over and to spare.” He popped a piece of white cheese into his mouth, growling around
it. “The Shaido were ever cowards and thieves.”
“Honorless dogs,” Bael and Jheran said together, then stared at one another as though each
thought the other had tricked him into something.
“Honorless or not,” Bruan said quietly, “Couladin’s numbers are growing.” Calm as he sounded,
he still took a deep drink from his goblet before going on. “You all know what I am speaking of.
Some of those who run, after the bleakness, do not throw away their spears. Instead they join with
their societies among the Shaido.”
“No Tomanelle has ever broken clan,” Han barked.
Bruan looked past Rhuarc and Erim at the Tomanelle chief and said deliberately, “It has
happened in every clan.” Without waiting for another challenge to his word, he settled back on his
cushion. “It cannot be called breaking clan. They join their societies. Like the Shaido Maidens who
have come to their Roof here.”
There were a few mutters, but no one disputed him this time. The rules governing Aiel warrior
societies were complex, and in some ways their members felt as closely bound to society as to clan.
For instance, members of the same society would not fight each other even if their clans were in
blood feud. Some men would not marry a woman too closely related to a member of their own
society, just as if that made her their own close blood kin. The ways of Far Dareis Mai, the Maidens
of the Spear, Rand did not even want to think about.
“I need to know what Couladin intends,” he told them. Couladin was a bull with a bee in his ear;
he might charge in any direction. Rand hesitated. “Would it violate honor to send people to join their
societies among the Shaido?” He did not need to describe what he meant any further. To a man, they

stiffened where they lay, even Rhuarc, eyes cold enough to banish the heat from the room.
“To spy in that manner”—Erim twisted his mouth around “spy” as if the word tasted foul
—“would be like spying on your own sept. No one of honor would do such a thing.”
Rand refrained from asking whether they might find someone with a slightly less prickly honor.
The Aiel sense of humor was a strange thing, often cruel, but about some matters they had none at all.
To change the subject, he asked, “Is there any word from across the Dragonwall?” He knew the
answer; that sort of news spread quickly even among as many Aiel as were gathered around
Rhuidean.
“None worth the telling,” Rhuarc replied. “With the troubles among the treekillers, few peddlers
come into the Three-fold Land.” That was the Aiel name for the Waste; a punishment for their sin, a
testing ground for their courage, an anvil to shape them. “Treekillers” was what they called
Cairhienin. “The Dragon banner still flies over the Stone of Tear. Tairens have moved north into
Cairhien as you ordered, to distribute food among the treekillers. Nothing more.”
“You should have let the treekillers starve,” Bael muttered, and Jheran closed his mouth with a
snap. Rand suspected he had been about to say much the same.
“Treekillers are fit for nothing except to be killed or sold as animals in Shara,” Erim said
grimly. Those were two of the things Aiel did to those who came into the Waste uninvited; only
gleeman, peddlers, and Tinkers had safe passage, though Aiel avoided the Tinkers as if they carried
fever. Shara was the name of the lands beyond the Waste; not even the Aiel knew much about them.
From the corner of his eye, Rand saw two women standing expectantly just inside the tall,
arched doorway. Someone had hung strings of colored beads there, red and blue, to replace the
missing doors. One of the women was Moiraine. For a moment he considered making them wait;
Moiraine had that irritatingly commanding look on her face, clearly expecting them to break off
everything for her. Only, there was really nothing left to discuss, and he could tell from the men’s
eyes that they did not want to make conversation. Not so soon after speaking of the bleakness, and the
Shaido.
Sighing, he stood, and the clan chiefs imitated him. All except Han were as tall as he or taller.
Where Rand had grown up, Han would have been considered of average height or better; among Aiel,
he was accounted short. “You know what must be done. Bring in the rest of the clans, and keep an eye
on the Shaido.” He paused a moment, then added, “It will end well. As well for the Aiel as I can
manage.”
“The prophecy said you would break us,” Han said sourly, “and you have made a good
beginning. But we will follow you. Till shade is gone,” he recited, “till water is gone, into the
Shadow with teeth bared, screaming defiance with the last breath, to spit in Sightblinder’s eye on the
Last Day.” Sightblinder was one of the Aiel names for the Dark One.
There was nothing for Rand except to make the proper response. Once he had not known it. “By
my honor and the Light, my life will be a dagger for Sightblinder’s heart.”
“Until the Last Day,” the Aiel finished, “to Shayol Ghul itself.” The harper played on
pacifically.
The chiefs filed out past the two women, eyeing Moiraine respectfully. There was nothing of
fear in them. Rand wished he could be as sure of himself. Moiraine had too many plans for him, too
many ways of pulling strings he did not know she had tied to him.
The two women came in as soon as the chiefs were gone, Moiraine as cool and elegant as ever.
A small, pretty woman, with or without those Aes Sedai features he could never put an age to, she had
abandoned the damp, cooling cloth for her temples. In its place, a small blue stone hung suspended on

her forehead from a fine golden chain in her dark hair. It would not have mattered if she had kept it;
nothing could diminish her queenly carriage. She usually seemed to own a foot more height than she
actually had, and her eyes were all confidence and command.
The other woman was taller, though still short of his shoulder, and young, not ageless. Egwene,
whom he had grown up with. Now, except for her big dark eyes, she could almost have passed as an
Aiel woman, and not only for her tanned face and hands. She wore a full Aiel skirt of brown wool
and a loose white blouse of a plant fiber called algode. Algode was softer than even the finest-woven
wool; it would do very well for trade, if he ever convinced the Aiel. A gray shawl hung around
Egwene’s shoulders, and a folded gray scarf made a wide band to hold back the dark hair that fell
below her shoulders. Unlike most Aielwomen, she wore only one bracelet, ivory carved into a circle
of flames, and a single necklace of gold and ivory beads. And one more thing. A Great Serpent ring
on her left hand.
Egwene had been studying with some of the Aiel Wise Ones—exactly what, Rand did not know,
though he more than suspected something to do with dreams; Egwene and the Aielwomen were
closemouthed—but she had studied in the White Tower, too. She was one of the Accepted, on the
way to becoming Aes Sedai. And passing herself off, here and in Tear at least, as full Aes Sedai
already. Sometimes he teased her about that; she did not take his japes very well, though.
“The wagons will be ready to leave for Tar Valon soon,” Moiraine said. Her voice was
musical, crystalline.
“Send a strong guard,” Rand said, “or Kadere may not take them where you want.” He turned for
the windows again, wanting to look out and think, about Kadere. “You’ve not needed me to hold your
hand or give you permission before.”
Abruptly something seemed to strike him across the shoulders, for all the world like a thick
hickory stick; only the slight feel of goose bumps on his skin, not likely in this heat, told him that one
of the women had channeled.
Spinning back to face them, he reached out to saidin, filled himself with the One Power. The
Power felt like life itself swelling inside him, as if he were ten times, a hundred times as alive; the
Dark One’s taint filled him, too, death and corruption, like maggots crawling in his mouth. It was a
torrent that threatened to sweep him away, a raging flood he had to fight every moment. He was
almost used to it now, and at the same time he would never be used to it. He wanted to hold on to the
sweetness of saidin forever, and he wanted to vomit. And all the while the deluge tried to scour him
to the bone and burn his bones to ash.
The taint would drive him mad eventually, if the Power did not kill him first; it was a race
between the two. Madness had been the fate of every man who had channeled since the Breaking of
the World began, since that day when Lews Therin Telamon, the Dragon, and his Hundred
Companions had sealed up the Dark One’s prison at Shayol Ghul. The last backblast from that sealing
had tainted the male half of the True Source, and men who could channel, madmen who could
channel, had torn the world apart.
He filled himself with the Power. . . . And he could not tell which woman had done it. They both
looked at him as if butter would not melt in their mouths, each with an eyebrow arched almost
identically in slightly amused questioning. Either or both could be embracing the female half of the
Source right that instant, and he would never know.
Of course, a stick across the shoulders was not Moiraine’s way; she found other means of
chastising, more subtle, usually more painful in the end. Yet even sure that it must have been Egwene,
he did nothing. Proof. Thought slid along the outside of the Void; he floated within, in emptiness,

thought and emotion, even his anger, distant. I will do nothing without proof. I will not be goaded,
this time. She was not the Egwene he had grown up with; she had become part of the Tower since
Moiraine sent her there. Moiraine again. Always Moiraine. Sometimes he wished he were rid of
Moiraine. Only sometimes?
He concentrated on her. “What do you want of me?” His voice sounded flat and cold to his own
ears. The Power stormed inside him. Egwene had told him that for a woman, touching saidar, the
female half of the Source, was an embrace; for a man, always, it was a war without mercy. “And
don’t mention wagons again, little sister. I usually find out what you mean to do long after it is done.”
The Aes Sedai frowned at him, and no wonder. She was surely not used to being addressed so,
not by any man, even the Dragon Reborn. He had no idea himself where “little sister” had come from;
sometimes of late words seemed to pop into his head. A touch of madness, perhaps. Some nights he
lay awake till the small hours, worrying about that. Inside the Void, it seemed someone else’s worry.
“We should speak alone.” She gave the harper a cool glance.
Jasin Natael, as he called himself here, lay half-sprawled on cushions against one of the
windowless walls, softly playing the harp perched on his knee, its upper arm carved and gilded to
resemble the creatures on Rand’s forearms. Dragons, the Aiel called them. Rand had only suspicions
where Natael had gotten the thing. He was a dark-haired man, who would have been accounted taller
than most elsewhere than the Aiel Waste, in his middle years. His coat and breeches were dark blue
silk suitable for a royal court, elaborately embroidered with thread-of-gold on collar and cuffs,
everything buttoned up or laced despite the heat. The fine clothes were at odds with his gleeman’s
cloak spread out beside him. A perfectly sound cloak, but covered completely with hundreds of
patches in nearly as many colors, all sewn so as to flutter at the slightest breeze, it signified a country
entertainer, a juggler and tumbler, musician and storyteller who wandered from village to village.
Certainly not a man to wear silk. The man had his conceits. He appeared completely immersed in his
music.
“You can say what you wish in front of Natael,” Rand said. “He is gleeman to the Dragon
Reborn, after all.” If keeping the matter secret was important enough, she would press it, and he
would send Natael away, though he did not like the man to be out of his sight.
Egwene sniffed loudly and shifted her shawl on her shoulders. “Your head is swelled up like an
overripe melon, Rand al’Thor.” She said it flatly, as a statement of fact.
Anger bubbled outside the Void. Not at what she had said; she had been in the habit of trying to
take him down a rung even when they were children, usually whether he deserved it or not. But of late
it seemed to him she had taken to working with Moiraine, trying to put him off balance so the Aes
Sedai could push him where she wanted. When they were younger, before they learned what he was,
he and Egwene had thought they would marry one day. And now she sided with Moiraine against him.
Face hard, he spoke more roughly than he intended. “Tell me what you want, Moiraine. Tell me
here and now, or let it wait until I can find time for you. I’m very busy.” That was an outright lie.
Most of his time was spent practicing the sword with Lan, or the spears with Rhuarc, or learning to
fight with hands and feet from both. But if there was any bullying to be done here today, he would do
it. Natael could hear anything. Almost anything. So long as Rand knew where he was at all times.
Moiraine and Egwene both frowned, but the real Aes Sedai at least seemed to see he would not
be budged this time. She glanced at Natael, her mouth tightening—the man still seemed deep in his
music—then took a thick wad of gray silk from her pouch.
Unfolding it, she laid what it had contained on the table, a disc the size of a man’s hand, half
dead black, half purest white, the two colors meeting in a sinuous line to form two joined teardrops.

That had been the symbol of Aes Sedai, before the Breaking, but this disc was more. Only seven like
it had ever been made, the seals on the Dark One’s prison. Or rather, each was a focus for one of
those seals. Drawing her belt knife, its hilt wrapped in silver wire, Moiraine scraped delicately at the
edge of the disc. And a tiny flake of solid black fell away.
Even encased in the Void, Rand gasped. The emptiness itself quivered, and for an instant the
Power threatened to overwhelm him. “Is this a copy? A fake?”
“I found this in the square below,” Moiraine said. “It is real, though. The one I brought with me
from Tear is the same.” She could have been saying she wanted pea soup for the midday meal.
Egwene, on the other hand, clutched her shawl around her as if cold.
Rand felt the stirrings of fright himself, oozing across the surface of the Void. It was an effort to
let go of saidin, but he forced himself. If he lost concentration, the Power could destroy him where he
stood, and he wanted all his attention on the matter at hand. Even so, even with the taint, it was a loss.
That flake lying on the table was impossible. Those discs were made of cuendillar, heartstone,
and nothing made of cuendillar could be broken, not even by the One Power. Whatever force was
used against it only made it stronger. The making of heartstone had been lost in the Breaking of the
World, but whatever had been made of it during the Age of Legends still existed, even the most
fragile vase, even if the Breaking had sunk it to the bottom of the ocean or buried it beneath a
mountain. Of course, three of the seven discs were broken already, but it had taken a good deal more
than a knife.
Come to think of it, though, he did not know how those three really had been broken. If no force
short of the Creator could break heartstone, then that should be that.
“How?” he asked, surprised that his voice was still as steady as when the Void had surrounded
him.
“I do not know,” Moiraine replied, just as calm outwardly. “But you do see the problem? A fall
from the table could break this. If the others, wherever they may be, are like this, four men with
hammers could break open that hole in the Dark One’s prison again. Who can even say how effective
one is, in this condition?”
Rand saw. I’m not ready yet. He was not sure he ever would be ready, but he surely was not
yet. Egwene looked as though she were staring into her own open grave.
Rewrapping the disc, Moiraine replaced it in her pouch. “Perhaps I will think of a possibility
before I carry this to Tar Valon. If we know why, perhaps something can be done about it.”
He was caught by the image of the Dark One reaching out from Shayol Ghul once more,
eventually breaking free completely; fires and darkness covered the world in his mind, flames that
consumed and gave no light, blackness solid as stone squeezing the air. With that filling his head,
what Moiraine had just said took a moment to penetrate. “You intend to go yourself?” He had thought
she meant to stick to him like moss to a rock. Isn’t this what you want?
“Eventually,” Moiraine replied quietly. “Eventually I will—have to leave you, after all. What
will be, must be.” Rand thought she shivered, but it was so quick it could have been his imagination,
and the next instant she was all composure and self-control once more. “You must be ready.” The
reminder of his doubts came unpleasantly. “We should discuss your plans. You cannot sit here much
longer. Even if the Forsaken are not planning to come after you, they are out there, spreading their
power. Gathering the Aiel will do no good if you find that everything beyond the Spine of the World
is in their hands.”
Chuckling, Rand leaned back against the table. So this was just another ploy; if he was anxious
about her leaving, perhaps he would be more willing to listen, more amenable to being guided. She

could not lie, of course, not right out. One of the vaunted Three Oaths took care of that: to speak no
word that was not true. He had learned that it left a barn-width of wriggle room. She would leave him
alone eventually. After he was dead, no doubt.
“You want to discuss my plans,” he said dryly. Pulling a short-stemmed pipe and a leather tabac
pouch from his coat pocket, he thumbed the bowl full and briefly touched saidin to channel a flame
dancing above the tabac. “Why? They are my plans.” Puffing slowly, he waited, ignoring Egwene’s
glower.
The Aes Sedai’s face never changed, but her large, dark eyes seemed to blaze. “What have you
done when you refused to be guided by me?” Her voice was as cool as her features, yet the words
still seemed to come like whip-cracks. “Wherever you have gone, you have left death, destruction and
war behind you.”
“Not in Tear,” he said, too quickly. And too defensively. He must not let her put him off balance.
Determinedly, he took spaced, deliberate puffs at his pipe.
“No,” she agreed, “not in Tear. For once you had a nation behind you, a people, and what did
you do with it? Bringing justice to Tear was commendable. Establishing order in Cairhien, feeding
the hungry, is laudable. Another time I would praise you for it.” She herself was Cairhienin. “But it
does not help you toward the day you face Tarmon Gai’don.” A single-minded woman, and cold
when it came to anything else, even her own land. But should he not be just as single-minded?
“What would you have me do? Hunt down the Forsaken one by one?” Again he forced himself to
draw more slowly on the pipe; it was an effort. “Do you even know where they are? Oh, Sammael is
in Illian—you know that—but the rest? What if I go after Sammael as you wish, and find two or three
or four of them? Or all nine?”
“You could have faced three or four, perhaps all nine surviving,” she said icily, “had you not left
Callandor in Tear. The truth is, you are running. You do not really have a plan, not a plan to ready
you for the Last Battle. You run from place to place, hoping that in some way everything will come
out for the best. Hoping, because you do not know what else to do. If you would take my advice, at
least you—” He cut her off, gesturing sharply with his pipe, with never a care for the glares the two
women gave him.
“I do have a plan.” If they wanted to know, let them know, and he would be burned if he changed
a word. “First, I mean to put an end to the wars and killing, whether I started them or not. If men have
to kill, let them kill Trollocs, not each other. In the Aiel War, four clans crossed the Dragonwall, and
had their way for better than two years. They looted and burned Cairhien, defeated every army sent
against them. They could have taken Tar Valon, had they wanted. The Tower couldn’t have stopped
them, because of your Three Oaths.” Not to use the Power as a weapon except against Shadowspawn
or Darkfriends, or in defense of their own lives, that was another of the Oaths, and the Aiel had not
threatened the Tower itself. Anger had him in its grip now. Running and hoping, was he? “Four clans
did that. What will happen when I lead eleven across the Spine of the World?” It would have to be
eleven; small hope of bringing in the Shaido. “By the time the nations even think of uniting, it will be
too late. They’ll accept my peace, or I’ll be buried in the Can Breat.” A discordant plunk rose from
the harp, and Natael bent over the instrument, shaking his head. In a moment the soothing sounds came
again.
“A melon couldn’t be swollen enough for your head,” Egwene muttered, folding her arms
beneath her breasts. “And a stone couldn’t be as stubborn! Moiraine is only trying to help you. Why
won’t you see that?”
The Aes Sedai smoothed her silk skirts, though they did not need it. “Taking the Aiel across the

Dragonwall might be the worst thing you could possibly do.” There was an edge to her voice, anger
or frustration. At least he was getting across to her that he was no puppet. “By this time, the Amyrlin
Seat will be approaching the rulers of every nation that still has a ruler, laying the proofs before them
that you are the Dragon Reborn. They know the Prophecies; they know what you were born to do.
Once they are convinced of who and what you are, they will accept you because they must. The Last
Battle is coming, and you are their only hope, humankind’s only hope.”
Rand laughed out loud. It was a bitter laugh. Sticking his pipe between his teeth, he hoisted
himself to sit cross-legged atop the table, staring at them. “So you and Siuan Sanche still think you
know everything there is to know.” The Light willing, they did not know near everything about him,
and would never find out. “You’re both fools.”
“Show some respect!” Egwene growled, but Rand went on over her words.
“The Tairen High Lords know the Prophecies, too, and they knew me, once they saw the Sword
That Cannot Be Touched clutched in my fist. Half of them expect me to bring them power or glory or
both. The other half would as soon slip a knife in my back and try to forget the Dragon Reborn was
ever in Tear. That is how the nations will greet the Dragon Reborn. Unless I quell them first, the same
way I did the Tairens. Do you know why I left Callandor in Tear? To remind them of me. Every day
they know it is there, driven into the Heart of the Stone, and they know I’ll come back for it. That is
what holds them to me.” That was one reason he had left the Sword That Is Not a Sword behind. He
did not like even to think of the other.
“Be very careful,” Moiraine said after a moment. Just that, in a voice all frozen calm. He heard
stark warning in the words. Once he had heard her say in much the same tone that she would see him
dead before letting the Shadow have him. A hard woman.
For a long moment she gazed at him, her eyes dark pools that threatened to swallow him. Then
she made a perfect curtsy. “By your leave, my Lord Dragon, I will see to letting Master Kadere know
where I expect him to work tomorrow.”
No one could have seen or heard the faintest mockery in action or words, but Rand felt it.
Anything that might put him off balance, make him more biddable by guilt or shame or uncertainty or
whatever, she would try. He stared after her until the clicking beads in the doorway obscured her.
“There is no need you scowling like that, Rand al’Thor.” Egwene’s voice was low, her eyes
irate; she held on to her shawl as if she wanted to strangle him with it. “Lord Dragon, indeed!
Whatever you are, you’re a rude, ill-mannered lout. You deserve more than you got. It would not kill
you to be civil!”
“So it was you,” he snapped, but to his surprise she half-shook her head before catching herself.
It had been Moiraine after all. If the Aes Sedai was showing that much temper, something must be
wearing at her terribly. Him, no doubt. Perhaps he should apologize. I suppose it wouldn’t hurt to be
civil. Though he could not see why he was supposed to be mannerly to the Aes Sedai while she tried
to lead him on a leash.
But if he was thinking of trying to be polite, Egwene was not. If glowing coals were dark brown,
they would have been exactly like her eyes. “You are a wool-headed fool, Rand al’Thor, and I should
never have told Elayne you were good enough for her. You aren’t good enough for a weasel! Bring
your nose down. I remember you sweating, trying to talk your way out of some trouble Mat had gotten
you into. I can remember Nynaeve switching you till you howled, and you needing a cushion to sit on
the rest of the day. Not that many years gone, either. I ought to tell Elayne to forget you. If she knew
half what you’ve turned into . . .”
He gaped at her as the tirade went on, with her more furious than at any time since first coming

through the bead curtain. Then it hit him. That little near shake of her head that she had not meant to
give, letting him know it had been Moiraine who struck him with the Power. Egwene worked very
hard at doing what she was about in proper fashion. Studying with the Wise Ones, she wore Aiel
clothes; she might even be trying to adopt Aiel customs, for all he knew. It would be like her. But she
worked hard at being a proper Aes Sedai all the time, even if she was only one of the Accepted. Aes
Sedai usually kept a rein on their tempers, but they never ever gave anything away that they wanted to
hide.
Ilyena never flashed her temper at me when she was angry with herself. When she gave me the
rough side of her tongue, it was because she . . . His mind froze for an instant. He had never met a
woman named Ilyena in his life. But he could summon up a face for the name, dimly; a pretty face,
skin like cream, golden hair exactly the shade of Elayne’s. This had to be the madness. Remembering
an imaginary woman. Perhaps one day he would find himself having conversations with people who
were not there.
Egwene’s harangue shut off with a concerned look. “Are you all right, Rand?” The anger was
gone from her voice as if it had never been. “Is something wrong? Should I fetch Moiraine back to—”
“No!” he said, and just as quickly softened his own tone. “She can’t Heal. . . .” Even an Aes
Sedai could not Heal madness; none of them could Heal any of what ailed him. “Is Elayne well?”
“She is well.” Despite what Egwene had said, there was a hint of sympathy in her voice. That
was all he really expected. Beyond what he had known when Elayne left Tear, what she was up to
was an Aes Sedai concern and none of his; so Egwene had told him more than once, and Moiraine
echoed her. The three Wise Ones who could dreamwalk, those Egwene was studying with, had been
even less informative; they had their own reasons not to be pleased with him.
“I had best go, too,” Egwene went on, settling her shawl over her arms. “You are tired.”
Frowning slightly, she said, “Rand, what does it mean to be buried in the Can Breat?”
He started to ask what under the Light she was talking about. Then he remembered using that
phrase. “Just something I heard once,” he lied. He had no more idea what it meant than where it had
come from.
“You rest, Rand,” she said, sounding twenty years older rather than two younger. “Promise me
you will. You need it.” He nodded. She studied his face for a moment as though searching for the
truth, then started for the door.
Rand’s silver goblet of wine floated up from the carpet and drifted to him. He hastily snatched it
out of the air just before Egwene looked back over her shoulder.
“Perhaps I shouldn’t tell you this,” she said. “Elayne didn’t give it to me as a message for you,
but . . . She said she loves you. Perhaps you know already, but if you don’t, you should think about it.”
With that she was gone, the beads clicking together behind her.
Leaping from the table, Rand hurled the goblet away, splashing wine across the floor tiles as he
rounded on Jasin Natael in a fury.

CHAPTER
3

Pale Shadows

Seizing saidin, Rand channeled, wove flows of Air that snatched Natael up from the cushions;
the gilded harp tumbled to the dark red tiles as the man was pinned against the wall, immobile from
neck to ankles and his feet half a pace above the floor. “I’ve warned you! Never channel when anyone
else is around. Never!”
Natael tilted his head in that peculiar way he had, as if trying to look at Rand sideways, or watch
without being noticed. “If she had seen, she would have thought it was you.” There was no apology in
his voice, no diffidence, but no challenge either; he seemed to think he was offering a reasonable
explanation. “Besides, you looked thirsty. A court-bard should look after his lord’s needs.” That was
one of the small conceits he surrounded himself with; if Rand was the Lord Dragon, then he himself
must be a court-bard, not a simple gleeman.
Feeling disgusted with himself as much as angry at the man, Rand unraveled the weave and let
him drop. Manhandling him was like picking a fight with a boy of ten. He could not see the shield that
constricted the other man’s access to saidin—it was female work—but he knew it was there. Moving
a goblet was about the extent of Natael’s ability, now. Luckily the shield had been hidden from female
eyes, too. Natael called the trick “inverting”; he did not seem able to explain it, though. “And if she’d
seen my face and was suspicious? I was as startled as if that goblet had flown at me by itself!” He
stuck his pipe back between his teeth and sent up furious streams of smoke.
“She still wouldn’t suspect.” Settling back onto the cushions, the other man took up the harp
again, strumming a line of music that had a devious sound. “How could anyone suspect? I do not
entirely believe the situation myself.” If there was even a touch of bitterness in his voice, Rand could
not detect it.
He was not entirely sure he believed it either, though he had worked hard enough for it. The man
in front of him, Jasin Natael, had another name. Asmodean.
Idly playing the harp, Asmodean did not look like one of the dreaded Forsaken. He was even
moderately handsome; Rand supposed he would be attractive to women. It often seemed strange that
evil had left no outward mark. He was one of the Forsaken, and far from trying to kill him, Rand hid
what he was from Moiraine and everyone else. He needed a teacher.
If what was true for the women Aes Sedai called “wilders” also held for men, he had only one
chance in four of surviving the attempt to learn to use the Power on his own. That was discounting the
madness. His teacher had to be a man; Moiraine and others had told him often enough that a bird
could not teach a fish to fly, nor a fish a bird to swim. And his teacher had to be someone
experienced, someone who already knew all the things he needed to learn. With Aes Sedai gentling
men who could channel as soon as they were found—and fewer were found every year—that left

small choices. A man who had simply discovered he could channel would know no more than he did.
A false Dragon who could channel—if Rand could find one not already caught and gentled—would
not be likely to give up his own dreams of glory for another claiming to be the Dragon Reborn. What
remained, what Rand had lured to him, was one of the Forsaken.
Asmodean plucked random chords as Rand took a seat on a cushion facing him. It was well to
remember that the man had not changed, not inside, from the day so long ago when he had pledged his
soul to the Shadow. What he did now, he did under duress; he had not come to the Light. “Do you
ever think of turning back, Natael?” He was always careful of the name; one breath of “Asmodean,”
and Moiraine would be sure he had gone over to the Shadow. Moiraine and maybe others. Neither he
nor Asmodean might survive that.
The man’s hands froze on the strings, his face utterly blank. “Turn back? Demandred, Rahvin,
any of them would kill me on sight, now. If I was lucky. Except Lanfear perhaps, and you will
understand if I don’t want to put her to the test. Semirhage could make a boulder beg for mercy and
thank her for death. And as for the Great Lord—”
“The Dark One,” Rand broke in sharply around his pipestem. The Great Lord of the Dark was
what Darkfriends called the Dark One. Darkfriends and the Forsaken.
Asmodean bowed his head briefly in acquiescence. “When the Dark One breaks free . . .” If his
face had been expressionless before, now it was bleak in every line. “Suffice it to say that I will find
Semirhage and give myself to her before I’ll face the—the Dark One’s punishment for betrayal.”
“As well you are here to teach me, then.”
Mournful music began to flow from the harp, speaking of loss and tears. “ ‘The March of Death,’
” Asmodean said over the music, “the final movement of The Grand Passions Cycle, composed some
three hundred years before the War of Power by—”
Rand cut him off. “You are not teaching me very well.”
“As well as may be expected, under the circumstances. You can grasp saidin every time you try,
now, and tell one flow from another. You can shield yourself, and the Power does what you want it
to.” He stopped playing and frowned, not looking at Rand. “Do you think Lanfear really intended me
to teach you everything? If she had wanted that, she would have contrived to stay close so she could
link us. She wants you to live, Lews Therin; but this time she means to be stronger than you.”
“Don’t call me that!” Rand snapped, but Asmodean did not seem to hear.
“If you planned this between you—trapping me—” Rand sensed a surge in Asmodean, as if the
Forsaken were testing the shield Lanfear had woven around him; women who could channel saw a
glow surrounding another woman who had embraced saidar and felt her channeling clearly, but he
never saw anything around Asmodean and felt little. “If you worked it out together, then you let her
outfox you on more levels than one. I’ve told you I am not a very good teacher, especially without a
link. You did plan it between you, didn’t you?” He did look at Rand then, sidelong but still intent.
“How much do you remember? Of being Lews Therin, I mean. She said you recalled nothing at all,
but she could lie to the Gr—the Dark One himself.”
“This time she spoke the truth.” Seating himself on one of the cushions, Rand channeled one of
the clan chiefs’ untouched silver goblets to him. Even such a brief touch of saidin was exhilarating—
and fouling. And hard to release. He did not want to talk about Lews Therin; he was tired of people
thinking he was Lews Therin. The bowl of his pipe had grown hot with all the puffing, so he held it by
the stem and gestured with it. “If linking will help you teach me, why don’t we link?”
Asmodean looked at him as if he had asked why they did not eat rocks, then shook his head. “I
continually forget how much you don’t know. You and I cannot. Not without a woman to join us. You

could ask Moiraine, I suppose, or the girl Egwene. One of them might be able to reason out the
method. So long as you don’t mind them finding out who I am.”
“Don’t lie to me, Natael,” Rand growled. Well before meeting Natael he had learned that a
man’s channeling and a woman’s were as different as men and women themselves, but he took little
the man said on trust. “I’ve heard Egwene and others talk about Aes Sedai linking their powers. If
they can do it, why not you and I?”
“Because we can’t.” Exasperation filled Asmodean’s tone. “Ask a philosopher if you want to
know why. Why can’t dogs fly? Perhaps in the grand scheme of the Pattern, it’s a balance for men
being stronger. We cannot link without them, but they can without us. Up to thirteen of them can,
anyway, a small mercy; after that, they need men to make the circle larger.”
Rand was sure he had caught a lie, this time. Moiraine said that in the Age of Legends men and
women had been equally strong in the Power, and she could not lie. He said as much, adding, “The
Five Powers are equal.”
“Earth, Fire, Air, Water, and Spirit.” Natael strummed a chord for each. “They are equal, true,
and it is also true that what a man can do with one, a woman can also. In kind, at least. But that has
nothing to do with men being stronger. What Moiraine believes to be truth, she tells as truth whether
or not it is; one of a thousand weaknesses in those fool Oaths.” He played a bit of something that did
indeed sound foolish. “Some women have stronger arms than some men, but in general it is the other
way around. The same holds with strength in the Power, and in about the same proportion.”
Rand nodded slowly. It did make a kind of sense. Elayne and Egwene were considered two of
the strongest women to train in the Tower for a thousand years or more, but he had tested himself
against them once, and later Elayne had confessed that she felt like a kitten seized by a mastiff.
Asmodean was not finished. “If two women link, they do not double their strength—linking is
not as simple as adding together the power of each—but if they are strong enough, they can match a
man. And when they take the circle to thirteen, then you must be wary. Thirteen women who can
barely channel could overpower most men, linked. The thirteen weakest women in the Tower could
overpower you or any man, and barely breathe hard. I came across a saying in Arad Doman. ‘The
more women there are about, the softer a wise man steps.’ It would not be bad to remember it.”
Rand shivered, thinking of a time when he had been among many more than thirteen Aes Sedai.
Of course, most of them had not known who he was. If they had . . . If Egwene and Moiraine linked
. . . He did not want to believe Egwene had gone that far toward the Tower and away from their
friendship. Whatever she does, she does with her whole heart, and she’s becoming Aes Sedai. So is
Elayne.
Swallowing half his wine did not completely wash the thought away. “What more can you tell
me about the Forsaken?” It was a question he was sure he had asked a hundred times, but he always
hoped there was a scrap more to dig out. Better than thinking about Moiraine and Egwene linking to
...
“I have told everything I know.” Asmodean sighed heavily. “We were hardly close friends at the
best. Do you believe I am holding back something? I don’t know where the others are, if that is what
you want. Except Sammael, and you knew he’d taken Illian for his kingdom before I told you.
Graendal was in Arad Doman for a time, but I expect she has gone now; she likes her comforts too
well. I suspect Moghedien is or was in the west somewhere as well, but no one ever finds the Spider
unless she wants to be found. Rahvin has a queen for one of his pets, but your guess is as good as
mine as to what country she rules for him. And that is all I know that might help locate them.”
Rand had heard all that before; it seemed he had heard all Asmodean had to say of the Forsaken

fifty times already. So often that at moments it seemed he had always known what the man was telling
him. Some of it he almost wished he had never learned—what Semirhage found amusing, for instance
—and some made no sense. Demandred had gone over to the Shadow because he envied Lews Therin
Telamon? Rand could not imagine envying someone enough to do anything because of it, and surely
not that. Asmodean claimed it had been the thought of immortality, of endless Ages of music, that had
seduced him; he claimed to have been a noted composer of music, before. Senseless. Yet in that mass
of often blood-chilling knowledge might lie keys to surviving Tarmon Gai’don. Whatever he told
Moiraine, he knew he would have to face them then, if not before. Emptying the goblet, he set it on the
floor tiles. Wine would not wash out facts.
The bead curtain rattled, and he looked over his shoulder as gai’shain entered, white-robed and
silent. While some began gathering up the food and drink that had been laid out for him and the chiefs,
another, a man, carried a large silver tray to the table. On it were covered dishes, a silver cup, and
two large, green-striped pottery pitchers. One would hold wine, the other water. A gai’shain woman
brought in a gilded lamp, already lit, and set it beside the tray. Through the windows, the sky was
beginning to take on the yellow-red of sunset; in the brief time between baking and freezing, the air
actually felt comfortable.
Rand stood as the gai’shain departed, but did not follow immediately. “What do you think of my
chances when the Last Battle comes, Natael?”
Asmodean hesitated in pulling red-and-blue-striped wool blankets from behind his cushions and
looked up at him, head tilted in that sideways manner of his. “You found . . . something . . . in the
square the day we met here.”
“Forget that,” Rand said harshly. There had been two, not one. “I destroyed it, in any case.” He
thought Asmodean’s shoulders slumped a trifle.
“Then the—Dark One—will consume you alive. As for me, I intend to open my veins the hour I
know he is free. If I get the chance. A quick death is better than what I’ll find elsewhere.” He tossed
the blankets aside and sat staring glumly at nothing. “Better than going mad, certainly. I’m as subject
to that as you, now. You broke the bonds that protected me.” There was no bitterness in his voice,
only hopelessness.
“What if there was another way to shield against the taint?” Rand demanded. “What if it could
be removed somehow? Would you still kill yourself then?”
Asmodean’s barked laugh was utterly acid. “The Shadow take me, you must be beginning to
think you really are the bloody Creator! We are dead. Both of us. Dead! Are you too blind with pride
to see it? Or just too thick-witted, you hopeless shepherd?”
Rand refused to be drawn. “Then why not go ahead and end it?” he asked in a tight voice. I
wasn’t too blind to see what you and Lanfear were up to. I wasn’t too thick-witted to fool her and
trap you. “If there’s no hope, no chance, not the smallest shred . . . then why are you still alive?”
Still not looking at him, Asmodean rubbed the side of his nose. “I once saw a man hanging from
a cliff,” he said slowly. “The brink was crumbling under his fingers, and the only thing near enough to
grasp was a tuft of grass, a few long blades with roots barely clinging to the rock. The only chance he
had of climbing back up on the cliff. So he grabbed it.” His abrupt chuckle held no mirth. “He had to
know it would pull free.”
“Did you save him?” Rand asked, but Asmodean did not answer.
As Rand started for the doorway, the sounds of “The March of Death” began again behind him.
The strings of beads fell together behind him, and the five Maidens who had been waiting in the
wide, empty hall flowed easily to their feet from where they had been squatting on the pale blue tiles.

They were all but one tall for women, though not for Aielwomen. Their leader, Adelin, lacked little
more than a hand of being able to look him in the eyes. The exception, a fiery redhead named Enaila,
was no taller than Egwene, and extremely touchy about being so short. Like the clan chiefs’, their eyes
were all blue or gray or green, and their hair, light brown or yellow or red, was cut short except for a
tail at the nape of the neck. Full quivers balanced the long-bladed knives at their belts, and they wore
cased horn bows on their backs. Each carried three or four short, long-bladed spears and a round,
bull-hide buckler. Aielwomen who did not want hearth and children had their own warrior society,
Far Dareis Mai, the Maidens of the Spear.
He acknowledged them with a small bow, which made them smile; it was not an Aiel custom, at
least not the way he had been taught to do it. “I see you, Adelin,” he said. “Where is Joinde? I thought
she was with you earlier. Has she taken ill?”
“I see you, Rand al’Thor,” she replied. Her pale yellow hair seemed paler framing her sun-dark
face, which had a fine white scar across one cheek. “In a way she has. She had been talking to herself
all day, and not an hour ago, she went off to lay a bridal wreath at the feet of Garan, of the Jhirad
Goshien.” Some of the others shook their heads; marrying meant giving up the spear. “Tomorrow is
his last day as her gai’shain. Joinde is Black Rock Shaarad,” she added significantly. It was
significant; marriages came frequently with men or women taken gai’shain, but very seldom between
clans with blood feud, even blood feud in abeyance.
“It is an illness that spreads,” Enaila said heatedly. Her voice was usually as hot as her hair.
“One or two Maidens make their bridal wreaths every day since we came to Rhuidean.”
Rand nodded with what he hoped they took for sympathy. It was his fault. If he told them, he
wondered how many would still risk staying near him. All, probably; honor would hold them, and
they had no more fear than the clan chiefs. At least it was only marriages, so far; even Maidens would
think marrying better than what some had experienced. Maybe they would. “I will be ready to go in a
moment,” he told them.
“We will wait with patience,” Adelin said. It hardly seemed patience; standing there, they all
appeared poised on the edge of sudden movement.
It really did take him only a moment to do what he wanted, weave flows of Spirit and Fire into a
box around the room and tie them so the weave held on its own. Anyone could go in or out—except a
man who could channel. For himself—or Asmodean—walking through that doorway would be like
walking through a wall of solid flame. He had discovered the weave—and that Asmodean, blocked,
was too weak to channel through it—by accident. No one was likely to question the doings of a
gleeman, but if someone did, Jasin Natael had simply chosen to sleep as far from Aiel as he could
manage in Rhuidean. That was a choice that Hadnan Kadere’s drivers and guards, at least, could
sympathize with. And this way Rand knew exactly where the man was of a night. The Maidens asked
him no questions.
He turned away. The Maidens followed him, spread out and wary as if they expected an attack
right there. Asmodean was still playing the lament.
Arms outstretched to either side, Mat Cauthon walked the wide white coping of the dry fountain,
singing to the men who watched him in the fading light.
“We’ll drink the wine till the cup is dry,
and kiss the girls so they’ll not cry,
and toss the dice until we fly

to dance with Jak o’ the Shadows.”
The air felt cool after the day’s heat, and he thought briefly of buttoning up his fine green silk
coat with the golden embroidery, but the drink the Aiel called oosquai had put a buzz in his head like
giant flies, and the thought flittered away. The white stone figures of three women stood on a platform
in the dusty basin, twenty feet tall and unclothed. Each had been made with one hand upraised, the
other holding a huge stone jar tilted over her shoulder for water to pour from, but one was missing her
head and upraised hand, and on another the jar was a shattered ruin.
“We’ll dance all night while the moon runs free,
and dandle the lasses upon our knee,
and then you’ll ride along with me,
to dance with Jak o’ the Shadows.”
“A fine song to be singing about death,” one of the wagon drivers shouted in a heavy Lugarder
accent. Kadere’s men kept themselves in a tight knot apart from the Aielmen around the fountain; they
were all tough, hard-faced men, but every one was sure any Aiel would slit his throat for a wrong
glance. They were not far wrong. “I heard my old grandmother talk about Jak o’ the Shadows,” the
big-eared Lugarder went on. “ ’Tisn’t right to sing about death that way.”
Mat muzzily considered the song he had been singing and grimaced. No one had heard “Dance
with Jak o’ the Shadows” since Aldeshar fell; in his head, he could still hear the defiant song rising
as the Golden Lions launched their last, futile charge at Artur Hawkwing’s encircling army. At least
he had not been babbling it in the Old Tongue. He was not as juicy as he looked by half, but there had
indeed been too many cups of oosquai. The stuff looked and tasted like brown water, but it hit your
head like a mule’s kick. Moiraine will pack me off to the Tower yet, if I’m not careful. At least it
would get me out of the Waste and away from Rand. Maybe he was drunker than he thought, if he
considered that a fair trade. He shifted to “Tinker in the Kitchen.”
“Tinker in the kitchen, with a job of work to do.
Mistress up above, slipping on a robe of blue.
She dances down the staircase, her fancy all so free,
crying, Tinker, oh, dear Tinker, won’t you mend a pot for me?”
Some of Kadere’s men joined in the song as he danced back to where he had begun. The Aiel
did not; among them, men did not sing except for battle chants or laments for the slain, and neither did
Maidens, except among themselves.
Two Aielmen were squatting on the coping, showing none of the effects of the oosquai they had
consumed, unless their eyes were the faintest bit glassy. He would be glad to get back where lightcolored eyes were a rarity; growing up, he had not seen anything but brown or black except on Rand.
A few pieces of wood—wormholed arms and legs from chairs—lay on the broad paving stones,
in the area left open by the watchers. An empty red pottery crock lay beside the coping, as did another
that still held oosquai, and a silver cup. The game was to take a drink, then try to hit a target thrown
into the air with a knife. None of Kadere’s men and few of the Aiel would dice with him, not when he
won as often as he did, and they did not play at cards. Knife throwing was supposed to be different,
especially with oosquai added in. He had not won as often as he did with dice, but half a dozen
worked gold cups and two bowls lay inside the basin beneath him, along with bracelets and

necklaces set with rubies or moonstones or sapphires, and a scattering of coins as well. His flatcrowned hat and an odd spear with a black haft rested beside his winnings. Some of it was even Aiel
made. They were more likely to pay for something with a piece of loot than with a coin.
Corman, one of the Aiel on the coping, looked up at him as he cut off singing. A white scar
slanted across his nose. “You are nearly as good with knives as you are with dice, Matrim Cauthon.
Shall we call it an end? The light is failing.”
“There’s plenty of light.” Mat squinted at the sky; pale shadows covered everything here in the
valley of Rhuidean, but the sky was still light enough to see against, at least. “My grandmother could
make the throw in this. I could make it blindfolded.”
Jenric, the other squatting Aiel, peered around the onlookers. “Are there women here?” Built
like a bear, he considered himself a wit. “The only time a man talks like that is when there are women
to impress.” The Maidens scattered through the crowd laughed as hard as anyone else, and maybe
harder.
“You think I can’t?” Mat muttered, ripping off the dark scarf he wore around his neck to hide the
scar where he had once been hung. “Just you shout ‘now’ when you throw it up, Corman.” Hastily he
tied the scarf around his eyes and drew one of his knives from his sleeve. The loudest sound was the
watchers breathing. Not drunk? I’m juicier than a fiddler’s whelp. And yet, he suddenly felt his luck,
felt that surge the way he did when he knew which spots would show before the dice stopped
tumbling. It seemed to clear his head a little. “Throw it,” he murmured calmly.
“Now,” Corman called, and Mat’s arm whipped back, then forward.
In the stillness, the thunk of steel stabbing wood was as loud as the clatter of the target on the
pavement.
No one said a word as he pulled the scarf back down around his neck. A piece of a chair arm no
bigger than his hand lay in the open space, his blade stuck firmly in the middle. Corman had tried to
shave the odds, it appeared. Well, he had never specified the target. He suddenly realized he had not
even made a wager.
Finally one of Kadere’s men half-shouted, “The Dark One’s own luck, that!”
“Luck is a horse to ride like any other,” Mat said to himself. No matter where it came from. Not
that he knew where his luck came from; he only tried to ride it as best he could.
As quietly as he had spoken, Jenric frowned up at him. “What was that you said, Matrim
Cauthon?”
Mat opened his mouth to repeat himself, then closed it again as the words came clear in his
mind. Sene sovya caba’donde ain dovienya. The Old Tongue. “Nothing,” he muttered. “Just talking to
myself.” The onlookers were beginning to drift away. “I guess the light really is fading too much to go
on.”
Corman put a foot on the piece of wood to wrench Mat’s knife free and brought it back to him.
“Some time again maybe, Matrim Cauthon, some day.” That was the Aiel way of saying “never” when
they did not want to say it right out.
Mat nodded as he slipped the blade back into one of the sheaths inside his sleeve; it was the
same as the time he had rolled six sixes twenty-three times in a row. He could hardly blame them.
Being lucky was not all it was made out. He noted with a bit of envy that neither Aiel staggered in the
slightest as they joined the departing crowd.
Scrubbing a hand through his hair, Mat sat down heavily on the coping. The memories that had
once cluttered his head like raisins in a cake now blended with his own. In one part of his mind he
knew he had been born in the Two Rivers twenty years before, but he could remember clearly leading

the flanking attack that turned the Trollocs at Maighande, and dancing in the court of Tarmandewin,
and a hundred other things, a thousand. Mostly battles. He remembered dying more times than he
wanted to think of. No seams between lives anymore; he could not tell his memories from the others
unless he concentrated.
Reaching behind him, he set his wide-brimmed hat on his head and fished the odd spear across
his knees. Instead of an ordinary spearhead, it had what looked like a two-foot sword blade, marked
with a pair of ravens. Lan said that that blade had been made with the One Power during the War of
the Shadow, the War of the Power; the Warder claimed it would never need sharpening and never
break. Mat thought he would not trust that unless he had to. It might have lasted three thousand years,
but he had little trust of the Power. Cursive script ran along the black haft, punctuated at either end
with another raven, inlaid in some metal even darker than the wood. In the Old Tongue, but he could
read it now, of course.
Thus is our treaty written; thus is agreement made.
Thought is the arrow of time; memory never fades.
What was asked is given. The price is paid.

One way down the wide street, half a mile off, was a square that would have been called large
in most cities. The Aiel traders were gone for the night, but their pavilions still stood, made of the
same grayish brown wool used for Aiel tents. Hundreds of traders had come to Rhuidean from every
part of the Waste, for the biggest fair the Aiel had ever seen, and more arrived every day. The traders
had been among the first to actually start living in the city.
Mat did not really want to look the other way, toward the great plaza. He could make out the
shapes of Kadere’s wagons, awaiting more loading tomorrow. What appeared to be a twisted
redstone doorframe had been heaved into one that afternoon; Moiraine had taken particular care to
see it lashed firmly in place just as she wanted.
He did not know what she knew of it—and he was not about to ask; better if she forgot he was
alive, though small chance of that—but whatever she knew, he was sure he knew more. He had
stepped through it, a fool looking for answers. What he had gotten instead was a head full of other
men’s memories. That, and dead. He tucked the scarf closer around his neck. And two other things. A
silver foxhead medallion that he wore under his shirt, and the weapon across his knees. Small
recompense. He ran his fingers lightly down the script. Memory never fades. They had a sense of
humor fit for Aiel, those folk on the other side of that doorway.
“Can you do that every time?”
He jerked his head around to stare at the Maiden who had just sat down beside him. Tall even
for an Aiel, maybe taller than he was, she had hair like spun gold and eyes the color of a clear
morning sky. She was older than he, maybe by ten years, but that had never put him off. Then again,
she was Far Dareis Mai.
“I am Melindhra,” she went on, “of the Jumai sept. Can you do that every time?”
She meant the knife throwing, he realized. She gave her sept, but no clan. Aiel never did that.
Unless . . . She had to be one of the Shaido Maidens who had come to join Rand. He did not really
understand all this about societies, but as for Shaido, he remembered them trying to stick spears in
him too well. Couladin did not like anyone associated with Rand, and what Couladin hated, the
Shaido hated. On the other hand, Melindhra had come here to Rhuidean. A Maiden. But she wore a
small smile; her gaze held an inviting light.

“Most of the time,” he said truthfully. Even when he did not feel it, his luck was good; when he
did, it was perfect. She chuckled, her smile widening, as if she thought he was boasting. Women
seemed to make up their minds whether you were lying without looking at the evidence. On the other
hand, if they liked you, they either did not care or else decided even the most outrageous lie was true.
Maidens could be dangerous, whatever their clan—any woman could; he had learned that on his
own—but Melindhra’s eyes were definitely not just looking at him.
Dipping into his winnings, he pulled up a necklace of gold spirals, each centered on a deep blue
sapphire, the largest as big as the joint of his thumb. He could remember a time—his own memory—
when the smallest of those stones would have made him sweat.
“They’ll look pretty with your eyes,” he said, laying the heavy strand in her hands. He had never
seen a Maiden wear baubles of any sort, but in his experience, every woman liked jewelry. Strangely,
they liked flowers nearly as well. He did not understand it, but then, he was willing to admit that he
understood women less than he did his luck, or what had happened on the other side of that twisted
doorway.
“Very fine work,” she said, holding it up. “I accept your offer.” The necklace disappeared into
her belt pouch, and she leaned over to push his hat back on his head. “Your eyes are pretty. Like dark
polished catseye.” She twisted around to pull her feet up onto the coping and sat with her arms
wrapped around her knees, studying him intently. “My spear sisters have told me about you.”
Mat pulled his hat back into place and watched her warily from under the brim. What had they
told her? And what “offer”? It was only a necklace. The invitation was gone from her eyes; she
looked like a cat studying a mouse. That was the trouble with Maidens of the Spear. Sometimes it was
hard to tell whether they wanted to dance with you, kiss you, or kill you.
The street was emptying, the shadows deepening, but he recognized Rand slanting across down
the way, pipe clenched between his teeth. He was the only man in Rhuidean likely to be walking with
a fistful of Far Dareis Mai. They’re always around him, Mat thought. Guarding him like a pack of
she-wolves, leaping to do whatever he says. Some men might have envied him that much, at least.
Not Mat. Not most of the time. If it had been a pack of girls like Isendre, now . . .
“Excuse me for a moment,” he told Melindhra hurriedly. Leaning his spear against the low wall
around the fountain, he leaped up already running. His head still buzzed, but not so loudly as before,
and he did not stagger. He had no worries about his winnings. The Aiel had very definite views of
what was allowed: taking in a raid was one thing, theft another. Kadere’s men had learned to keep
their hands in their pockets after one of them had been caught stealing. After a beating that left him
striped from shoulders to heels, he had been sent away. The one water bag he had been allowed
would not have been nearly enough for him to reach the Dragonwall, even if he had had any clothes
on. Now Kadere’s men would not pick up a copper they found lying in the street.
“Rand?” The other man walked on with his encircling escort. “Rand?” Rand was not even ten
paces away, but he did not waver. Some of the Maidens looked back, but not Rand. Mat felt cold
suddenly, and it had nothing to do with the onset of night. He wet his lips and spoke again, not a shout.
“Lews Therin.” And Rand turned around. Mat almost wished he had not.
For a time they only looked at one another in the twilight. Mat hesitated about going closer. He
tried telling himself it was because of the Maidens. Adelin had been one of those who taught him a
so-called game, Maidens’ Kiss, that he was never likely to forget; or play again, if he had any say in
it. And he could feel Enaila’s gaze like an auger boring into his skull. Who would have expected a
woman to go up like oil thrown on a fire just because you told her she was the prettiest little flower
you had ever seen?

Rand, now. He and Rand had grown up together. They and Perrin, the blacksmith’s apprentice
back in Emond’s Field, had hunted together, fished together, tramped through the Sand Hills to the
edge of the Mountains of Mist, camped under the stars. Rand was his friend. Only now he was the
kind of friend who might bash your head in without meaning to. Perrin could be dead, because of
Rand.
He made himself walk to arm’s reach of the other man. Rand was nearly a head taller, and in the
early-evening gloom he seemed taller yet. Colder than he had been. “I’ve been thinking, Rand.” Mat
wished he did not sound hoarse. He hoped Rand would answer to his right name this time. “I’ve been
away from home a long time.”
“We both have,” Rand said softly. “A long time.” Suddenly he gave a laugh, not loud, but almost
like the old Rand. “Are you beginning to miss milking your father’s cows?”
Mat scratched his ear, grinning a bit. “Not that, exactly.” If he never saw the inside of another
barn it would be too soon. “But I was thinking that when Kadere’s wagons go, I might go with them.”
Rand was silent. When he spoke again, the brief flash of mirth was gone. “All the way to Tar
Valon?”
It was Mat’s turn to hesitate. He wouldn’t give me away to Moiraine. Would he? “Maybe,” he
said casually. “I don’t know. That’s where Moiraine will want me. Maybe I’ll find a chance to get
back to the Two Rivers. See if everything’s all right at home.” See if Perrin’s alive. See if my sisters
are, and Mother and Da.
“We all have to do what we must, Mat. Not what we want to, very often. What we must.”
It sounded like an excuse, to Mat, as if Rand was asking him to understand. Only, he had done
what he had to himself a few times. I can’t blame Perrin on him, not by himself. Nobody bloody
forced me to follow after Rand like some bloody heelhound! Only that was not true, either. He had
been forced. Just not by Rand. “You won’t—stop me leaving?”
“I don’t try to tell you to come or go, Mat,” Rand said wearily. “The Wheel weaves the Pattern,
not me, and the Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills.” For all the world like a bloody Aes Sedai! Half
turning to go, Rand added, “Don’t trust Kadere, Mat. In some ways he’s about as dangerous a man as
you ever met. Don’t trust him an inch, or you might get your throat slit, and you and I wouldn’t be the
only ones to regret that.” Then he was gone, down the street in the deepening dusk, with the Maidens
around him like slinking wolves.
Mat stared after him. Trust the merchant? I wouldn’t trust Kadere if he was tied in a sack. So
Rand did not weave the Pattern? He came close! Before ever any of them learned that the Prophecies
had anything to do with them, they had learned that Rand was ta’veren, one of those rare individuals
who, instead of being woven willy-nilly into the Pattern, instead forced the Pattern to shape itself
around them. Mat knew about being ta’veren; he was one himself, though not as strong as Rand.
Sometimes Rand could affect people’s lives, change the course of them, just by being in the same
town. Perrin was ta’veren as well—or maybe had been. Moiraine had thought it was significant,
finding three young men who grew up in the same village, all destined to be ta’veren. She meant to fit
them all into her plans, whatever they were.
It was supposed to be a grand thing; all the ta’veren Mat had been able to learn about had been
men like Artur Hawkwing, or women like Mabriam en Shereed, who stories said had founded the
Compact of the Ten Nations after the Breaking. But none of the stories told what happened when one
ta’veren was close to another as strong as Rand. It was like being a leaf in a whirlpool.
Melindhra stopped beside him and handed him his spear and a heavy, coarse-woven sack that
clinked. “I put your winnings in this for you.” She was taller than he was, by a good two inches. She

glanced after Rand. “I had heard you were near-brother to Rand al’Thor.”
“In a manner of speaking,” he said dryly.
“It does not matter,” she said dismissively, and concentrated her gaze on him, fists on her hips.
“You attracted my interest, Mat Cauthon, before you gave me a regard-gift. Not that I will give up the
spear for you, of course, but I have had my eye on you for days. You have a smile like a boy about to
do mischief. I like that. And those eyes.” In the failing light her grin was slow and wide. And warm.
“I do like your eyes.”
Mat tugged his hat straight, though it had not been crooked. From pursuer to pursued, in the blink
of an eye. It could happen like that, with Aiel women. Especially Maidens. “Does ‘Daughter of the
Nine Moons’ mean anything to you?” It was a question he asked women sometimes. The wrong
answer would send him out of Rhuidean tonight if he had to try walking out of the Waste.
“Nothing,” she said. “But there are things I like to do by moonlight.” Putting an arm around his
shoulder, she took off his hat and began to whisper in his ear. In no time at all he was grinning even
more widely than she.

CHAPTER
4

Twilight

With his Far Dareis Mai escort, Rand approached the Rhuidean Roof of the Maidens. White
stairs as wide as the tall building, each step a stride deep, ran up to thick columns twenty paces high,
black-seeming in the twilight but bright blue by day, and fluted in spirals. The outside of the building
was a patterned mosaic of glazed tiles, white and blue in spirals that appeared endless to the eye, and
a huge window of colored glass directly above the columns showed a black-haired woman fifteen
feet tall, in complicated blue robes, right hand upraised, either to bless or command a halt. Her face
was serene and stern at the same time. Whoever she had been, she was surely no Aiel, not with that
pale skin and those dark eyes. An Aes Sedai, perhaps. He tapped his pipe out on his bootheel and
stuffed it into his coat pocket before starting up the steps.
Except for gai’shain, men were not allowed beneath a Roof of the Maidens, not any man, not in
any hold in the Waste. A chief or a Maiden’s blood kin could die trying, though in fact no Aielman
would ever think of it. It was the same for any society; only members and the gai’shain were allowed
inside.
The two Maidens standing guard at the tall bronze doors flashed Maiden handtalk at one another,
cutting their eyes in his direction as he came through the columns, then shared a small grin. He wished
he knew what they had said. Even in as dry a land as the Waste, bronze would tarnish with enough
time, but gai’shain had polished these doors until they looked new-made. They stood wide open, and
the pair of guards made no move to hinder him as he walked through, Adelin and the others on his
heels.
The wide, white-tiled corridors and great rooms inside were full of Maidens, sitting about on
bright cushions, talking, tending to weapons, playing cat’s cradle, or stones, or Thousand Flowers, an
Aiel game that involved laying out patterns of flat bits of stone carved with what seemed a hundred
different symbols. Of course, a profusion of gai’shain moved smoothly about their chores, cleaning,
serving, mending, seeing to oil lamps that ranged from simple glazed pottery to gilded loot from
somewhere to the tall stand-lamps that had been found in the city. In most rooms, colorful carpets and
bright tapestries covered the floors and walls, in nearly as many patterns and styles as there were
carpets and tapestries. The walls and ceilings themselves were detailed mosaics, of forests and
rivers and skies that had never been seen in the Waste.
Young or old, the Maidens smiled when they saw him, and some nodded familiarly or even
patted his shoulder. Others called out, asking how he was, had he eaten, would he like the gai’shain
to bring him wine or water? He responded briefly, though with answering smiles. He was well, and
neither hungry nor thirsty. He kept walking, not even slowing when he spoke. Slowing would lead
inevitably to stopping, and he was not up to that tonight.
Far Dareis Mai had adopted him, after a fashion. Some treated him as a son, others as a brother.

Age seemed not to come into it; women with white in their hair might talk to him as a brother over
tea, while Maidens no more than a year older than he tried to make sure he wore the proper clothes
for the heat. There was no avoiding the mothering; they simply did it, and he could not see how to
make them stop, short of using the Power against the whole lot of them.
He had thought of trying to have another society provide his guards—Shae’en M’taal, the Stone
Dogs, perhaps, or Aethan Dor, the Red Shields; Rhuarc had been a Red Shield before becoming chief
—only, what reason could he possibly give? Not the truth, certainly. Just thinking about explaining
that to Rhuarc and the others made him uncomfortable; Aiel humor being what it was, even sour old
Han would likely break his ribs laughing. Any reason at all would probably offend the honor of every
last Maiden. At least they rarely mothered him except under the Roof, where there was no one to see
but themselves, and gai’shain who knew better than to speak of anything that happened there. “The
Maidens,” he had once said, “carry my honor.” Everyone remembered that, and the Maidens were as
proud of it as if he had given them all thrones. But it had turned out that they carried it in a manner
they chose.
Adelin and the other four left him to join their friends, but he was hardly alone as he climbed
higher in the building, along curving flights of wide white stairs. He had to answer the same questions
at practically every step. No, he was not hungry. Yes, he knew he was not used to the heat yet, and no,
he had not spent too much time in the sun. He bore it all patiently, but he did heave a sigh of relief
when he reached the second story above the huge window. Here there were no Maidens and no
gai’shain in the broad hallways or on the stairs that led on upward. The bare walls and empty
chambers emphasized the absence of people, but after traversing the floors below, he found solitude a
blessing.
His bedroom was a windowless chamber near the center of the building, one of the few that was
not huge, though its ceiling still reached high enough to make height the room’s longest dimension.
What it had been meant for originally, he had no idea; a mosaic of vines around the small fireplace
was the only ornamentation. A servant’s room, he would have said, but servants’ rooms did not have
a door sheathed in bronze, however plain, that he pushed most of the way shut. Gai’shain had
polished the metal to a dull gleam. A few tasseled cushions lay scattered on the blue floor tiles for
sitting, and a thick pallet, atop bright layered rugs, for sleeping. A simple blue-glazed pitcher of
water and a dark green cup sat on the floor near the “bed.” That was it, except for two three-pronged
stand-lamps, already lit, and a pace-high pile of books in one corner. With a tired sigh, he lay down
on the pallet still in his coat and boots; no matter how he shifted it was not much softer than sleeping
on the bare floor.
The night’s chill was already seeping into the room, but he did not bother to light the dried cow
dung on the hearth; he was readier to face the cold than the smell. Asmodean had tried to show him a
simple way to keep the room warm; simple, but something the man did not have enough strength to do
himself. The one time Rand had tried it, he had awakened in the middle of the night, gasping for
breath while the edges of the rugs smoldered from the heat of the floor. He had not made another
attempt.
He had chosen this building for his quarters because it was whole and near to the plaza; its great
high ceilings gave a semblance of coolness even to the hottest part of the day, and its thick walls kept
out the worst of the cold at night. It had not been the Roof of the Maidens then, of course. One morning
he simply awakened to find it so, Maidens in every room on the first two floors and their guards on
the doors. It had taken him a while to realize that they intended the building for their society’s Roof in
Rhuidean, yet expected him to continue to stay in it. In fact, they were ready to move the Roof

wherever he went. That was why he had to meet the clan chiefs elsewhere. The best he had been able
to manage was to make the Maidens agree to stay below the floor where he slept; that had amused
them all no end. Even the Car’a’carn is not a king, he reminded himself wryly. Twice already he had
moved upward as the numbers of Maidens increased. Idly he tried to calculate how many more could
come in before he was sleeping on the roof.
That was better than remembering how he had let Moiraine get under his skin. He had not meant
her to learn his plans until the day the Aiel moved. She knew exactly how to manipulate his emotions,
how to make him so angry that he said more than he wanted to. I never used to get so angry. Why is it
so hard to hold on to my temper? Well, there was nothing she could do to stop him. He did not think
there was. He had to remember to be careful around her. His increasing abilities occasionally made
him careless toward her, but if he was far stronger, she still knew more than he, even with
Asmodean’s teaching.
In a way, letting Asmodean know his plans was less important than revealing his intentions to the
Aes Sedai. To Moiraine I’m still just a shepherd she can use for the Tower’s ends, but to
Asmodean I’m the only branch he can hold on to in a flood. Strange to think he could probably trust
one of the Forsaken more than he could Moiraine. Not that he could trust either very far. Asmodean. If
his bonds to the Dark One had shielded him from the taint on saidin, there had to be another way to do
it. Or to cleanse it.
The trouble was that before they went over to the Shadow, the Forsaken had been among the
most powerful Aes Sedai in the Age of Legends, when things the White Tower never dreamed of
were commonplace. If Asmodean did not know a way, it probably did not exist. It has to. There has
to be something. I’m not going to just sit until I go mad and die.
That was plain foolish. Prophecy had made a rendezvous for him at Shayol Ghul. When, he did
not know; but afterward, he would not have to worry about going mad any longer. He shivered and
thought about unfolding his blankets.
The faint sound of soft-soled footsteps in the hall snapped him upright. I told them! If they can’t
. . . ! The woman who pushed open the door, her arms full of thick wool blankets, was not anyone he
expected.
Aviendha paused just inside the room to regard him with cool, blue-green eyes. A more than
pretty woman, of an age with him, she had been a Maiden until she gave up the spear to become a
Wise One, not very long ago. Her dark reddish hair still came well short of her shoulders and hardly
needed the folded brown scarf to keep it out of her face. She seemed a bit awkward with her brown
shawl, a bit impatient with her full gray skirts.
He felt a stab of jealousy at the silver necklace she wore, an elaborate string of intricately
worked discs, each different. Who gave her that? She would not have chosen it herself; she did not
seem to like jewelry. The only other piece she wore was a wide ivory bracelet, carved in finely
detailed roses. He had given her that, and he was not sure she had forgiven him for it yet. It was
foolish of him to be jealous in any case.
“I haven’t seen you in ten days,” he said. “I thought the Wise Ones would have tied you to my
arm once they found out I’d blocked them out of my dreams.” Asmodean had been amused at the first
thing he’d wanted to learn, and then frustrated at how long Rand took to learn it.
“I have my training to do, Rand al’Thor.” She would be one of the few Wise Ones who could
channel; that was part of what she was being taught. “I am not one of your wetlander women, to stand
about so you can look at me whenever you wish.” Despite knowing Egwene, and Elayne for that
matter, she had an oddly wrongheaded view of what she called wetlander women, and of wetlanders

in general. “They are not pleased at what you have done.” She meant Amys, Bair and Melaine, the
three Wise One dreamwalkers who were teaching her, and trying to watch him. Aviendha shook her
head ruefully. “They were especially not pleased that I had let you know they were walking your
dreams.”
He stared at her. “You told them? But you didn’t really say anything. I figured it out myself, and I
would have eventually even if you hadn’t let a hint slip out. Aviendha, they told me they could speak
to people in their dreams. It was only a step from that.”
“Would you have had me dishonor myself further?” Her voice was level enough, but her eyes
could have started the fire laid on the hearth. “I will not dishonor myself for you or any man! I gave
you the trail to follow, and I will not deny my shame. I should have let you freeze.” She threw the
blankets right on top of his head.
He pulled them off and laid them beside him on the pallet while trying to think of what to say. It
was ji’e’toh again. The woman was as prickly as a thornbush. Supposedly she had been given the
task of teaching him Aiel customs, but he knew her true job, to spy on him for the Wise Ones.
Whatever dishonor was attached to spying among Aiel, apparently it did not extend to the Wise Ones.
They knew he knew, but for some reason it did not seem to concern them, and as long as they were
willing to let matters remain as they were, so was he. For one thing, Aviendha was not a very good
spy; she almost never tried to find anything out, and her own temper got in the way of making him
angry or guilty the way Moiraine did. For another, she was actually pleasant company sometimes,
when she forgot to keep her thorns out. At least he knew who it was that Amys and the others had set
to watch him; if it was not she, it would be someone else, and he would be constantly wondering
who. Besides, she was never wary around him.
Mat, Egwene, even Moiraine sometimes looked at him with eyes that saw the Dragon Reborn, or
at least the danger of a man who could channel. The clan chiefs and the Wise Ones saw He Who
Comes With the Dawn, the man prophesied to break the Aiel like dried twigs; if they did not fear him,
they still sometimes treated him like a red adder they had to live with. Whatever Aviendha saw, it
never stopped her being scathing whenever she chose, which was most of the time.
An odd sort of comfort, but compared to the rest, it was a comfort nonetheless. He had missed
her. He had even picked flowers from some of the spiny plants around Rhuidean—bloodying his
fingers until he realized he could use the Power—and sent them to her, half a dozen times; the
Maidens had carried the blossoms themselves, instead of sending gai’shain. She had never
acknowledged them, of course.
“Thank you,” he said finally, touching the blankets. They seemed a safe enough subject. “I
suppose you can’t have too many in the nights here.”
“Enaila asked me to bring them to you when she found out I was here to see you.” Her lips
twitched in the beginnings of an amused smile. “A number of the spear-sisters were worried that you
might not be warm enough. I am to see that you light your fire tonight; you didn’t last night.”
Rand felt his cheeks coloring. She knew. Well, she would, wouldn’t she? The bloody Maidens
may not tell her everything anymore, but they don’t bother to keep anything from her, either. “Why
did you want to see me?”
To his surprise, she folded her arms beneath her breasts and paced the short length of the room
twice before stopping to glare at him. “This was not a regard-gift,” she said accusingly, shaking the
bracelet at him. “You admitted as much.” True, though he thought she might have put a knife in his ribs
had he not conceded it. “It was simply a fool gift from a man who did not know or care what my—
what the spear-sisters might think. Well, this has no meaning either.” She pulled something from her

pouch and tossed it onto the pallet beside him. “It cancels debt between us.”
Rand picked up what she had thrown and turned it over in his hands. A belt buckle in the shape
of a dragon, ornately made in good steel and inlaid with gold. “Thank you. It’s beautiful. Aviendha,
there is no debt to cancel.”
“If you will not take it against my debt,” she said firmly, “then throw it away. I will find
something else to repay you. It is only a trinket.”
“Hardly a trinket. You must have had this made.”
“Do not think that means anything, Rand al’Thor. When I . . . gave up the spear, my spears, my
knife”—unconsciously her hand brushed her belt, where that long-bladed knife used to hang—“even
the points of my arrows were taken from me and handed to a smith to make simple things to give
away. Most I gave to friends, but the Wise Ones had me name the three men and three women I most
hate, and I was told to give each of them a gift made from my weapons, with my own hands. Bair says
it teaches humility.” Straight-backed and glaring, biting off each word, she looked and sounded
anything but humble. “So you will not think that means anything.”
“It means nothing,” he said, nodding sadly. Not that he wanted it to mean anything, really, but it
would have been pleasing to think she might be beginning to see him as a friend. It was plain foolish
to feel jealousy over her. I wonder who gave it to her? “Aviendha? Was I one of those you hate so
much?”
“Yes, Rand al’Thor.” She suddenly sounded hoarse. For a moment she turned her face away,
eyes shut and quivering. “I hate you with all of my heart. I do. And I always will.”
He did not bother to ask why. Once he had asked her why she disliked him and practically had
his nose snapped off. She had not told him, though. But this was more than a dislike she sometimes
seemed to forget. “If you really hate me,” he said reluctantly, “I will ask the Wise Ones to send
someone else to teach me.”
“No!”
“But if you—”
“No!” If anything, her denial was even more fierce this time. She planted her fists on her hips
and lectured as if she meant to drive every word home in his heart. “Even if the Wise Ones allowed
me to stop, I have toh, obligation and duty, to my near-sister Elayne, to watch you for her. You belong
to her, Rand al’Thor. To her and no other woman. Remember that.”
He felt like throwing up his hands. At least this time she was not describing to him how Elayne
looked without any clothes; some Aiel customs took even more getting used to than others. He
sometimes wondered if she and Elayne had agreed on this “watching” between them. He could not
believe it, but then again, even women who were not Aiel were odd as often as not. More than that, he
wondered who Aviendha was supposed to be protecting him from. Except for the Maidens and the
Wise Ones, Aiel women seemed to look at him half as prophecy made flesh, and thus not really flesh
at all, and half as a blood snake loose among children. The Wise Ones were nearly as bad as
Moiraine when it came to trying to make him do what they wanted, and the Maidens he did not want
to think about. The whole thing made him furious.
“Now, you listen to me. I kissed Elayne a few times, and I think she enjoyed it as much as I did,
but I am not promised to anyone. I’m not even sure she wants that much from me anymore.” In the
space of a few hours she had written him two letters; one called him the dearest light of her heart
before going on to make his ears burn, while the other named him a coldhearted wretch she never
wanted to see again and then proceeded to rip him up one side and down the other, better than
Aviendha ever had. Women were definitely odd. “I don’t have time to think about women anyway.

The only thing on my mind is uniting the Aiel, even the Shaido if I can. I—” He cut off with a groan as
the very last woman he could have hoped for swayed into the room in a clatter of jewelry, carrying a
silver tray with a blown-glass flagon of wine and two silver cups.
A diaphanous red silk scarf wrapped around Isendre’s head did nothing to hide her palely
beautiful, heart-shaped face. Her long dark hair and dark eyes never belonged to any Aiel. Her full,
pouting lips were curved enticingly—until she saw Aviendha. Then the smile faded to a sickly thing.
Aside from the scarf she had on a dozen or more necklaces of gold and ivory, some set with pearls or
polished gems. As many bracelets weighted each wrist, and even more bunched around her ankles.
That was it; she wore not another thing. He made himself keep his eyes strictly on her face, but even
so his cheeks felt hot.
Aviendha looked like a thunderhead about to spit lightning, Isendre like a woman who had just
learned she was to be boiled alive. Rand wished he were in the Pit of Doom, or anywhere but there.
Still, he got to his feet; he would have more authority looking down on them than the other way
around. “Aviendha,” he began, but she ignored him.
“Did someone send you with that?” she asked coldly.
Isendre opened her mouth, the intended lie plain on her face, then gulped and whispered, “No.”
“You have been warned about this, sorda.” A sorda was a kind of rat, especially sly according
to the Aiel, and good for absolutely nothing; its flesh was so rank that even cats seldom ate the ones
they killed. “Adelin thought the last time would have taught you.”
Isendre flinched, and swayed as if about to faint.
Rand gathered himself. “Aviendha, whether she was sent or not doesn’t matter. I am a little
thirsty, and if she was kind enough to bring me wine, she should be thanked for it.” Aviendha glanced
coolly at the two cups and raised her eyebrows. He took a deep breath. “She should not be punished
just for bringing me something to drink.” He was careful not to look at the tray himself. “Half the
Maidens under the Roof must have asked if I—”
“She was taken by the Maidens for theft from Maidens, Rand al’Thor.” Aviendha’s voice was
even colder than it had been for the other woman. “You have meddled too much already in the
business of Far Dareis Mai, more than you should have been allowed. Not even the Car’a’carn can
thwart justice; this is no concern of yours.”
He grimaced—and let it go. Whatever the Maidens did to her, Isendre certainly had coming. Just
not for this. She had entered the Waste with Hadnan Kadere, but Kadere had not cracked his teeth
when the Maidens took her for stealing the jewelry that was now all they let her wear. It had been all
Rand could do to keep her from being sent off to Shara tethered like a goat, or else dispatched naked
toward the Dragonwall with one water bag; watching her plead for mercy once she realized what the
Maidens intended, he had not been able to make himself stay out of it. Once he had killed a woman; a
woman who meant to kill him, but the memory still burned. He did not think he would ever be able to
do it again, even with his life in the balance. A foolish thing, with female Forsaken likely seeking his
blood or worse, but there it was. And if he could not kill a woman, how could he stand by and let a
woman die? Even if she deserved it?
That was the rub. In any land west of the Dragonwall, Isendre would face the gallows or the
headsman’s block for what he knew about her. About her, and Kadere, and probably most of the
merchant’s men if not all. They were Darkfriends. And he could not expose them. Not even they were
aware that he knew.
If any one of them was revealed as a Darkfriend . . . Isendre endured as best she could, because
even being a servant and kept naked was better than being tied hand and foot and left for the sun, but

none would keep silent once Moiraine had her hands on them. Aes Sedai had no more mercy for
Darkfriends than for anyone else; she would loosen their tongues in short order. And Asmodean had
come into the Waste with the merchant’s wagons, too, just another Darkfriend so far as Kadere and
the others knew, though one with authority. No doubt they thought he had taken service with the
Dragon Reborn on orders from some still higher power. To keep his teacher, to keep Moiraine from
trying to kill both of them very probably, Rand had to keep their secret.
Luckily, no one questioned why the Aiel kept such a close watch on the merchant and his men.
Moiraine thought it was the usual Aiel suspicion of outsiders in the Waste, magnified by them being in
Rhuidean; she had had to use all of her persuasion to make the Aiel let Kadere and his wagons into
the city. The suspicion was there; Rhuarc and the other chiefs likely would have set guards even if
Rand had not asked. And Kadere just seemed happy he did not have a spear through his ribs.
Rand had no idea how he was going to resolve the situation. Or if he could. It was a fine mess.
In gleemen’s stories, only villains got caught in a cleft stick like this.
Once she was sure that he was not going to try to interfere further, Aviendha turned her attention
back to the other woman. “You may leave the wine.”
Isendre half-knelt gracefully to set the tray beside his pallet, a peculiar grimace on her face. It
took Rand a moment to recognize an attempt to smile at him without letting the Aiel woman see.
“And now you will run to the first Maiden you can find,” Aviendha went on, “and tell her what
you have done. Run, sorda!” Moaning and wringing her hands, Isendre ran in a great rattle of jewelry.
As soon as she was out of the room, Aviendha rounded on him. “You belong to Elayne! You have no
right to try luring any woman, but especially not that one!”
“Her?” Rand gasped. “You think I—? Believe me, Aviendha, if she were the last woman on
earth, I’d still stay as far from her as I could run.”
“So you say.” She sniffed. “She has been switched seven times—seven!—for trying to sneak to
your bed. She would not persist like that without some encouragement. She faces Far Dareis Mai
justice, and she is no concern of even the Car’a’carn. Take that as your lesson for today on our
customs. And remember that you belong to my near-sister!” Without letting him get a word in, she
stalked out wearing such a look that he thought Isendre might not survive if Aviendha caught up to her.
Letting out a long breath, he got up long enough to put the tray and its wine in a corner of the
room. He was not about to drink anything Isendre brought him.
Seven times she’s tried to reach me? She must have learned that he interceded for her; no doubt
to her way of thinking, if he was willing to do that for a smoky look and a smile, what might he do for
more? He shivered at the thought as much as the increasing cold. He would rather have a scorpion in
his bed. If the Maidens failed to convince her, he might tell her what he knew about her; that should
put an end to any schemes.
Snuffing the lamps, he crawled onto his pallet in the dark, still booted and fully dressed, and
fumbled around until he had pulled all of the blankets over him. Without the fire, he suspected he
really would be grateful to Aviendha before morning. Setting the wards of Spirit that shielded his
dreams from intrusion was almost automatic to him now, but even as he did it, he chuckled to himself.
He could have gotten into bed and then put out the lamps, with the Power. It was the simple things
that he never thought of doing with the Power.
For a time he lay waiting for his body’s heat to warm the inside of the blankets. How the same
place could be so hot by day and so cold by night was beyond him. Sticking one hand under his coat,
he fingered the half-healed scar on his side. That wound, the one that Moiraine could never
completely Heal, was what would kill him, eventually. He was sure of it. His blood on the rocks of

Shayol Ghul. That was what the Prophecies said.
Not tonight. I won’t think of that tonight. I have a little time yet. But if the seals can be
shaved with a knife, now, do they still hold as strongly . . . ? No. Not tonight.
The inside of the blankets was becoming a little warmer, and he shifted around, trying and
failing to find a comfortable way to lie. I should have washed, he thought drowsily. Egwene was
probably in a warm sweat tent right that minute. Half the time he used one, a fistful of Maidens tried
to come in with him—and nearly rolled on the ground laughing when he insisted on them staying
outside. It was bad enough having to undress and dress in the steam.
Sleep finally came, and with it, safely protected dreams, safe from the Wise Ones or anyone
else. Not protected from his own thoughts, though. Three women invaded them continually. Not
Isendre, except in a brief nightmare that nearly woke him. By turns he dreamed of Elayne, and Min,
and Aviendha, by turns and together. Only Elayne had ever looked at him as a man, but all three saw
him as who he was, not what he was. Aside from the nightmare, they were all pleasant dreams.

CHAPTER
5

Among the Wise Ones

Standing as close as she could to the small fire in the middle of the tent, Egwene still shivered
as she poured water from the generous teakettle into a wide, blue-striped bowl. She had lowered the
sides of the tent, but cold seeped through the colorful layered rugs covering the ground, and all the
fire’s heat seemed to rush up and out of the smoke hole in the middle of the tent roof, leaving only the
smell of the burning cow dung. Her teeth wanted to chatter.
Already the steam from the water was beginning to fade; she embraced saidar for a moment and
channeled Fire to heat it more. Amys or Bair would probably have washed in it cold, though in fact
they always took sweat baths. So I’m not as tough as they are. I did not grow up in the Waste. I
don’t have to freeze to death and wash in cold water if I don’t want to. She still felt guilty as she
lathered a cloth with a piece of lavender-scented soap bought from Hadnan Kadere. The Wise Ones
had never asked her to do differently, but it still felt like cheating.
Letting go of the True Source made her sigh with remorse. Even trembling with cold, she
laughed softly at her own foolishness. The wonder of being filled with the Power, the wondrous rush
of life and awareness, was its own danger. The more you drew on saidar, the more you wanted to
draw, and without self-discipline you eventually drew more than you could handle and either died or
stilled yourself. And that was nothing to laugh at.
That’s one of your biggest faults, she lectured herself firmly. You always want to do more than
you’re supposed to. You ought to wash in cold water; that would teach you self-discipline. Only
there was so much to learn, and it sometimes seemed a lifetime would be too short to learn it. Her
teachers were always so cautious, whether Wise Ones or Aes Sedai in the Tower; it was hard to hold
back when she knew that in so many ways she already outstripped them. I can do more than they
realize.
A blast of freezing air hit her, swirling smoke from the fire about the tent, and a woman’s voice
said, “If it pleases you—”
Egwene jumped, yelping shrilly before managing to get out, “Shut that!” She hugged herself to
stop from capering. “Get in or get out, but shut it!” All that effort to be warm, and now she was icy
goose bumps from head to toe!
The white-robed woman shuffled into the tent on her knees and let the tent flap drop. She kept
her eyes downcast, her hands folded meekly; she would have done the same if Egwene had hit her
instead of just shouting. “If it pleases you,” she said softly, “the Wise One Amys sent me to bring you
to the sweat tent.”
Wishing she could stand on top of the fire, Egwene groaned. The Light burn Bair and her
stubbornness! If not for the white-haired old Wise One, they could be in rooms in the city instead of

tents on the edge of it. I could have a room with a proper fireplace. And a door. She was willing to
bet that Rand did not have to put up with people wandering in on him whenever they wanted. Rand
bloody Dragon al’Thor snaps his fingers, and the Maidens jump like serving girls. I’ll wager
they’ve found him a real bed, instead of a pallet on the ground. She was sure that he got a hot bath
every night. The Maidens probably haul buckets of hot water up to his rooms. I’ll bet they even
found him a proper copper bathtub.
Amys, and even Melaine, had been amenable to Egwene’s suggestion, but Bair had put her foot
down, and they acquiesced like gai’shain. Egwene supposed that with Rand bringing so much change,
Bair wanted to hold on to as much of the old ways as she could, but she wished the woman could
have chosen something else to be intractable over.
There was no thought of refusing. She had promised the Wise Ones to forget that she was Aes
Sedai—the easy part, since she was not—and do exactly as she was told. That was the hard part; she
had been away from the Tower long enough to become her own mistress again. But Amys had told her
flatly that dreamwalking was dangerous even after you knew what you were about and far more so
until then. If she would not obey in the waking world, they could not trust her to obey in the dream,
and they would not take the responsibility. So she did chores right along with Aviendha, accepted
chastisement with as good a grace as she could muster, and hopped whenever Amys or Melaine or
Bair said frog. In a manner of speaking. None of them had ever seen a frog. Not that they’ll want
anything but for me to hand them their tea. No, it would be Aviendha’s turn to do that tonight.
For a moment she considered donning stockings, but finally just bent to slip on her shoes. Sturdy
shoes, suitable for the Waste; she rather regretted the silk slippers she had worn in Tear. “What is
your name?” she asked, trying to be companionable.
“Cowinde” was the docile reply.
Egwene sighed. She kept trying to be friends with the gai’shain, but they never responded.
Servants were one thing she had not had a chance to get used to, though of course gai’shain were not
precisely servants. “You were a Maiden?”
A quick, fierce flash of deep blue eyes told her that her guess was correct, but just as quickly
they lowered again. “I am gai’shain. Before and after are not now, and only now exists.”
“What is your sept and clan?” Usually there was no need to ask, not even with gai’shain.
“I serve the Wise One Melaine of the Jhirad sept, of the Goshien Aiel.”
Trying to choose between two cloaks, a stout brown woolen and a blue quilted silk she had
purchased from Kadere—the merchant had sold everything in his wagons to make room for
Moiraine’s freight, and at very good prices—Egwene paused to frown at the woman. That was no
proper response. She had heard that a form of the bleakness had taken some gai’shain; when their
year and a day was done, they simply refused to put off the robe. “When is your time up?” she asked.
Cowinde crouched lower, almost huddling over her knees. “I am gai’shain.”
“But when will you be able to return to your sept, to your own hold?”
“I am gai’shain,” the woman hoarsely told the rugs in front of her face. “If the answer
displeases, punish me, but I can give no other.”
“Don’t be silly,” Egwene said sharply. “And straighten up. You aren’t a toad.”
The white-robed woman obeyed immediately and sat there on her heels, submissively awaiting
another command. That brief flare of spirit might as well never have been.
Egwene took a deep breath. The woman had made her own accommodation with the bleakness.
A foolish one, but nothing she could say would change it. Anyway, she was supposed to be on her
way to the sweat tent, not talking with Cowinde.

Remembering that cold draft, she hesitated. The icy gust had made two large white blossoms,
resting in a shallow bowl, curl partway closed. They came from a plant called a segade, a fat,
leafless, leathery thing that bristled with spines. She had come on Aviendha looking at them in her
hands that morning; the Aiel woman had given a start when she saw her, then pushed them into
Egwene’s hands, saying she had picked them for her. She supposed there was enough of the Maiden
left in Aviendha that she did not want to admit liking flowers. Though come to think of it, she had seen
the occasional Maiden wearing a blossom in her hair or on her coat.
You are just trying to put it off, Egwene al’Vere. Now stop being a silly woolhead! You are
being as foolish as Cowinde. “Lead the way,” she said, and just had time to swing the woolen cloak
around her nakedness before the woman swept open the tent flap for her, and for the bone-chilling
night.
Overhead, the stars were crisp points in the darkness, and the three-quarter moon was bright.
The Wise Ones’ camp was a cluster of two dozen low mounds, not a hundred paces from where one
of Rhuidean’s paved streets ended in hard, cracked clay and stones. Moonshadows turned the city
into strange cliffs and crags. Every tent had its flaps down, and the smells of fires and cooking
blended to fill the air.
The other Wise Ones came here for almost daily gatherings, but they spent nights with their own
septs. Several even slept in Rhuidean now. But not Bair. This was as close to the city as Bair had
been willing to come; if Rand had not been there, doubtless she would have insisted on making camp
in the mountains.
Egwene held the cloak tight with both hands and walked as fast as she could. Icy tendrils curled
under the cloak’s bottom, swept in every time her bare legs kicked a gap open. Cowinde had to pull
her white robes to her knees in order to keep ahead. Egwene did not need the gai’shain’s guidance,
but since the woman had been sent to bring her, she would be shamed and maybe offended if not
allowed to. Clenching her teeth to keep them from chattering, Egwene wished the woman would run.
The sweat tent looked like any other, low and wide, with the flaps lowered all around, except
that the smoke hole had been covered. Nearby a fire had burned down to glowing embers scattered
over a few rocks the size of a man’s head. There was not enough light to define the much smaller
shadowed mound beside the tent entrance, but she knew it was neatly folded women’s clothes.
Taking one deep, chilling breath, she hurriedly scuffed off her shoes, let her cloak drop, and all
but dove into the tent. An instant of shuddering cold before the flap fell shut behind her, then steamy
heat clamped down, squeezing out sweat that covered her in an instant sheen while she was still
gasping and shaking.
The three Wise Ones who were teaching her about dreamwalking sat sweating unconcernedly,
their waist-length hair hanging damply. Bair was talking to Melaine, whose green-eyed beauty and
red-gold hair made a sharp contrast to the older woman’s leathery face and long white tresses. Amys
was white-haired, too—or perhaps it was just so pale a yellow that it seemed white—but she did not
look old. She and Melaine could both channel—not many Wise Ones could—and she had something
of the Aes Sedai look of agelessness about her. Moiraine, seeming slight and small beside the others,
also looked unruffled, although sweat rolled down her pale nudity and slicked her dark hair to her
scalp, with a regal refusal to acknowledge that she had no clothes on. The Wise Ones were using
slim, curved pieces of bronze, called staera, to scrape off sweat and the day’s dirt.
Aviendha was squatting sweatily beside the big black kettle of hot, sooty rocks in the middle of
the tent, carefully using a pair of tongs to move a last stone from a smaller kettle to the larger. That
done, she sprinkled water onto the rocks from a gourd, adding to the steam. If she let the steam fall too

far, she would be spoken to sharply at the very least. The next time the Wise Ones met in the sweat
tent, it would be Egwene’s turn to tend the rocks.
Egwene cautiously sat down cross-legged next to Bair—instead of layered rugs, there was only
rocky ground, unpleasantly hot, lumpy and damp—and realized with a shock that Aviendha had been
switched, and recently. When the Aiel woman gingerly took her own place, beside Egwene, she did
so with a face as stony as the ground, but a face that could not hide her flinch.
This was something Egwene did not expect. The Wise Ones exacted a hard discipline—harder
even than the Tower, which took some doing—but Aviendha worked at learning to channel with a
grim determination. She could not dreamwalk, but she surely put as much effort into absorbing every
art of a Wise One as she could ever have put into learning her weapons as a Maiden. Of course, after
she confessed to letting Rand know about the Wise Ones watching his dreams, they had made her
spend three days digging shoulder-deep holes and filling them in again, but that was one of the few
times Aviendha had ever seemed to put a foot wrong. Amys and the other two had held her up to
Egwene so often as a model of meek obedience and proper fortitude that sometimes Egwene wanted
to shriek, even if Aviendha was a friend.
“You took long enough in coming,” Bair said grumpily, while Egwene was still gingerly
searching for a comfortable seat. Her voice was thin and reedy, but a reed of iron. She continued to
scrape her arms with a staera.
“I am sorry,” Egwene said. There; that should be meek enough.
Bair sniffed. “You are Aes Sedai beyond the Dragonwall, but here you are yet a pupil, and a
pupil does not dally. When I send for Aviendha, or send her for something, she runs, even if all I want
is a pin. You could do much worse than to pattern yourself after her.”
Flushing, Egwene tried to make her voice humble. “I will try, Bair.” This was the first time a
Wise One had made the comparison in front of others. She sneaked a glance at Aviendha and was
surprised to find her looking thoughtful. Sometimes she wished her “near-sister” were not always
such a good example.
“The girl will learn, Bair, or she will not,” Melaine said irritably. “Instruct her in promptness
later, if she still needs it.” No more than ten or twelve years older than Aviendha, she usually
sounded as if she had a burr under her skirts. Maybe she was sitting on a sharp rock. She would not
move if she was; she would expect the rock to move. “I tell you again, Moiraine Sedai, the Aiel
follow He Who Comes With the Dawn, not the White Tower.”
Obviously, Egwene was meant to pick up what they were talking about as they went on.
“It may be,” Amys said in a level voice, “that the Aiel will serve the Aes Sedai again, but that
time has not come yet, Moiraine Sedai.” Her scraping barely paused as she eyed the Aes Sedai
calmly.
It would come, Egwene knew, now that Moiraine was aware that some of the Wise Ones could
channel. Aes Sedai would be journeying into the Waste to find girls who could be taught, and would
almost certainly be trying to take any Wise One with the ability back to the Tower, too. Once she had
worried about the Wise Ones being browbeaten and dominated, hauled away whenever they wanted;
Aes Sedai never let any woman who could channel run free of the Tower for long. She did not worry
anymore, though the Wise Ones themselves seemed to. Amys and Melaine could match any Aes Sedai
will for will, as they showed every day with Moiraine. Bair could very likely make even Siuan
Sanche jump through hoops, and Bair could not even channel.
For that matter, Bair was not the strongest-willed Wise One. That honor went to an even older
woman, Sorilea, of the Jarra sept of the Chareen Aiel. The Wise One of Shende Hold could channel

less than most novices, but she was as likely to send another Wise One on an errand as a gai’shain.
And they went. No, there was no reason to distress herself over Wise Ones being bullied.
“It is understandable that you wish to spare your lands,” Bair put in, “but Rand al’Thor
obviously does not mean to lead us to punish. No one who submits to He Who Comes With the Dawn,
and the Aiel, will be harmed.” So that was it. Of course.
“It is not only sparing lives or lands that concerns me.” Moiraine made wiping sweat from her
brow with one finger into a queenly gesture, but her voice sounded nearly as tight as Melaine’s. “If
you allow this, it will be disastrous. Years of planning are coming to fruition, and he means to ruin it
all.”
“Plans of the White Tower,” Amys said, so smoothly she might have been agreeing. “Those
plans have nothing to do with us. We, and the other Wise Ones, must consider what is right for the
Aiel. We will see that the Aiel do what is best for the Aiel.”
Egwene wondered what the clan chiefs would say about that. Of course, they frequently
complained that the Wise Ones meddled in matters that were not theirs, so perhaps it would not come
as a surprise. The chiefs all seemed to be hard-willed, intelligent men, but she believed they had as
much chance against the combined Wise Ones as the Village Council back home did against the
Women’s Circle.
This time, though, Moiraine was right.
“If Rand—” she began, but Bair stepped on her firmly.
“We will hear what you have to say later, girl. Your knowledge of Rand al’Thor is valuable, but
you will hold your peace and listen until you are bidden to speak. And stop looking sullen, or I will
dose you with bluespine tea.”
Egwene grimaced. Respect for the Aes Sedai, though a respect between equals, included but
little for the pupil, even one they believed was Aes Sedai. She kept her tongue still, in any case. Bair
was capable of sending her to fetch her herb pouches and telling her to brew the incredibly bitter tea
herself; it had no purpose at all except to cure sullenness or sulkiness or whatever else a Wise One
might find disfavor with, which it did by taste alone. Aviendha gave her a comforting pat on the arm.
“You believe it will not be a catastrophe for the Aiel as well?” It must have been difficult to
sound as cool as a winter stream when you glistened from head to foot with condensed steam and
your own sweat, but Moiraine apparently had no difficulty. “It will be the Aiel War all over again.
You will kill and burn and loot towns as you did then, until you have turned every man and woman
against you.”
“The fifth is our due, Aes Sedai,” Melaine said, throwing her long hair back over her shoulder
so she could work a staera across a smooth shoulder. Even heavy and damp with the steam, her hair
glistened like silk. “We took no more even from the treekillers.” Her glance at Moiraine was too
bland not to be significant; they knew she was Cairhienin. “Your kings and queens take as much in
their taxes.”
“And when the nations turn against you?” Moiraine persisted. “In the Aiel War, the nations
united turned you back. That can and will happen again, with great loss of life on both sides.”
“None of us fears death, Aes Sedai,” Amys told her, smiling gently as if explaining something to
a child. “Life is a dream from which we all must wake before we can dream again. Besides, only four
clans crossed the Dragonwall under Janduin. Six are here already, and you say Rand al’Thor means
to take all of the clans.”
“The Prophecy of Rhuidean says he will break us.” The spark in Melaine’s green eyes could
have been for Moiraine or because she was not as resigned as she sounded. “What does it matter

whether it is here or beyond the Dragonwall?”
“You will lose him the support of every nation west of the Dragonwall,” Moiraine said. She
looked as calm as ever, but an edge in her voice said she was ready to chew rocks. “He must have
their support!”
“He has the support of the Aiel nation,” Bair told her in that fragile, unyielding voice. She
emphasized her words by gesturing with the slim metal blade. “The clans have never been a nation,
but now he makes us one.”
“We will not help you turn him in this, Moiraine Sedai,” Amys added just as firmly.
“You may leave us now, Aes Sedai, if it pleases you,” Bair said. “We have discussed what you
wished to discuss as much as we will tonight.” It was politely said, but a dismissal all the same.
“I will leave you,” Moiraine replied, once again all serenity. She sounded as though it were her
suggestion, her decision. By this time she was used to the Wise Ones making it clear they were not
under the Tower’s authority. “I have other matters to see to.”
That much had to be the truth, of course. Very likely something concerning Rand. Egwene knew
better than to ask; if Moiraine wanted her to know, she would tell her, and if not . . . If not, she would
be handed some slippery bit of Aes Sedai avoidance of a lie, or else be told bluntly that it was none
of her business. Moiraine knew that “Egwene Sedai of the Green Ajah” was a fraud. She tolerated the
lie in public, but otherwise she let Egwene know her proper place whenever it suited her.
As soon as Moiraine had gone, in a burst of cold air, Amys said, “Aviendha, pour the tea.”
The young Aiel woman gave a startled jerk, and her mouth opened twice before she said faintly,
“I must brew it yet.” With that she scurried out of the tent on all fours. The second blast from outside
dimmed the steam.
The Wise Ones exchanged looks that were almost as surprised as Aviendha’s. And Egwene’s;
Aviendha always did even the most onerous chores efficiently, if not always with a good grace.
Something must be troubling her greatly, to make her forget a thing like making tea. The Wise Ones
always wanted tea.
“More steam, girl,” Melaine said.
That was her, Egwene realized, with Aviendha gone. Hurriedly splashing more water on the
rocks, she channeled to heat the stones further, and the kettle, until she heard stones cracking and the
kettle itself radiated heat like a furnace. The Aiel might be used to leaping from roasting in their own
juices to freezing, but she was not. Hot, thick clouds rolled up to fill the tent. Amys nodded
approvingly; she and Melaine could see the glow of saidar surrounding her, of course, though she
herself could not. Melaine merely went on scraping with her staera.
Letting go of the True Source, she sat back and leaned close to Bair to whisper, “Has Aviendha
done something very wrong?” She did not know how Aviendha would feel about it, but she saw no
reason to embarrass her, even behind her back.
Bair had no such compunctions. “You mean her stripes?” she said in a normal voice. “She came
to me and said she had lied twice today, though she would not say to whom or about what. It was her
own affair, of course, so long as she did not lie to a Wise One, but she claimed her honor required
that a toh must be met.”
“She asked you to . . .” Egwene gasped, but could not finish.
Bair nodded as if it were not very much out of the ordinary at all. “I gave her a few extra for
troubling me with it. If ji was involved, her obligation is not to me. Very likely her so-called lies
were nothing anyone but a Far Dareis Mai would worry about. Maidens, even former Maidens, are
sometimes as fussy as men.” Amys gave her a flat look that was plain even in the thick steam. Like

Aviendha, Amys had been Far Dareis Mai before becoming a Wise One.
Egwene had never met an Aiel who was not fussy about ji’e’toh, the way she saw it. But this!
Aiel were all mad as loons.
Apparently, Bair had already put the matter out of her mind. “There are more Lost Ones in the
Three-fold Land than I can ever remember before,” she said to the tent at large. That was what the
Aiel had always called the Tinkers, the Tuatha’an.
“They flee the troubles beyond the Dragonwall.” The sneer in Melaine’s voice was clear.
“I have heard,” Amys said slowly, “that some of those who run after the bleakness have gone to
the Lost Ones and asked to be taken in.” A long silence followed. They knew now that the Tuatha’an
had the same descent as themselves, that they had broken away before the Aiel crossed the Spine of
the World into the Waste, but if anything the knowledge had only deepened their aversion.
“He brings change,” Melaine whispered harshly into the steam.
“I thought you were reconciled to the changes he brings,” Egwene said, sympathy welling up in
her voice. It must be very hard to have your whole life stood on end. She half-expected to be told to
hold her tongue again, but no one did.
“Reconciled,” Bair said, as though tasting the word. “Better to say we endure them, as best we
can.”
“He transforms everything.” Amys sounded troubled. “Rhuidean. The Lost Ones. The bleakness,
and telling what should not have been told.” The Wise Ones—all the Aiel, for that matter—still had
difficulty speaking of that.
“The Maidens cluster about him as though they owe more to him than to their own clans,” Bair
added. “For the first time ever, they have allowed a man beneath a Roof of the Maidens.” For a
moment Amys looked about to say something, but whatever she knew about the inner workings of Far
Dareis Mai she shared with no one but those who were or had been Maidens of the Spear.
“The chiefs no longer listen to us as they did,” Melaine muttered. “Oh, they ask our advice as
always—they have not become complete fools—but Bael will no longer tell me what he has said to
Rand al’Thor, or Rand al’Thor to him. He says I must ask Rand al’Thor, who tells me to ask Bael.
The Car’a’carn, I can do nothing about, but Bael . . . He has always been a stubborn, infuriating man,
yet now he is beyond all bounds. Sometimes I want to thump his head with a stick.” Amys and Bair
chuckled as if that were a fine joke. Or perhaps they just wanted to laugh to forget the changes for a
time.
“There are only three things you can do with a man like that,” Bair chortled. “Stay away from
him, kill him, or marry him.”
Melaine stiffened, her sun-dark face going red. For a moment Egwene thought the golden-haired
Wise One was about to let fly words hotter than her face. Then a biting gust announced Aviendha’s
return carrying a worked silver tray holding a yellow-glazed teapot, delicate cups of golden Sea Folk
porcelain, and a stone jar of honey.
She shivered as she poured—no doubt she had not bothered to wrap anything around herself out
there—and hurriedly passed around the cups and the honey. She did not fill cups for herself and
Egwene until Amys told her she could, of course.
“More steam,” Melaine said; the chill air seemed to have cooled her temper. Aviendha set down
her cup untouched and scrambled for the gourd, plainly trying to make up for her lapse with the tea.
“Egwene,” Amys said, sipping her tea, “how would Rand al’Thor take it if Aviendha asked to
sleep in his sleeping chamber?” Aviendha froze with the gourd in her hands.
“In his—?” Egwene gasped. “You cannot ask her to do such a thing! You cannot!”

“Fool girl,” Bair muttered. “We do not ask her to share his blankets. But will he think that is
what she asks? Will he even allow it? Men are strange creatures at the best, and he was not raised
among us, so he is stranger still.”
“He certainly would not think any such thing,” Egwene spluttered, then more slowly, “I don’t
think he would. But it isn’t proper. It just isn’t!”
“I ask that you not require this of me,” Aviendha said, sounding more humble than Egwene
would have believed she could. She was sprinkling water in jerky motions, sending up increasing
clouds of steam. “I have been learning a great deal the past days, not having to spend time with him.
Since you have allowed Egwene and Moiraine Sedai to help me with channeling, I learn even faster.
Not that they teach any better than you, of course,” she added hastily, “but I want very much to learn.”
“You will still learn,” Melaine told her. “You will not have to stay every hour with him. As long
as you apply yourself, your lessons will not be much slowed. You do not study while you sleep.”
“I cannot,” Aviendha mumbled, head down over the water gourd. More loudly, and more firmly,
she added, “I will not.” Her head came up, and her eyes were blue-green fire. “I will not be there
when he summons that flip-skirt Isendre to his blankets again!”
Egwene gaped at her. “Isendre!” She had seen—and heartily disapproved of—the scandalous
way the Maidens kept the woman naked, but this! “You can’t really mean he—”
“Be silent!” Bair snapped like a whip. Her blue-eyed stare could have chipped stone. “Both of
you! You are both young, but even the Maidens should know men can be fools, especially when they
are not attached to a woman who can guide them.”
“I am glad,” Amys said dryly, “to see you no longer hold your emotions so tightly, Aviendha.
Maidens are as foolish as men when it comes to that; I remember it well, and it embarrasses me still.
Letting emotions go clouds judgment for a moment, but holding them in clouds it always. Just be sure
you do not release them too often, or when it is best to keep control of them.”
Melaine leaned forward on her hands, until it seemed the sweat dripping from her face must fall
on the hot kettle. “You know your fate, Aviendha. You will be a Wise One of great strength and great
authority, and more besides. You already have a strength in you. It saw you through your first test, and
it will see you through this.”
“My honor,” Aviendha said hoarsely, then swallowed, unable to go on. She crouched there,
huddling around the gourd as if it contained the honor she wanted to protect.
“The Pattern does not see ji’e’toh,” Bair told her, with only a hint of sympathy, if that. “Only
what must and will be. Men and Maidens struggle against fate even when it is clear the Pattern
weaves on despite their struggles, but you are no longer Far Dareis Mai. You must learn to ride fate.
Only by surrendering to the Pattern can you begin to have some control over the course of your own
life. If you fight, the Pattern will still force you, and you will find only misery where you might have
found contentment instead.”
To Egwene, that sounded very much like what she had been taught concerning the One Power.
To control saidar, you first had to surrender to it. Fight, and it would come wildly, or overwhelm
you; surrender and guide it gently, and it did as you wished. But that did not explain why they wanted
Aviendha to do this thing. She asked as much, adding again, “It is not proper.”
Instead of answering, Amys said, “Will Rand al’Thor refuse to allow her? We cannot force
him.” Bair and Melaine were looking at Egwene as intently as Amys.
They were not going to tell her why. It was easier to make a stone talk than to get something out
of a Wise One against her will. Aviendha was studying her toes in sulky resignation; she knew the
Wise Ones would get what they wanted, one way or another.

“I don’t know,” Egwene said slowly. “I do not know him as well as I used to.” She regretted
that, but so much had happened, quite aside from her realizing that she did not love him as more than a
brother. Her training, in the Tower as well as here, had changed things just as much as him being who
he had become. “If you give him a good reason, perhaps. I think he likes Aviendha.” The young Aiel
woman heaved a heavy sigh without looking up.
“A good reason,” Bair snorted. “When I was a girl, any man would have been overjoyed to have
a young woman show that much interest in him. He would have gone to pick the flowers for her bridal
wreath himself.” Aviendha started, and glared at the Wise Ones with some of her old spirit. “Well,
we will find a reason even someone raised in the wetlands can accept.”
“It is several nights before your agreed meeting in Tel’aran’rhiod,” Amys said. “With Nynaeve,
this time.”
“That one could learn much,” Bair put in, “if she were not so stubborn.”
“Your nights are free until then,” Melaine said. “That is, unless you have been entering
Tel’aran’rhiod without us.”
Egwene suspected what was coming. “Of course not,” she told them. It had only been a little.
Any more than a little, and they would find out for sure.
“Have you succeeded in finding either Nynaeve’s or Elayne’s dreams?” Amys asked. Casually,
as if it were nothing.
“No, Amys.”
Finding someone else’s dreams was a lot harder than stepping into Tel’aran’rhiod, the World of
Dreams, especially if they were any distance away. It was easier both the closer they were and the
better you knew them. The Wise Ones still demanded that she not enter Tel’aran’rhiod without at
least one of them along, but someone else’s dream was maybe just as dangerous in its own way. In
Tel’aran’rhiod she was in control of herself and of things around her to a large degree, unless one of
the Wise Ones decided to take over; her command of Tel’aran’rhiod was increasing, but she still
could not match any of them, with their long experience. In another’s dream, though, you were a part
of that dream; it took all you could muster not to behave as the dreamer wanted, be as their dream
took you, and still sometimes it did not work. The Wise Ones had been very careful when watching
Rand’s dreams never to enter fully. Even so they insisted she learn. If they were to teach
dreamwalking, they meant to teach all that they knew of it.
She was not reluctant, exactly, but the few times they had let her practice, with themselves and
once with Rhuarc, had been chastening experiences. The Wise Ones had some considerable mastery
over their own dreams, so what had happened there—to show her the dangers, they said—had all
been their doing, but it had been a shock to learn that Rhuarc saw her as a little more than a child, like
his youngest daughters. And her own control had wavered for one fatal moment. After that she had
been little more than a child; she still could not look at the man without remembering being given a
doll for studying hard. And being as pleased with the gift as with his approval. Amys had had to come
and take her away from happy play with it. Amys knowing was bad enough, but she suspected that
Rhuarc remembered some of it, too.
“You must keep trying,” Amys said. “You have the strength to reach them, even as far as they
are. And it will do you no harm to learn how they see you.”
She was not so sure of that herself. Elayne was a friend, but Nynaeve had been Wisdom of
Emond’s Field for most of her growing up. She suspected Nynaeve’s dreams would be worse than
Rhuarc’s.
“Tonight I will sleep away from the tents,” Amys went on. “Not far. You should be able to find

me easily, if you try. If I do not dream of you, we will speak of it in the morning.”
Egwene suppressed a groan. Amys had guided her to Rhuarc’s dreams—she herself had
remained only an instant, barely long enough to reveal that Rhuarc still saw her, unchanged, as the
young woman he had married—and the Wise Ones had always been in the same tent before when she
tried.
“Well,” Bair said, rubbing her hands, “we have heard what needed to be heard. The rest of you
can remain if you wish, but I feel clean enough to go to my blankets. I am not so young as the rest of
you.” Young or not, she could probably run any of them into the ground, then carry them the rest of the
way.
As Bair was getting to her feet, Melaine spoke, and strangely for her, she was hesitant. “I need
. . . I must ask your help, Bair. And you, Amys.” The older woman settled back, and both she and
Amys looked at Melaine expectantly. “I . . . would ask you to approach Dorindha for me.” The last
words came out in a rush. Amys smiled widely, and Bair cackled aloud. Aviendha seemed to
understand, too, and be startled, but Egwene was lost.
Then Bair laughed. “You always said you did not need a husband and did not want one. I have
buried three, and would not mind another. They are very useful when the night is cold.”
“A woman can change her mind.” Melaine’s voice was firm enough, but belied by the deep flush
in her cheeks. “I cannot stay away from Bael, and I cannot kill him. If Dorindha will accept me as her
sister-wife, I will make my bridal wreath to lay at Bael’s feet.”
“What if he steps on it instead of picking it up?” Bair wanted to know. Amys fell back, laughing
and slapping her thighs.
Egwene did not think there was much danger of that, not the way Aiel customs ran. If Dorindha
decided she wanted Melaine for sister-wife, Bael would not have much say in the matter. It no longer
shocked her, precisely, that a man could have two wives. Not exactly. Different lands mean different
customs, she reminded herself firmly. She had never been able to bring herself to ask, but for all she
knew, there might be Aiel women with two husbands. They were very strange people.
“I ask you to act as my first-sisters in this. I think that Dorindha likes me well enough.”
As soon as Melaine spoke those words, the other women’s hilarity changed to something else.
They still laughed, but they hugged her and told her how happy they were for her, and how well she
would do with Bael. Amys and Bair, at least, took Dorindha’s acceptance for granted. The three of
them departed all but arm-in-arm, still laughing and giggling like girls. Not before telling Egwene and
Aviendha to straighten the tent, though.
“Egwene, could a woman of your land accept a sister-wife?” Aviendha asked, using a stick to
push the cover off the smoke hole.
Egwene wished she had left that duty till last; the heat began to dissipate immediately. “I don’t
know,” she said, quickly gathering the cups and the honey jar. The siaera went onto the tray, too. “I
don’t think so. Maybe if it was a close friend,” she added hurriedly; there was no point in seeming to
denigrate Aiel ways.
Aviendha only grunted and began pushing up the side flaps.
Teeth chattering as loudly as the rattle of teacups and bronze blades on the tray, Egwene scurried
outside. The Wise Ones were dressing unhurriedly, as though this were a balmy night and they in
sleeping chambers in some hold. A white-robed figure, pale in the moonlight, took the tray from her,
and she quickly began searching for her cloak and shoes. They were nowhere among the remaining
garments on the ground.
“I had your things taken to your tent,” Bair said, tying the laces of her blouse. “You will not need

them yet.”
Egwene’s stomach sank into her feet. Hopping in place, she flapped her arms in a futile effort for
warmth; at least they did not tell her to stop. Abruptly she realized the snowy-robed figure bearing the
tray away was too tall for even an Aiel woman. Gritting her teeth, she glared at the Wise Ones, who
seemed not to care if she froze to death jumping up and down. To the Aielwomen it might not matter
that a man had seen them with no clothes on, at least if he was gai’shain, but it did to her!
In a moment, Aviendha joined them and, seeing her leaping about, merely stood there without
any effort to find her own garments. She showed no more effect of the cold than the Wise Ones.
“Now,” Bair said, settling her shawl on her shoulders. “You, Aviendha, are not only stubborn as
a man, you cannot remember a simple task you have done many times. You, Egwene, are just as
stubborn, and you still think you can linger in your tent when you are summoned. Let us hope running
fifty times around the camp will temper your stubbornness, clear your minds, and remind you of how
to answer a summons or do a chore. Off with you.”
Without a word, Aviendha immediately began loping toward the edge of the camp, easily
dodging dark-shrouded tent ropes. Egwene hesitated only a moment before following. The Aiel
woman kept her pace down so she could catch up. The night air froze her, and the cracked stony clay
underfoot was just as cold, and tried to catch her toes besides. Aviendha ran with effortless ease.
As they reached the last tent and turned southward, Aviendha said, “Do you know why I study so
hard?” Neither the cold nor running had made an impression on her voice.
Egwene was shivering so hard she could barely speak. “No. Why?”
“Because Bair and the others always point to you, and tell me how easily you learn, how you
never have to have something explained twice. They say I ought to be more like you.” She gave
Egwene a sidelong glance, and Egwene found herself sharing a giggle as they ran. “That is part of the
reason. The things I am learning to do . . .” Aviendha shook her head, wonderment plain even by
moonlight. “And the Power itself. I have never felt like that. So alive. I can smell the faintest scent,
feel the slightest stir in the air.”
“It is dangerous to hold on too long or too much,” Egwene said. Running did seem to warm her a
little, though now and again a shudder ran through her. “I’ve told you that, and I know the Wise Ones
have, too.”
Aviendha merely sniffed. “Do you think I would stab my own foot with a spear?”
For a time they ran in silence.
“Did Rand really . . . ?” Egwene said finally. The cold had nothing to do with her difficulty
getting the words out; in fact, she was beginning to sweat again. “I mean . . . Isendre?” She could not
make herself say it clearer than that.
At last Aviendha said slowly, “I do not think that he did.” She sounded angry. “But why would
she ignore switchings if he has shown no interest in her? She is a milk-hearted wetlander who waits
for men to come to her. I saw how he looked at her, though he tried to hide it. He enjoyed looking at
her.”
Egwene wondered if her friend ever thought of her as a milk-hearted wetlander. Probably not, or
they would not be friends. But Aviendha had never learned to worry if what she said might hurt
someone; she would probably be surprised to learn that Egwene could even think of being hurt.
“The way the Maidens make her dress,” Egwene admitted reluctantly, “any man would look.”
Reminded that she herself was in the open without any clothes, she stumbled and almost fell as she
looked around anxiously. The night was empty as far as she could make out. Even the Wise Ones
were already back in their tents. Warm in their blankets. She was sweating, but the beads seemed to

want to freeze as soon as they appeared.
“He belongs to Elayne,” Aviendha said fiercely.
“I admit I don’t know your customs fully, but ours are not the same as yours. He is not betrothed
to Elayne.” Why am I defending him? He’s the one who ought to be switched! But honesty made her
go on. “Even your Aielmen have the right to say no, if they’re asked.”
“You and she are near-sisters, as you and I are,” Aviendha protested, slowing a step before
picking it up again. “Did you not ask me to look after him for her? Do you not want her to have him?”
“Of course I do. If he wants her.” That was not exactly true. She wanted Elayne to have what
happiness she could, in love with the Dragon Reborn as she was, and she would do everything short
of tying Rand hand and foot to see that Elayne got what she wanted. Maybe not far short, at that, if
need be. Admitting it was another thing. Aielwomen were far more forward than she could ever make
herself be. “It would not be right, otherwise.”
“He belongs to her,” Aviendha said determinedly.
Egwene sighed. Aviendha simply did not want to understand any customs but her own. The Aiel
woman was still shocked that Elayne would not ask Rand to marry her, that a man could ask that
question. “I’m sure the Wise Ones will listen to reason tomorrow. They can’t make you sleep in a
man’s bedchamber.”
The other woman looked at her in clear surprise. For a moment her grace left her, and she
stubbed a toe on the uneven ground; the mishap brought a few curses that would have made even
Kadere’s wagon drivers listen with interest—and made Bair reach for the bluespine—but she did not
stop running. “I do not understand why that upsets you so,” she said when the last curse died. “I have
slept next to a man many times on raids, even sharing blankets for warmth if the night was very cold,
but it disturbs you that I will sleep within ten feet of him. Is this part of your customs? I have noticed
you will not bathe in the sweat tent with men. Do you not trust Rand al’Thor? Or is it me you do not
trust?” Her voice had sunk to a concerned whisper by the end.
“Of course I trust you,” Egwene protested heatedly. “And him. It’s just that . . .” She trailed off,
uncertain how to go on. Aiel notions of propriety were sometimes stricter than what she had grown up
with, but in other ways they would have had the Women’s Circle back home trying to decide whether
to faint or reach for a stout stick. “Aviendha, if your honor is involved somehow . . .” This was
touchy ground. “Surely if you explain to the Wise Ones, they will not make you go against your
honor.”
“There is nothing to explain,” the other woman said flatly.
“I know I don’t understand ji’e’toh . . .” Egwene began, and Aviendha laughed.
“You say you do not understand, Aes Sedai, yet you show that you live by it.” Egwene regretted
maintaining that lie with her—it had been hard work to get Aviendha to call her simply Egwene, and
sometimes she slipped back—but it had to be kept with everyone if it was to hold with anyone. “You
are Aes Sedai, and strong enough in the Power to overcome Amys and Melaine together,” Aviendha
continued, “but you said that you would obey, so you scrub pots when they say scrub pots, and you run
when they say run. You may not know ji’e’toh, but you follow it.”
It was not the same thing at all, of course. She gritted her teeth and did as she was told because
that was the only way to learn dreamwalking, and she wanted to learn, to learn everything, more than
anything else she could imagine. To even think that she could live by this foolish ji’e’toh was simply
silly. She did what she had to do, and only when and because she had to.
They were coming back to where they had begun. As her foot hit the spot, Egwene said, “That’s
one,” and ran on through the darkness with no one to see but Aviendha, no one to say whether she

went back to her tent right then. Aviendha would not have told, but it never occurred to Egwene to
stop short of the fifty.

Gateways

Rand woke in total darkness and lay there beneath his blankets trying to think of what had
wakened him. It had been something. Not the dream; he had been teaching Aviendha how to swim, in
a pond in the Waterwood back home in the Two Rivers. Something else. Then it came again, like a
faint whiff of a foul miasma creeping under the door. Not a smell at all, really; a sense of otherness,
but that was how it felt. Rank, like something dead a week in stagnant water. It faded again, but not all
the way this time.
Tossing aside his blankets, he stood up, wrapping himself in saidin. Inside the Void, filled with
the Power, he could feel his body shiver, but the cold seemed in another place from where he was.
Cautiously he pulled open the door and stepped out. Arched windows at either end of the corridor let
in falls of moonlight. After the pitch black of his room, it was nearly like day. Nothing moved, but he
could feel . . . something . . . coming closer. Something evil. It felt like the taint that roared through
him on the Power.
One hand went to his coat pocket, to the small carved figure of a round little man holding a
sword across his knees. An angreal; with that he could channel more of the Power than even he could
safely handle unaided. He thought it would not be necessary. Whoever had sent this attack against him
did not know who they were dealing with, now. They should never have let him wake.
For a moment, he hesitated. He could take the fight to whatever had been sent against him, but he
thought it was still below him. Down where the Maidens were still sleeping, by the silence. With
luck, it would not bother them, unless he rushed down to battle it in their midst. That would surely
wake them, and they would not stand by and watch. Lan said that you should choose your ground, if
you could, and make your enemy come to you.
Smiling, he raced the thud of his boots up the nearest curving stairway, on upward, until he
reached the top floor. The highest level of the building was one large chamber with a slightly domed
ceiling and scattered thin columns fluted in spirals. Glassless arched windows all around flooded
every corner with moonlight. The dust and grit and sand on the floor still faintly showed his own
footprints, from the one time he had come up here, and no other mark. It was perfect.
Striding to the center of the room, he planted himself atop the mosaic there, the ancient symbol of
the Aes Sedai, ten feet across. It was an apt place. “Under this sign will he conquer.” That was what
the Prophecy of Rhuidean said of him. He stood straddling the sinuous dividing line, one boot on the
black teardrop that was now called the Dragon’s Fang and used to represent evil, the other on the
white now called the Flame of Tar Valon. Some men said it stood for the Light. An appropriate place
to meet this attack, between Light and darkness.
The fetid feel grew stronger, and a burned sulphur smell filled the air. Suddenly things moved,

slinking away from the stairs like moonshadows, along the outside of the room. Slowly they resolved
into three black dogs, darker than night and big as ponies. Eyes shining silver, they circled him
warily. With the Power in him, he could hear their hearts beat, like deep drums pounding. He could
not hear them breathe, though; perhaps they did not.
He channeled, and a sword was in his hands, its slightly curving, heron-marked blade seeming
hammered out of fire. He had expected Myrddraal, or something even worse than the Eyeless, but for
dogs, even Shadowspawn dogs, the sword would be enough. Whoever had sent them did not know
him. Lan said he had very nearly reached the level of a blademaster, now, and the Warder was
sparing enough with praise to make him think he might have passed on to that level already.
With snarls like bones being ground to dust, the dogs hurtled at him from three sides, faster than
galloping horses.
He did not move until they were almost on him; then he flowed, one with the sword, move to
move, as though dancing. In the blink of an eye the sword form called Whirlwind on the Mountain
became The Wind Blows Over the Wall became Unfolding the Fan. Great black heads flew apart
from black bodies, their dripping teeth, like burnished steel, still bared as they bounced across the
floor. He was already stepping from the mosaic as the dark forms collapsed in twitching, bleeding
heaps.
Laughing to himself, he let the sword go, though he held on to saidin, to the raging Power, the
sweetness and the taint. Contempt slid along the outside of the Void. Dogs. Shadowspawn, certainly,
but still just . . . Laughter died.
Slowly, the dead dogs and their heads were melting, settling into pools of liquid shadow that
quivered slightly, as if alive. Their blood, fanned across the floor, trembled. Suddenly the smaller
pools flowed across the floor in viscous streams to merge with the larger, which oozed away from the
mosaic to mound higher and higher, until the three huge black dogs stood there once more, slavering
and snarling as they gathered massive haunches under them.
He did not know why he felt surprise, dim outside the emptiness. Dogs, yes, but Shadowspawn.
Whoever had sent them had not been as careless as he had thought. But they still did not know him.
Instead of reaching for the sword again, he channeled as he remembered doing once long ago.
Howling, the huge dogs leaped, and a thick shaft of white light shot from his hands, like molten steel,
like liquid fire. He swept it across the springing creatures; for an instant they became strange
shadows of themselves, all colors reversed, and then they were made of sparkling motes that broke
apart, smaller and smaller, until there was nothing.
He let go of the thing he had made, with a grim smile. A purple bar of light still seemed to cross
his vision in afterimage.
Across the great chamber a piece of one of the columns crashed to the floor tiles. Where that bar
of light—or whatever it had been; not light, exactly—had swung, neat slices were gone from the
columns. A gaping swath cut half the width of the wall behind them.
“Did any of them bite you, or bleed on you?”
He spun at the sound of Moiraine’s voice; absorbed in what he had done, he had not heard her
come up the stairs. She stood clutching her skirts with both hands, peering at him, face lost in
moonshadow. She would have sensed the things the same way he did, but to be here so quickly she
must have run. “The Maidens let you pass? Have you become Far Dareis Mai, Moiraine?”
“They grant me some privileges of a Wise One,” she said in a rush, impatience raw in her
usually melodious voice. “I told the guards I had to speak with you urgently. Now, answer me! Did
the Darkhounds bite you, or bleed on you? Did their saliva touch you?”

“No,” he answered slowly. Darkhounds. The little he knew he had gotten from old stories, the
sort used to frighten children in the southlands. Some grown-ups believed, too. “Why should a bite
worry you? You could Heal it. Does this mean the Dark One is free?” Enclosed in the Void as he
was, even fear was distant.
The tales he had heard said the Darkhounds ran the night in the Wild Hunt, with the Dark One
himself the hunter; they left no print on even the softest dirt, only on stone, and they would not stop
until you faced and defeated them or put running water between you. Crossroads were supposed to be
particularly dangerous places to meet them, and the time just after sunset or just before sunrise. He
had seen enough old stories walking by now to believe that any of it could be true.
“No, not that, Rand.” She seemed to be regaining her self-control; her voice was silver chimes
again, calm and cool. “They are only another kind of Shadowspawn, something that should never have
been made. But their bite is death as surely as a dagger in the heart, and I do not think I could have
Healed such a wound before it killed you. Their blood, even their saliva, is poison. A drop on the
skin can kill, slowly, with great pain at the end. You are lucky there were only three. Unless you
killed more before I arrived? Their packs are usually larger, as many as ten or twelve, or so say the
scraps left from the War of the Shadow.”
Larger packs. He was not the only target in Rhuidean for one of the Forsaken. . . .
“We must speak of what you used to kill them,” Moiraine began, but he was already running as
hard as he could, ignoring her cries to know where he was going and why.
Down flights of stairs, through darkened corridors where sleepy Maidens, roused by the
pounding boots, peered at him in consternation from moonlit rooms. Through the front doors, where
Lan stood restlessly with the two women on guard, his color-shifting Warder’s cloak about his
shoulders, making parts of him seem to blend into the night.
“Where is Moiraine?” he shouted as Rand dashed by, but Rand leaped down the broad steps two
at a time without replying.
The half-healed wound in his side clenched like a fist, pain he was only vaguely aware of inside
the Void, by the time he reached the building he sought. It stood at the very edge of Rhuidean, far from
the plaza, as far from the camp Moiraine shared with the Wise Ones as it was possible to be and
remain in the city. The upper floors had collapsed in a mound of rubble that fanned out onto the
cracked earth beyond the pavement. Only the bottom two floors remained whole. Refusing his body’s
efforts to hunch over around the pain, he went in, still at a dead run.
Once the great antechamber, encircled by a stone balcony, had been tall; now it was taller, open
to the night sky, its pale stone floor strewn with rubble from the collapse. In the moonshadows
beneath the balcony, three Darkhounds were up on their hind legs, clawing and chewing at a bronzeclad door that shivered under their assault. The smell of burned sulphur hung strong in the air.
Remembering what had happened before, Rand darted to one side as he channeled, the shaft of
liquid white fire streaking by the door as it destroyed the Shadowspawn. He had tried to make it less
this time, to confine the destruction to the Darkhounds, but the thick wall at the far end of the chamber
had a shadowed hole in it. Not all the way through, he thought—it was hard to tell by moonlight—but
he would have to fine his control of this weapon.
The bronze sheathing on the door was tattered and torn as though the teeth and toenails of the
Darkhounds really had been steel; lamplight shone through a number of small holes. There were
pawprints in the floor-stones, but surprisingly few. Releasing saidin, he found a place where he
would not cut his hand to shreds and pounded on the door. Suddenly the pain in his side was very real
and present; he took a deep breath and tried to thrust it away. “Mat? It’s me, Rand! Open up, Mat!”

After a moment, the door opened a crack, letting out a spill of lamplight; Mat peered through
doubtfully, then pulled the door wider, leaning against it as if he had run ten miles carrying a sack of
rocks. Except for a silver foxhead medallion hanging around his neck, its eye shaped and shaded like
the ancient Aes Sedai symbol, he was naked. The way Mat felt about Aes Sedai, Rand was surprised
he had not sold the thing long since. Deeper in the room, a tall, golden-haired woman was calmly
wrapping a blanket around herself. A Maiden, by the spears and buckler lying at her feet.
Rand hastily averted his eyes and cleared his throat. “I just wanted to make sure you were all
right.”
“We’re fine.” Uneasily, Mat looked around the antechamber. “Now we are. You killed it, or
something? I don’t want to know what it was, as long as it’s gone. It’s bloody hard on a man
sometimes, being your friend.”
Not only a friend. Another ta’veren, and perhaps a key to victory in Tarmon Gai’don; anyone
who wanted to strike at Rand had reason to strike at Mat, as well. But Mat always tried to deny both
things. “They’re gone, Mat. Darkhounds. Three of them.”
“I told you I didn’t want to know,” Mat groaned. “Darkhounds now. I can’t say it isn’t always
something new around you. A man wouldn’t get bored; not until the day he died. If I hadn’t been on
my feet for a drink of wine when the door started to open . . .” He trailed off, shivering, and scratched
a red place on his right arm as he studied the ravaged metal sheathing. “You know, it’s funny how the
mind plays tricks. When I was putting everything I had into holding this door shut, I could have sworn
one of them had chewed a hole right through it. I could see its bloody head. And its teeth. Melindhra’s
spear didn’t even faze it.”
Moiraine’s arrival was more spectacular this time, running in, skirts held up, panting and fuming.
Lan was at her heels with his sword in hand and thunderclouds on his stone face, and right behind, a
throng of Far Dareis Mai that spilled out into the street. Some of the Maidens wore no more than
smallclothes, but every one held her spears alertly and had her shoufa wrapped around her head,
black veil hiding all but her eyes, ready to kill. Moiraine and Lan, at least, looked relieved to see him
standing there calmly talking to Mat, though the Aes Sedai also looked as if she meant to have strong
words with him. With the veils, it was impossible to tell what the Aiel thought.
Letting out a loud yelp, Mat darted back into his room and began hastily tugging on a pair of
breeches, his capering impeded by the way he kept trying to haul at the breeches and scratch his arm
at the same time. The golden-haired Maiden watched with a broad grin that threatened to break into
laughter.
“What’s the matter with your arm?” Rand asked.
“I told you the mind plays funny tricks,” Mat said, still trying to scratch and pull at the same
time. “When I thought that thing chewed through the door, I thought it slobbered all over my arm, too,
and now it bloody itches like fire. Even looks like a burn there.”
Rand opened his mouth, but Moiraine was already pushing past him. Staring at her, Mat fell
down while frantically dragging his breeches on the rest of the way, but she knelt beside him, ignoring
his protests, clasping his head in her hands. Rand had been Healed before, and seen it done, but
instead of what he expected, Mat only gave a shiver and lifted up the medallion by its leather thong so
that it hung against his hand.
“Bloody thing is colder than ice all of a sudden,” he muttered. “What are you doing, Moiraine? If
you want to do something, Heal this itch; it has my whole arm now.” His right arm was red from wrist
to shoulder, and had begun to look puffy.
Moiraine stared at him with the most startled expression Rand had ever seen on her face. Maybe

the only one. “I will,” she said slowly. “If the medallion is cold, take it off.”
Mat frowned at her, then finally pulled it over his head and laid it beside him. She took his head
again, and he gave a shout as if he had been ducked headfirst into ice; his legs stiffened and his back
arched; his eyes stared at nothing, as wide as they would go. When Moiraine took her hands away, he
slumped, gulping air. The redness and swelling were gone. It took three tries before he could speak.
“Blood and ashes! Does it have to be that flaming way every flaming time? It was just a bloody itch!”
“You watch your tongue with me,” Moiraine told him, getting up, “or I will find Nynaeve and put
her in charge of you.” But her heart was not in it; she could have been talking in her sleep. She was
trying not to stare at the foxhead as Mat hung it back around his neck. “You will need rest,” she said
absently. “Stay in bed tomorrow, if you feel like it.”
The Maiden in the blanket—Melindhra?—knelt behind Mat and put her hands on his shoulders,
looking up at Moiraine over his head. “I will see that he does as you say, Aes Sedai.” With a sudden
grin, she ruffled his hair. “He is my little mischief maker, now.” From the horrified look on Mat’s
face, he was gathering his strength to run.
Rand became aware of soft, amused chuckles behind him. The Maidens, shoufas and veils
around their shoulders now, had crowded around and were peering into the room.
“Teach him to sing, spear-sister,” Adelin said, and the other Maidens crowed with laughter.
Rand rounded on them firmly. “Let the man rest. Don’t some of you have to put on clothes?”
They gave way reluctantly, still trying to peer into the room, until Moiraine came out.
“Will you leave us, please?” the Aes Sedai said as the mangled door banged shut behind her.
She half looked back with a vexed tightening of her mouth. “I must speak with Rand al’Thor alone.”
Nodding, the Aiel women started for the door, some still jesting about whether Melindhra—a Shaido,
it seemed; Rand wondered if Mat knew that—would teach Mat to sing. Whatever that meant.
Rand stopped Adelin with a hand on her bare arm; others who noticed stopped as well, so he
spoke to them all. “If you will not go when I tell you to, what will you do if I have to use you in
battle?” He did not intend to if he could help it; he knew they were fierce warriors, but he had been
raised to believe it was a man’s place to die if necessary before a woman had to. Logic might say it
was foolish, especially with women like this, but that was how he felt. He knew better than to tell
them that, however. “Will you think it a joke, or decide to go in your own good time?”
They looked at him with the consternation of those listening to someone who had revealed his
ignorance of the simplest facts. “In the dance of spears,” Adelin told him, “we will go as you direct,
but this is not the dance. Besides, you did not tell us to go.”
“Even the Car’a’carn is not a wetlander king,” a gray-haired Maiden added. Sinewy and hard
despite her age, she wore only a short shift and her shoufa. He was getting tired of that phrase.
The Maidens resumed their joking as they left him alone with Moiraine and Lan. The Warder
had finally put up his sword, and looked as at ease as he ever did. Which was to say as still and calm
as his face, all stony planes and angles in the moonlight, and with an air of being on the brink of
sudden movement that made the Aiel appear placid in comparison. A braided leather cord held Lan’s
hair, graying at the temples, back from his face. His gaze could have come from a blue-eyed hawk.
“I must speak with you about—” Moiraine began.
“We can talk tomorrow,” Rand said, cutting her off. Lan’s face hardened further, if such was
possible; Warders were far more protective of their Aes Sedai, of their position as well as their
persons, than they were of themselves. Rand ignored Lan. His side still wanted to hunch him over, but
he managed to keep erect; he was not about to show her any weakness. “If you think I’ll help you get
that foxhead away from Mat, you can think again.” Somehow that medallion had stopped her

channeling. Or at least it had stopped her channeling from affecting Mat while he touched it. “He paid
a hard price for it, Moiraine, and it is his.” Thinking of how she had thumped his shoulders with the
Power, he added dryly, “Maybe I’ll ask if I can borrow it from him.” He turned away from her. There
was still one he had to check on, though one way or another the urgency was gone; the Darkhounds
would have done what they intended by now.
“Please, Rand,” Moiraine said, and the open pleading in her voice halted him in his tracks. He
had never heard anything like that from her before.
The tone seemed to offend Lan. “I thought you had become a man,” the Warder said harshly. “Is
this how a man behaves? You act like an arrogant boy.” Lan practiced the sword with him—and liked
him, Rand thought—but if Moiraine said the right word, the Warder would do his best to kill him.
“I will not be with you forever,” Moiraine said urgently. Her hands gripped her skirts so hard
that they trembled. “I might die in the next attack. I could fall from my horse and break my neck, or
take a Darkfriend’s arrow through my heart, and death cannot be Healed. I have given my entire life to
the search for you, to find you and help you. You still do not know your own strength; you cannot
know half of what you do. I—apologize—most humbly for any offense I have given you.” Those
words—words he had never thought to hear from her—came out as if dragged, but they came; and she
could not lie. “Let me help you as much as I can, while I can. Please.”
“It’s hard to trust you, Moiraine.” He disregarded Lan, shifting in the moonlight; his attention
was all on her. “You have handled me like a puppet, made me dance the way you wanted, from the
day we met. The only times I’ve been free of you were either when you were far away or when I
ignored you. And you make even that hard.”
Her laugh was as silvery as the moon above, but bitterness tinged it. “It has been more like
wrestling with a bear than pulling strings on a puppet. Do you want an oath not to try manipulating
you? I give it.” Her voice hardened to crystal. “I even swear to obey you like one of the Maidens—
like one of the gai’shain, if you require—but you must—” Taking a deep breath, she began again,
more softly. “I ask you, humbly, to allow me to help you.”
Lan was staring at her, and Rand thought his own eyes must be popping out of his head. “I will
accept your help,” he said slowly. “And I apologize, too. For all the rudeness I’ve shown.” He had
the feeling he was still being manipulated—he had had good cause to be rude, when he was—but she
could not lie.
Tension drained from her visibly. She stepped closer to look up at him. “What you used to kill
the Darkhounds is called balefire. I can still sense the residue of it here.” He could, too, like the
fading smell remaining after a pie was carried out of the room, or the memory of something just
snatched out of sight. “Since before the Breaking of the World, the use of balefire has been forbidden.
The White Tower forbids us even to learn it. In the War of Power, the Forsaken and the
Shadowsworn themselves used it only reluctantly.”
“Forbidden?” Rand said, frowning. “I saw you use it once.” He could not be sure in the pale
light of the moon, but he thought color flamed in her cheeks. For this once, perhaps she was the one
off balance.
“Sometimes it is necessary to do that which is forbidden.” If she was flustered, it did not show
in her voice. “When anything is destroyed with balefire, it ceases to exist before the moment of its
destruction, like a thread that burns away from where the flame touched it. The greater the power of
the balefire, the further back in time it ceases to exist. The strongest I can manage will remove only a
few seconds from the Pattern. You are much stronger. Very much so.”
“But if it doesn’t exist before you destroy it . . .” Rand raked fingers through his hair in

confusion.
“You begin to see the problems, the dangers? Mat remembers seeing one of the Darkhounds
chew through the door, but there is no opening, now. If it had slavered on him as much as he
remembers, he would have been dead before I could reach him. For as far back as you destroyed the
creature, whatever it did during that time no longer happened. Only the memories remain, for those
who saw or experienced it. Only what it did before is real, now. A few tooth holes in the door, and
one drop of saliva on Mat’s arm.”
“That sounds just fine to me,” he told her. “Mat’s alive because of it.”
“It is terrible, Rand.” An urgent note entered her voice. “Why do you think even the Forsaken
feared to use it? Think of the effect on the Pattern of a single thread, one man, removed from hours, or
days, that have already been woven, like one thread picked partly out of a piece of cloth. Fragments
of manuscripts remaining from the War of Power say several entire cities were destroyed with
balefire before both sides realized the dangers. Hundreds of thousands of threads pulled from the
Pattern, gone for days already past; whatever those people had done, now no longer had been done,
and neither had what others had done because of their actions. The memories remained, but not the
actions. The ripples were incalculable. The Pattern itself nearly unraveled. It could have been the
destruction of everything. World, time, Creation itself.”
Rand shivered, nothing to do with the cold cutting through his coat. “I can’t promise not to use it
again, Moiraine. You yourself said there are times when it’s necessary to do what’s forbidden.”
“I did not think that you would,” she said coolly. Her agitation was vanishing, her balance
restored. “But you must be careful.” She was back to “must” again. “With a sa’angreal like
Callandor, you could annihilate a city with balefire. The Pattern could be disrupted for years to
come. Who can say that the weave would even remain centered on you, ta’veren as you are, until it
settled down? Being ta’veren, and so strongly so, may be your margin of victory, even in the Last
Battle.”
“Perhaps it will,” he said bleakly. In tale after heroic tale, the protagonist proclaimed he would
have victory or death. It seemed that the best he could hope for was victory and death. “I have to
check on someone,” he went on quietly. “I will see you in the morning.” Gathering the Power into
him, life and death in swirling layers, he made a hole in the air taller than he was, opening into
blackness that made the moonlight seem day. A gateway, Asmodean called it.
“What is that?” Moiraine gasped.
“Once I’ve done something, I remember how. Most of the time.” That was no answer, but it was
time to test Moiraine’s vows. She could not lie, but Aes Sedai could find loopholes in a stone. “You
are to leave Mat alone tonight. And you won’t try to take that medallion away from him.”
“It belongs in the Tower for study, Rand. It must be a ter’angreal, but none has ever been found
that—”
“Whatever it is,” he said firmly, “it is his. You will leave it with him.”
For a moment she seemed to struggle with herself, back stiffening and head coming up as she
stared at him. She could not be used to taking orders from anyone except Siuan Sanche, and Rand was
willing to wager she had never done that without a tussle. Finally she nodded, and even made the
suggestion of a curtsy. “As you say, Rand. It is his. Please be careful, Rand. Learning a thing like
balefire by yourself can be suicide, and death cannot be Healed.” This time there was no mockery.
“Until the morning.” Lan followed her as she left, the Warder giving Rand an unreadable expression;
he would not be pleased by this turn of events.
Rand stepped through the gateway, and it vanished.

He was standing on a disc, a six-foot copy of the ancient Aes Sedai symbol. Even the black half
of it seemed lighter against the endless darkness that surrounded him, above and below; he was sure
that if he fell off, he would fall forever. Asmodean claimed there was a faster method, called
Traveling, for using a gateway, but he had not been able to teach it, partly because he did not have the
strength to make a gateway while wearing Lanfear’s shield. In any case, Traveling required that you
know your starting point very well. It seemed more logical to him that you should have to know where
you were heading well, but Asmodean seemed to think that that was like asking why air was not
water. There was a great deal that Asmodean took for granted. Anyway, Skimming was fast enough.
As soon as he planted his boots on it, the disc lurched what seemed to be a foot and stopped,
another gateway appearing in front of it. Fast enough, especially over this short distance. Rand
stepped into the hallway outside the room where Asmodean was.
The moon through the windows at the ends of the corridor gave the only light; Asmodean’s lamp
was out. The flows he had woven around the room were still in place, still firmly tied. Nothing
moved, but there was still a faint smell of burned sulphur.
Moving close to the bead curtain, he peered through the doorway. Moonshadows filled the room,
but one of them was Asmodean, tossing in his blankets. Wrapped in the Void, Rand could hear his
heartbeat, smell the sweat of troubled dreams. He bent to examine the pale blue floor tiles, and the
prints impressed in them.
He had learned to track as a boy, and reading them was no difficulty. Three or four Darkhounds
had been there. They had approached the doorway one by one, it seemed, each stepping almost in the
others’ footprints. Had the net woven around the room stopped them there? Or had they merely been
sent to look, and report? Troubling to think of even Shadowspawn dogs having that much intelligence.
But then, Myrddraal used ravens and rats for spies, too, and other animals closely linked to death.
Shadoweyes, the Aiel called them.
Channeling fine flows of Earth, he smoothed out the floor tiles, lifting up the compressions until
he was out in the empty, night-cloaked street and a hundred paces from the tall building. In the
morning, anyone would be able to see the trail ending there, but none would suspect that the
Darkhounds had gone anywhere near Asmodean. Darkhounds could have no interest in Jasin Natael
the gleeman.
Every Maiden in the city was likely awake by this time; certainly none would still be asleep
under the Roof of the Maidens. Making another gateway there in the street, a deeper blackness against
the night, he let the disc carry him back to his own room. He wondered why he had chosen the ancient
symbol—it was his choice, if unconscious; other times it had been a stairstep or a piece of floor. The
Darkhounds had oozed away from that sign before re-forming. Under this sign will he conquer.
Standing in his pitch-black bedchamber, he channeled the lamps alight, but he did not let go of
saidin. Instead he channeled again, careful not to spring any of his own traps, and a piece of the wall
vanished, revealing a niche he had carved there himself.
In the little alcove stood two figurines a foot tall, a man and a woman, each in flowing robes and
serene of face, each holding a crystal globe aloft in one hand. He had lied to Asmodean about them.
There were angreal, like the round little man in Rand’s coat pocket, and sa’angreal, like
Callandor, that increased the amount of the Power that could be safely handled as much over angreal
as angreal did over channeling unaided. Both were very rare, and prized by Aes Sedai, though they
could only recognize those attuned to women and saidar. These two figures were something else, not
so rare, but just as highly valued. Ter’angreal had been made to use the Power not to magnify it, but
to use it in specific ways. The Aes Sedai did not know the intended purpose even of most ter’angreal

they had in the White Tower; some they used, but without knowing whether the use they put them to
was anything like the function they had been made for. Rand knew the function of these two.
The male figure could link him to a huge replica of itself, the most powerful male sa’angreal
ever made, even if he were on the other side of the Aryth Ocean from it. It had only been finished
after the Dark One’s prison was resealed—How do I know that?—and hidden before any of the male
Aes Sedai going mad could find it. The female figure could do the same for a woman, joining her to
the female equivalent of the great statue he hoped was still almost completely buried in Cairhien.
With that much power . . . Moiraine had said death could not be Healed.
Unbidden, unwanted, memory returned of the next-to-last time he had dared let himself hold
Callandor, images floating beyond the Void.
The body of the dark-haired girl, little more than a child, lay sprawled with eyes wide and
fixed on the ceiling, blood blackening the bosom of her dress where a Trolloc had run her through.
The Power was in him. Callandor blazed, and he was the Power. He channeled, directing
flows into the child’s body, searching, trying, fumbling; she lurched to her feet, arms and legs
unnaturally rigid and jerky.
“Rand, you cannot do this,” Moiraine cried. “Not this!”
Breathe. She had to breathe. The girl’s chest rose and fell. Heart. Had to beat. Blood already
thick and dark oozed from the wound in her chest. Live, burn you! his mind howled. I didn’t mean to
be too late! Her eyes stared at him, filmed, heedless of all the Power in him. Lifeless. Tears
trickled unheeded down his cheeks.
He forced the memory away roughly; even encased in the Void, it hurt. With this much Power . . .
With this much Power, he could not be trusted. “You are not the Creator,” Moiraine had told him as
he stood over that child. But with that male figure, with only half of its power, he had made the
mountains move, once. With far less, with only Callandor, he had been sure he could turn back the
Wheel, make a dead child live. Not only the One Power was seductive; the power of it was, too. He
should destroy them both. Instead he rewove the flows, reset the traps.
“What are you doing there?” a woman’s voice said as the wall became apparently whole again.
Tying off the flows hastily—and the knot with its own deadly surprises—he pulled the Power
into him and turned.
Beside Lanfear, in her white and silver, Elayne or Min or Aviendha would look almost ordinary.
Her dark eyes alone were enough to make a man give up his soul. At the sight of her, his stomach
clenched until he wanted to vomit.
“What do you want?” he demanded. Once he had blocked Egwene and Elayne both from the True
Source, but he could not remember how. So long as Lanfear could touch the Source, he had more
chance of catching the wind in his hands than of holding her prisoner. One flash of balefire, and . . .
He could not do it. She was one of the Forsaken, but the memory of a woman’s head rolling on the
ground stopped him dead.
“You have two of them,” she said finally. “I thought I glimpsed . . . One is a woman, isn’t it?”
Her smile could have halted a man’s heart and made him grateful. “You are beginning to consider my
plan, aren’t you? With those, together, the other Chosen will kneel at our feet. We can supplant the
Great Lord himself, challenge the Creator. We—”
“You were always ambitious, Mierin.” His voice grated in his ears. “Why do you think I turned
away from you? It wasn’t Ilyena, whatever you like to think. You were out of my heart long before
ever I met her. Ambition is all there is to you. Power is all you ever wanted. You disgust me!”
She stared at him, both hands pressed hard against her stomach, her dark eyes even larger than

usual. “Graendal said . . .” she began faintly. Swallowing, she began again. “Lews Therin? I love
you, Lews Therin. I have always loved you, and I always will. You know that. You must!”
Rand’s face was like rock; he hoped it hid his shock. He had no idea where his words had come
from, but it seemed he could remember her. A dim memory, from before. I am not Lews Therin
Telamon! “I am Rand al’Thor!” he said harshly.
“Of course you are.” Studying him, she nodded slowly to herself. That cool composure returned.
“Of course. Asmodean has been telling you things, about the War of Power, and me. He lies. You did
love me. Until that yellow-haired trollop Ilyena stole you.” For an instant, rage made her face a
contorted mask; he did not think she was even aware of it. “Did you know that Asmodean severed his
own mother? What they call stilling, now. Severed her, and let Myrddraal drag her away screaming.
Can you trust a man like that?”
Rand laughed aloud. “After I caught him, you helped trap him so he had to teach me. And now
you say I cannot trust him?”
“For teaching.” She sniffed dismissively. “He will do that because he knows his lot is cast with
you for good. Even if he managed to convince the others that he has been a prisoner, they would still
tear him apart, and he knows it. The weakest dog in the pack often suffers that fate. Besides, I watch
his dreams on occasion. He dreams of you triumphing over the Great Lord and putting him up beside
you on high. Sometimes he dreams of me.” Her smile said those dreams were pleasant for her, but not
so for Asmodean. “But he will try to turn you against me.”
“Why are you here?” he demanded. Turn against her? No doubt she was full of the Power right
that moment, ready to shield him if she even suspected he meant to try anything. She had done it
before, with humiliating ease.
“I like you like this. Arrogant and proud, full of your own strength.”
Once she had said that she liked him unsure, that Lews Therin had been too arrogant. “Why are
you here?”
“Rahvin sent the Darkhounds after you tonight,” she said calmly, folding her hands at her waist.
“I would have come sooner, to help you, but I cannot let the others know I am on your side yet.”
On his side. One of the Forsaken loved him, or rather the man he had been three thousand years
ago, and all she wanted was for him to give his soul to the Shadow and rule the world with her. Or a
step below her, at least. That, and try to replace both the Dark One and the Creator. Was she
completely mad? Or could the power of those two huge sa’angreal really be as great as she claimed?
That was a direction he did not want his thoughts to take.
“Why would Rahvin choose now to attack me? Asmodean says he looks to his own interests, that
he’ll sit to one side even in the Last Battle, if he can, and wait for the Dark One to destroy me. Why
not Sammael, or Demandred? Asmodean says they hate me.” Not me. They hate Lews Therin. But to
the Forsaken, that was the same thing. Please, Light, I am Rand al’Thor. He pushed away a sudden
memory of this woman in his arms, both of them young and just learning what they could do with the
Power. I am Rand al’Thor! “Why not Semirhage, or Moghedien, or Graen—?”
“But you are impinging on his interests now.” She laughed. “Don’t you know where he is? In
Andor, in Caemlyn itself. He rules there in all but name. Morgase simpers and dances for him, her
and half a dozen others.” Her lip curled in disgust. “He has men scouring town and countryside to find
new pretties for him.”
For a moment shock held him. Elayne’s mother in the hands of one of the Forsaken. Yet he dared
not show concern. Lanfear had displayed her jealousy more than once; she was capable of hunting
Elayne down and killing her, if she even thought he had feelings for her. What do I feel for her?

Aside from that, one hard fact floated beyond the Void, cold and cruel in its truth. He would not run
off to attack Rahvin even if what Lanfear said was true. Forgive me, Elayne, but I can’t. She might
well be lying—she would weep no tears for any of the other Forsaken he killed; they all stood in the
way of her own plans—but in any event, he was done with reacting to what others did. If he reacted,
they could reason out what he would do. Let them react to him, and be as surprised as Lanfear and
Asmodean had been.
“Does Rahvin think I’ll rush to defend Morgase?” he said. “I have seen her once in my life. The
Two Rivers is part of Andor on a map, but I never saw a Queen’s Guardsman there. No one has in
generations. Tell a Two Rivers man Morgase is his queen, and he’ll probably think you’re crazy.”
“I doubt Rahvin expects you to run to defend your homeland,” Lanfear said wryly, “but he will
expect you to defend your ambitions. He means to sit Morgase on the Sun Throne, too, and use her
like a puppet until the time he can come into the open. More Andoran soldiers move into Cairhien
every day. And you sent Tairen soldiers north, to secure your own hold on the land. No wonder that
he attacked you as soon as he found you.”
Rand shook his head. It had not been that way at all, sending the Tairens, but he did not expect
her to understand. Or believe him if he told her, for that matter. “I thank you for the warning.”
Politeness to one of the Forsaken! Of course, there was nothing he could do except hope that some of
what she told him was truth. A good reason not to kill her. She’ll tell you more than she thinks, if
you listen carefully. He hoped that was his own thought, chill and cynical as it was.
“You ward your dreams against me.”
“Against everyone.” That was simple truth, though she was at least as prominent in the list as the
Wise Ones.
“Dreams are mine. You and your dreams are mine especially.” Her face remained smooth, but
her voice hardened. “I can break through your warding. You would not like it.”
To show his unconcern, he sat down on the foot of his pallet, legs folded and hands on his knees.
He thought his face was as calm as hers. Inside him, the Power swelled. He had flows of Air ready to
bind her, and flows of Spirit. That was what wove a shield against the True Source. The racking of
his brain for the how of it seemed far off, but he could not remember anyway. Without that, the other
was useless. She could pick apart or slice through anything he wove, even if she could not see it.
Asmodean was trying to teach him that trick, but it was hard going without a woman’s weaving to
practice on.
Lanfear eyed him in a disconcerted fashion, a slight frown marring her beauty. “I have examined
the Aielwomen’s dreams. These so-called Wise Ones. They do not know how to shield themselves
very well. I could frighten them till they never dream again, never even think of invading yours
surely.”
“I thought you would not help me openly.” He did not dare tell her to leave the Wise Ones alone;
she might well do something to spite him. She had made it plain from the start, if not in words, that
she meant to have the upper hand between them. “Wouldn’t that risk another of the Forsaken finding
out? You aren’t the only one who knows how to enter people’s dreams.”
“The Chosen,” she said absently. For a moment she chewed a full underlip. “I have watched the
girl’s dreams, too. Egwene. Once I thought you had feelings for her. Do you know who she dreams
of? Morgase’s son and stepson. The son, Gawyn, most often.” Smiling, she put on a tone of mock
shock. “You would not believe a simple country girl could have such dreams.”
She was trying to test his jealousy, he realized. She really thought he warded his dreams to hide
thoughts of another woman! “The Maidens guard me closely,” he said dryly. “If you want to know

how close, look at Isendre’s dreams.”
Spots of color flared in her cheeks. Of course. He was not supposed to see what she was trying.
Confusion rolled outside the Void. Or did she think . . . ? Isendre? Lanfear knew she was a
Darkfriend. Lanfear had brought Kadere and the woman to the Waste in the first place. And planted
most of the jewelry Isendre was accused of stealing; Lanfear’s spite was cruel even when petty. Still,
if she thought he could love her, Isendre being a Darkfriend was probably no obstacle in her eyes.
“I should have let them send her off to try reaching the Dragonwall,” he went on casually, “but
who knows what she might have said to save herself? I must protect her and Kadere to some extent in
order to protect Asmodean.”
The color faded, but as she opened her mouth again, a knock came at the door. Rand bounded to
his feet. No one would recognize Lanfear, yet if a woman were discovered in his room, a woman
whom none of the Maidens below had seen enter, questions would be asked and he had no answers.
But Lanfear already had a gateway open, to somewhere full of white silk hangings and silver.
“Remember that I am your only hope of surviving, my love.” It was a very cool voice in which to call
someone that. “Beside me, you need fear nothing. Beside me, you can rule—everything that is or will
be.” Lifting her snowy skirts, she stepped through, and the gateway winked shut.
The knock sounded again before he could make himself push away saidin and haul open the
door.
Enaila peered past him suspiciously, muttering, “I thought perhaps Isendre. . . .” She gave him an
accusing look. “Spear-sisters are searching everywhere for you. No one saw you return.” With a
shake of her head, she straightened; she always tried to stand as tall as possible. “The chiefs have
come to speak with the Car’a’carn,” she said formally. “They wait below.”
They waited on the columned portico, as it turned out, being men. The sky was still dark, but the
first glimmers of dawn lined the mountains to the east. If they felt any impatience with the two
Maidens who stood between them and the tall doors, it did not show on their shadowed faces.
“The Shaido are moving,” Han barked as soon as Rand appeared. “And the Reyn, the Miagoma,
the Shiande. . . . Every clan!”
“Joining Couladin, or me?” Rand demanded.
“The Shaido are moving toward the Jangai Pass,” Rhuarc said. “For the others, it is too early to
tell. But they are on the march with every spear not needed to defend the holds, herds and flocks.”
Rand only nodded. All of his determination not to let anyone else dictate what he would do, and
now this. Whatever the other clans intended, Couladin had to plan a crossing into Cairhien. So much
for his grand schemes of imposing peace, if the Shaido ravaged Cairhien even further while he sat in
Rhuidean waiting for the other clans.
“Then we move for the Jangai, too,” he said finally.
“We cannot catch him if he means to cross,” Erim cautioned, and Han added sourly, “If any of
the others are joining him, we will be caught strung out like blindworms in the sun.”
“I won’t sit here until I find out,” Rand said. “If I can’t catch Couladin, I mean to be right behind
him into Cairhien. Rouse the spears. We leave as soon after first light as you can manage.”
Giving him that odd Aiel bow used only on the most formal occasions, one foot forward and one
hand extended, the chiefs departed. Only Han said anything. “To Shayol Ghul itself.”

CHAPTER
7
A Departure

Yawning in the early-morning grayness, Egwene pulled herself up onto her fog-colored mare,
then had to handle her reins smartly as Mist frisked about. The animal had not been ridden in weeks.
Aiel not only preferred their own legs, they avoided riding almost completely, though they did use
packhorses and pack mules. Even if there had been enough wood to build wagons, the terrain in the
Waste was not hospitable to wheels, as more than one peddler had learned to his or her sorrow.
She was not looking forward to the long journey west. The mountains hid the sun now, but the
heat would grow by the hour once it climbed clear, and there would be no convenient tent to duck into
at nightfall. She was not certain that Aiel garb was suitable for riding, either. The shawl, worn over
her head, always did a surprisingly good job of keeping the sun off, but those bulky skirts would bare
her legs to the thigh if she was not careful. Blisters worried her as much as modesty. The sun on one
side, and . . . A month out of the saddle should not have softened her that much. She hoped it had not,
or this would be a very long journey.
Once she had settled Mist down, Egwene found Amys looking at her, and shared a smile with the
Wise One. All of that running the night before was not the reason she was still sleepy; if anything, it
had helped her sleep even more soundly. She had found the other woman’s dreams last night, and in
celebration they had sipped tea in the dream, in Cold Rocks Hold, early on an evening when children
were playing among the crop-planted terraces and a pleasant breeze blew down the valley as the sun
sank.
Of course, that would not have been enough to steal her rest, but she had been so exultant that
when she left Amys’ dreams, she did not stop; she could not, not then, no matter what Amys would
have said. There had been dreams all around, though with most she had no idea whose they were.
With most, not all. Melaine had been dreaming of suckling a babe at her breast, and Bair of one of her
dead husbands, both of them young and yellow-haired. She had been especially careful not to enter
those; the Wise Ones would have known an intruder in an instant, and she shuddered to think of what
they would have done before letting her go.
Rand’s dreams had been a challenge, of course, one she could not fail to face. Now that she
could flit from dream to dream, how could she not try where the Wise Ones failed? Only, attempting
to enter his dreams had been like running headlong into an invisible stone wall. She knew that his
dreams lay on the other side, and she was sure she could find a way through, but there had been
nothing to work on, nothing to pry at. A wall of nothing. It was a problem she meant to worry at until
she solved it. Once she put her mind on something, she could be as persistent as a badger.
All around her gai’shain were bustling about, loading the Wise Ones’ camp onto mules. Before
long, only an Aiel or someone just as skilled at tracking would be able to tell there had ever been
tents on that patch of hard clay. The same activity covered the surrounding mountain slopes, and the

hubbub extended into the city, as well. Not everyone would be going, but thousands would. Aiel
thronged the streets, and Master Kadere’s train of wagons stood strung out across the great plaza,
laden with Moiraine’s selections, the three white-painted water wagons at the end of the line like
huge barrels on wheels behind twenty-mule teams. Kadere’s own wagon, at the head of the column,
was a little white house on wheels, with steps at the back and a metal stovepipe sticking out of the flat
roof. The thick, hawk-nosed merchant, all in ivory-colored silk today, swept off his incongruously
battered hat as she rode past, his dark, tilted eyes not sharing in the wide smile he flashed at her.
She ignored him frostily. His dreams had been decidedly dark and unpleasant, where they were
not lewd as well. He ought to have his head dunked in a cask of bluespine tea, she thought grimly.
Approaching the Roof of the Maidens, she threaded her way through scurrying gai’shain and
patiently standing mules. To her surprise, one of those loading the Maidens’ things wore a black robe,
not white. A woman, by the size of her, and staggering under the weight of a cord-tied bundle on her
back. Bending as she guided Mist past, to get a look inside the woman’s cowl, Egwene saw Isendre’s
haggard face, sweat already rolling down her cheeks. She was glad the Maidens had stopped letting
the woman go outside—or sending her out—more naked than not, but it did seem needlessly cruel to
robe her in black. If she was sweating so hard already, she would nearly die once the day’s heat took
hold.
Still, Far Dareis Mai business was none of hers. Aviendha had told her so gently but firmly.
Adelin and Enaila had been little short of rude about it, and a wiry, white-haired Maiden named Sulin
had actually threatened to haul her back to the Wise Ones by her ear. Despite her efforts to persuade
Aviendha to stop addressing her as “Aes Sedai,” it had been irritating to find that after walking a fine
line of uncertainty toward her, the rest of the Maidens had come down on the side of her being just
another pupil of the Wise Ones. Why, they would not even let her past the door of the Roof unless she
claimed to be on an errand.
The quickness with which she heeled Mist on through the crowd had nothing to do with
acceptance of Far Dareis Mai justice, or her uncomfortable awareness that some of the Maidens
were eyeing her, no doubt ready to lecture if they thought she intended to interfere. It even had little to
do with her dislike of Isendre. She did not want to think about her glimpse of the woman’s dreams,
just before Cowinde had come to rouse her. They had been nightmares of torture, of things being done
to the woman that sent Egwene fleeing in horror, and with something dark and evil laughing as it
watched her run. No wonder Isendre looked haggard. Egwene had started up out of her sleep so
quickly that Cowinde had jumped back from laying a hand on her shoulder.
Rand was in the street in front of the Maidens’ Roof, wearing a shoufa against the coming sun
and a blue silk coat with enough gold embroidery to befit a palace, though it hung open halfway down
the front. His belt had a new buckle, an elaborate thing shaped like a Dragon. He really was
beginning to think a great deal of himself, that was clear. Standing beside Jeade’en, his dappled
stallion, he was talking with the clan chiefs and some of the Aiel traders who would be staying in
Rhuidean.
Jasin Natael, nearly at Rand’s heels, with his harp on his back and holding the reins of a saddled
mule bought from Master Kadere, was even more elaborately dressed, with silver embroidery nearly
hiding his black coat, and spills of white lace at his neck and cuffs. Even his boots were worked in
silver where they turned down at the knee. The gleeman’s cloak with its patches did spoil the effect,
but gleemen were odd folk.
The male traders wore the cadin’sor, and though their belt knives were smaller than those of
warriors, Egwene knew they could all handle a spear if called to; they had something, if not all, of the

deadly grace of their brothers who carried the spear. The women traders, in loose white algode
blouses and full woolen skirts, head scarves and shawls, were more easily distinguishable. Except
for Maidens and gai’shain—and Aviendha—Aielwomen all wore multiple bracelets and necklaces
of gold and ivory, silver and gemstones, some of Aiel make, some traded for, and some looted.
Among Aiel traders, though, the women displayed twice as many, if not more.
She caught part of what Rand was telling the traders.
“. . . give the Ogier stonemasons a free hand on some of what they build, at least. On as much as
you can make yourselves. There’s no point in just trying to remake the past.”
So he was having them send to the stedding for Ogier to rebuild Rhuidean. That was good. Much
of Tar Valon was Ogier work, and where they were left to their own devices their buildings were
enough to take the breath away.
Mat was already up on his gelding, Pips, with his wide-brimmed hat pulled down and the butt of
that odd spear resting on his stirrup. As usual, his high-collared green coat looked slept in. She had
avoided his dreams. One of the Maidens, a very tall golden-haired woman, gave Mat a roguish grin
that seemed to embarrass him. And well it should; she was much too old for him. Egwene sniffed, I
know very well what he was dreaming about, thank you very much! She only reined in beside him to
look around for Aviendha.
“He told her to be quiet, and she did,” he said as she halted Mist. He nodded toward Moiraine
and Lan, she in pale blue silk, gripping the reins of her white mare, and he in his Warder’s cloak,
holding his great black warhorse. Lan was watching Moiraine intently, expressionless as always,
while she looked ready to burst with impatience as she glared at Rand. “She started telling him why
this is the wrong thing to do—sounded to me like she was saying it for the hundredth time—and he
said, ‘I’ve decided, Moiraine. Stand over there and be quiet till I have time for you.’ Like he
expected her to do as she was told. And she did. Is that steam coming out of her ears?”
His chortle was so pleased, so amused at his own wit, that she nearly embraced saidar and
taught him a lesson right there in front of everybody. Instead she sniffed again, loudly enough to let
him know it was for him and his wit and his amusement. He gave her a wry, sidelong look, and
chuckled again, which did nothing for her temper.
For a moment she stared at Moiraine, perplexed. The Aes Sedai had done as Rand told her?
Without protest? That was like one of the Wise Ones obeying, or the sun rising at midnight. She had
heard about the attack, of course; rumors about giant dogs that left footprints on stone had been all
over this morning. She could not see what that could have to do with this, but aside from the news of
the Shaido it was the only new thing she knew of, and not enough to produce this reaction. Nothing
could produce it, that she could think of. Doubtless Moiraine would tell her it was none of her
concern, but one way or another she would worry it out. She did not like not understanding things.
Spotting Aviendha, standing on the bottom step of the Roof, she guided Mist around to the other
side of the crowd near Rand. The Aiel woman was staring at him as hard as the Aes Sedai did, but
with absolutely no expression. She kept turning the ivory bracelet on her wrist over and over,
apparently without realizing it. Somehow or other that bracelet was part of the difficulty the woman
was having with him. Egwene did not understand; Aviendha refused to talk about it, and she could not
just ask someone else, not when it might embarrass her friend. Her own flame-carved ivory bracelet
was a gift from Aviendha, to seal them as near-sisters; her return gift had been the silver necklace the
other woman wore, which Master Kadere claimed was a Kandori pattern called snowflakes. She had
had to ask Moiraine for enough money, but it had seemed appropriate for a woman who would never
see snow. Or would not have if she was not leaving the Waste; small chance that she could return

before winter. Whatever that bracelet meant, Egwene was confident she could puzzle it out
eventually.
“Are you all right?” she asked. As she leaned out of her high-cantled saddle, her skirts shifted
till her legs showed, but she was concerned enough with her friend to hardly notice.
She had to repeat the question before Aviendha gave a start and stared up at her. “All right? Of
course I am.”
“Let me speak to the Wise Ones, Aviendha. I’m sure I can convince them that they cannot just
make you . . .” She could not make herself say it, not out here where anyone in the crowd might hear.
“Does that still worry you?” Aviendha shifted her gray shawl and gave a small shake of her
head. “Your customs are still very strange to me.” Her eyes drifted back to Rand like iron filings
drawn to a lodestone.
“You do not have to be afraid of him.”
“I am not afraid of any man,” the other woman snapped, eyes flashing blue-green fire. “I want no
trouble between us, Egwene, but you should not say such things.”
Egwene sighed. Friend or not, Aviendha was quite capable of trying to box her ears when
offended enough. In any case, she was not sure she would have admitted it, either. Aviendha’s dream
had been too painful to watch for long. Naked but for that ivory bracelet, and that seeming to drag at
her as if it weighed a hundred pounds, Aviendha had been running as hard as she could across a
cracked clay flat. And behind her, Rand came, a giant twice the size of an Ogier on a huge Jeade’en,
slowly but inexorably catching up.
But you could not simply tell a friend that she was lying. Egwene’s face reddened slightly.
Especially not when you would have to tell her how you knew. She would box my ears, then. I won’t
do it again. Go rummaging about in people’s dreams. Not in Aviendha’s dreams, anyway. It was
not right to spy on a friend’s dreams. Not that it was spying, exactly, but still . . .
The crowd around Rand was beginning to break up. He swung into his saddle easily, imitated
promptly by Natael. One of the traders, a broad-faced, flame-haired woman wearing a small fortune
in worked gold, cut gems and carved ivory, lingered, though. “Car’a’carn, do you mean to leave the
Three-fold Land forever? You have spoken as if you will never return.”
The others stopped at that and turned back. Silence spread on an expanding ripple of murmurs
telling what had been asked.
For a moment Rand was silent as well, looking around at the faces turned to him. At last he said,
“I hope to return, but who can say what will happen? The Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills.” He
hesitated, with every eye on him. “But I will leave you something to remember me by,” he added,
sticking a hand in his coat pocket.
Abruptly a fountain near the Roof burst to life, water gushing from the mouths of incongruous
porpoises standing on their tails. Beyond that, a statue of a young man with a horn raised to the sky
suddenly was putting up a spreading fan, and then two stone women farther on were casting sprays of
water from their hands. In stunned stillness the Aiel watched as all the fountains of Rhuidean flowed
once more.
“I should have done that long since.” Rand’s mutter was no doubt meant for himself, but in the
hush Egwene could hear him quite clearly. The splash of hundreds of fountains was the only other
sound. Natael shrugged as if he had expected no less.
It was at Rand that Egwene stared, not the fountains. A man who could channel. Rand. He’s still
Rand, despite everything. But each time she saw him do it was like learning that he could all over
again. Growing up, she had been taught that only the Dark One was more to be feared than a man who

could channel. Maybe Aviendha’s right to be afraid of him.
But when she looked down at Aviendha, open wonder shone on her face; so much water
delighted the Aiel woman as the finest silk dress might have Egwene, or a garden full of flowers.
“It is time to march,” Rand announced, reining the dapple westward. “Anyone who isn’t ready
will have to catch up.” Natael followed close behind on the mule. Why did Rand let such a bootlicker
stay near him?
The clan chiefs immediately began passing orders, and the bustle increased tenfold. Maidens and
Water Seekers darted ahead, and more Far Dareis Mai closed around Rand as a guard of honor,
incidentally enclosing Natael. Aviendha strode beside Jeade’en, right at Rand’s stirrup, easily
matching the stallion stride for stride even in her bulky skirts.
Falling in beside Mat, behind Rand and his escort, Egwene frowned. Her friend wore that look
of grim determination again, as if she had to put her arm into a viper den. I have to do something to
help her. Egwene did not give up on a problem once she had her teeth into it.
Settling herself in her saddle, Moiraine patted Aldieb’s arched neck with a gloved hand, but she
did not immediately follow Rand. Hadnan Kadere was bringing his wagons up the street, driving the
lead wagon himself. She should have made him tear that wagon down to carry cargo as she had the
other like it; the man was frightened enough of her, of Aes Sedai, to have done it. The doorframe
ter’angreal was lashed firmly in the wagon behind Kadere, canvas tied over it tightly so no one
could fall through by accident again. A long line of Aiel—Seia Doon, Black Eyes—strode along on
either side of the wagon train.
Kadere bowed to her from the driver’s seat, but her gaze swept on down to the line of wagons,
all the way to the great square surrounding the forest of slim glass columns, already sparkling in the
morning light. She would have taken everything in the plaza if she could, rather than the small fraction
that would fit into the wagons. Some were too large. Like the three dull gray metal rings, each more
than two paces across, standing on edge and joined at the middle. A braided leather rope had been
strung around that one, to warn all from entering without the Wise Ones’ permission. Not that anyone
was likely to, of course. Only the clan chiefs and the Wise Ones entered that square with any sense of
ease; only the Wise Ones touched anything, and they with something approaching proper reticence.
For countless years the second test faced by an Aiel woman who wanted to be a Wise One had
been to enter the array of glittering glass columns, seeing exactly what the men saw. More women
survived it than men—Bair said it was because women were tougher, Amys that those too weak to
survive were winnowed out before reaching that point—but it was not a certainty. Those who did
survive were not marked. The Wise Ones claimed that only men needed visible signs; for a woman,
to be alive was enough.
The first test, the first winnowing, before any training even, was to step through one of those
three rings. Which one did not matter, or perhaps the choice was a matter of fate. That step seemingly
took her through her life again and again, her future spread out before her, all of the possible futures
based on every decision she might make for the rest of her life. Death was possible in those, too;
some women could not face the future any more than others could face the past. All possible futures
were too many for a mind to retain, of course. They jumbled together and faded away for the most
part, but a woman gained a sense of things that would happen in her life, that must happen, that might
happen. Usually even that was hidden until the moment was on her. Not always, though. Moiraine had
been through those rings.
A spoonful of hope and a cup of despair, she thought.

“I do not like seeing you like this,” Lan said. From Mandarb’s back and his own height, he
looked down on her, disquiet creasing the corners of his eyes. For him that was near tears of
frustration from another man.
Aiel streamed by on both sides of their horses, and gai’shain with pack animals. Moiraine was
startled to realize that Kadere’s water wagons had already gone by; she had not realized she had been
staring at the plaza for so long.
“Like what?” she asked, turning her mare to join the throng. Rand and his escort were already
out of the city.
“Worried,” he said bluntly, no readable expression on that stone-carved face now. “Afraid. I’ve
never seen you afraid, not when we had Trollocs and Myrddraal swarming over us, not even when
you learned the Forsaken were loose and Sammael was sitting almost on top of us. Is the end
coming?”
She gave a start, and immediately wished she had not. He was looking straight ahead over his
stallion’s ears, but the man never missed anything. Sometimes she thought he could see a leaf fall
behind his back. “Do you mean Tarmon Gai’don? A redbird in Seleisin knows as well as I. The Light
send, not so long as any of the seals remain unbroken.” The pair she had were on one of Kadere’s
wagons, too, each packed by itself in a cask stuffed with wool. A different wagon than the redstone
doorframe; she had made sure of that.
“What else could I mean?” he asked slowly, still not looking at her, and making her wish she had
bitten her tongue. “You have become—impatient. I can remember when you could wait weeks for one
tiny scrap of information, one word, without twitching a finger, but now—” He did look at her then, a
blue-eyed gaze that would have intimidated most women. And most men as well. “The oath you gave
to the boy, Moiraine. Whatever under the Light possessed you?”
“He has been drawing further and further away from me, Lan, and I must be close to him. He
needs whatever guidance I can give, and I will do everything short of sharing his bed to see that he
gets it.” The rings had told her that that would be disaster. Not that she had ever considered it—the
very idea still shocked her!—but in the rings it was something she would or could have considered in
the future. It was a measure of her growing desperation, no doubt, and in the rings she had seen that it
would bring ruination on everything. She wished she could remember how—there were keys to Rand
al’Thor in anything she could learn about him—but only the simple fact of calamity remained in her
mind.
“Perhaps it will help your humility grow, if he tells you to fetch his slippers and light his pipe.”
She stared at him. Could that be a joke? If so, it was not amusing. She had never found that
humility served very well in any situation. Siuan claimed that growing up in the Sun Palace in
Cairhien had put arrogance deeply into Moiraine’s bones, where she could not even see it—
something she firmly denied—but for all that Siuan was a Tairen fisherman’s daughter, she could
match any queen stare for stare, and to her arrogance meant opposition to her own plans.
If Lan was attempting jokes, however feeble and wrongheaded, he was changing. For nearly
twenty years he had followed her, and saved her life more times than she cared to count, often at great
risk to his own. Always he had accounted his life a small thing, valuable only for her need of it; some
said he wooed death the way a bridegroom wooed his bride. She had never held his heart, and never
felt jealousy toward the women who seemed to throw themselves at his feet. He had long claimed that
he had no heart. But he had found one this past year, found it when a woman tied it on a string to hang
around her neck.
He denied her, of course. Not his love for Nynaeve al’Meara, once a Wisdom in the Two Rivers

and now an Accepted of the White Tower, but that he could ever have her. He had two things, he said,
a sword that would not break and a war that could not end; he would never gift a bride with those.
That, at least, Moiraine had taken care of, though he would not know how until it was done. If he did,
he would very probably try to change matters, stubborn fool man that he could be.
“This arid land seems to have withered your own humility, al’Lan Mandragoran. I shall have to
find some water to make it grow again.”
“My humility is honed to razor sharpness,” he told her dryly. “You never let it grow too dull.”
Wetting a white scarf from his leather water bottle, he handed her the sodden cloth. She tied it around
her temples without comment. The sun was beginning to rise above the mountains behind them, a
searing ball of molten gold.
The thick column snaked up the barren side of Chaendaer, its tail still in Rhuidean when its head
had crested the slope, then down onto rough, hilly flats dotted with rock spires and flat-topped buttes,
some streaked with red or ocher through the gray or brown. The air was so clear that Moiraine could
see for miles, even after they were down off Chaendaer. Great natural arches reared, and in every
direction jagged mountains clawed at the sky. Dry gullies and hollows split a land sparsely dotted
with low, thorny bushes and leafless spiny plants. The rare tree, gnarled and stunted, usually bore
spines or thorns as well. The sun made it an oven. A hard land that had shaped a hard people. But Lan
was not the only one changing, or being changed. She wished she could see what Rand would make of
the Aiel in the end. There was a long journey ahead for everyone.

CHAPTER
8

Over the Border

Clinging to her perch at the rear of the jouncing wagon, Nynaeve used one hand for herself and
one for her straw hat as she peered back at the furious dust storm dwindling behind them in the
distance. The broad brim shaded her face in the morning heat, but the breeze generated by the
wagon’s rumbling speed was enough to snatch it from her head despite the dark red scarf tied under
her chin. Low-hilled grassland with occasional thickets rolled by, the grass sere and thin in the latesummer heat; dust churned up by the wagon wheels obscured her vision somewhat, and made her
cough besides. The white clouds in the sky lied. There had been no rain since before they left
Tanchico, weeks earlier, and it had been some time since the wide road had borne the traffic of
wagons that once kept it hardpacked.
No one appeared riding out of that seemingly solid wall of brown, which was just as well. She
had lost her anger at brigands trying to stop them this close to escaping the madness of Tarabon, and
unless she was angry, she could not sense the True Source, much less channel. Even angry, she had
been surprised at being able to raise such a storm; once whipped up, full of her fury, it held a life of
its own. Elayne had been startled at the size of it, too, though thankfully she had not let on to Thom or
Juilin. But even if her strength was increasing—her teachers in the Tower had said that it would, and
certainly none of them was strong enough to best one of the Forsaken as she had—even with that, she
still had that limitation. Had any of the bandits appeared, Elayne would have had to deal with them
alone, and she did not want that. Her earlier anger was gone, but she was making fine for another
crop.
Awkwardly climbing up over the canvas lashed across the load of casks, she reached down to
one of the water barrels fastened along the sides of the wagon together with the chests of their
possessions and supplies. Immediately her hat was on the back of her head, held only by the scarf.
Her fingers could just touch the lid of the barrel, unless she released the rope that she was gripping
with her other hand, and the way the wagon was lurching along, that would probably send her off onto
her nose.
Juilin Sandar guided the lanky brown gelding he was riding—Skulker was the improbable name
he had put on the animal—close to the wagon, and reached over to hand her one of the leather water
bottles slung about his saddle. She drank gratefully, though not gracefully. Hanging there like a bunch
of grapes on a windblown vine, she spilled nearly as much water down the front of her good gray
dress as she did down her throat.
It was a suitable dress for a merchant, high-necked, finely woven and well-cut, but still plain.
The pin on her breast, a small circle of dark garnets in gold, was perhaps too much for a merchant,
but it had been a gift from the panarch of Tarabon, along with other jewelry, much richer, hidden in a

compartment beneath the wagon driver’s seat. She wore it to remind herself that even women who sat
on thrones sometimes needed to be taken by the scruff of the neck and shaken. She had a little more
sympathy for the Tower’s manipulations of kings and queens now that she had dealt with Amathera.
She suspected that Amathera had meant her gifts as a bribe to make them depart Tanchico. The
woman had been willing to buy a ship so that they would not remain an hour more than necessary, but
no one had been willing to sell. The few vessels remaining in Tanchico Harbor that were suitable for
more than coasting had been jammed with refugees. Besides, a ship was the obvious way, the fastest
way, to leave, and the Black Ajah might well be watching for her and Elayne, after what had
happened. They had been sent to hunt Aes Sedai who were Darkfriends, not to be ambushed by them.
Thus the wagon and the long trek across a land torn by civil war and anarchy. She was beginning to
wish she had not insisted on avoiding the ships. Not that she would ever admit it to the others.
When she tried to hand the water bottle back to Juilin, he waved it away. A tough man,
seemingly carved from some dark wood, he was not very comfortable on the back of a horse. He
looked ridiculous, to her; not because of his obvious ill ease in the saddle, but for the silly red
Taraboner hat that he had taken to wearing on his flat, black hair, a brimless, conical thing, tall and
flat-topped. It did not go well with his dark Tairen coat, tight to the waist, then flaring. She did not
think it would go well with anything. In her opinion, he looked as if he were wearing a cake on his
head.
It was clumsy scrambling the rest of the way forward with the leather bottle in one hand and her
hat flapping, and she did it muttering imprecations for the Tairen thief-catcher—Never thief-taker,
not him!—for Thom Merrilin—Puffed-up gleeman!—and for Elayne of House Trakand, DaughterHeir of Andor, who ought to be shaken by the scruff of the neck herself!
She meant to slide onto the wooden driver’s seat between Thom and Elayne, but the goldenhaired girl was pressed tightly against Thom, her own straw hat hanging on her back. She was
clutching the white-mustached old fool’s arm as if afraid of falling off. Tight-mouthed, Nynaeve had
to settle for Elayne’s other side. She was glad she had her hair in one proper braid again, wrist-thick
and hanging down to her waist; she could give it a tug instead of thumping Elayne’s ear for her. The
girl had used to seem reasonably sensible, but something seemed to have addled her wits in Tanchico.
“They aren’t following us anymore,” Nynaeve announced, pulling her hat back into place. “You
can slow this thing down now, Thom.” She could have shouted that from the back and not needed to
clamber over the casks, but the image of herself bouncing about and calling for them to slow had
stopped her. She did not like making a fool of herself, and liked even less others seeing her in a
foolish light. “Put your hat on,” she told Elayne. “That fair skin of yours will not appreciate this sun
for long.”
As she had half-expected, the girl ignored her friendly advice. “You drive so wonderfully,”
Elayne gushed as Thom drew back on the reins, pulling the four-horse team to a walk. “You were in
control every minute.”
The tall, wiry man glanced down at her, bushy white eyebrows twitching, but all he said was,
“We have more company ahead, child.” Well, maybe he was not such a fool.
Nynaeve looked, and saw the snowy-cloaked mounted column approaching them over the next
low rise, perhaps half a hundred men in burnished mail and shining conical helmets, escorting as
many heavily laden wagons. Children of the Light. She was suddenly very conscious of the leather
thong hanging around her neck beneath her dress, and the two rings dangling between her breasts.
Lan’s heavy gold signet ring, the ring of the Kings of lost Malkier, would mean nothing to the
Whitecloaks, but if they saw the Great Serpent ring . . .

Fool woman! They aren’t likely to, unless you decide to undress!
Hastily she ran an eye over her companions. Elayne could not stop being beautiful, and now that
she had let go of Thom and was retying the green scarf that held her hat, her manner looked more
suited to a throne room than a merchant’s wagon, but aside from being blue, her dress was no
different from Nynaeve’s. She wore no jewelry; she had called Amathera’s gifts “gaudy.” She would
pass; she had done so fifty times since Tanchico. Barely. Only, this was the first meeting with
Whitecloaks. Thom, in stout brown wool, could have been any of a thousand gnarled, white-haired
men who worked wagons. And Juilin was Juilin. He knew how to behave, though he looked as though
he wished he were sure footed on the ground, with his staff or the slotted sword-breaker he wore at
his belt, rather than on a horse.
Thom drew the team over to one side of the road and halted as several Whitecloaks broke away
from the head of the column. Nynaeve put on a welcoming smile. She hoped they had not decided that
they needed another wagon.
“The Light illumine you, Captain,” she said to the narrow-faced man who was obviously the
leader, the only one not carrying a steel-tipped lance. She had no idea what rank the two golden knots
signified on the breast of his cloak, right below the flaring sunburst they all wore, but in her
experience men would accept any flattery. “We are very glad to see you. Bandits tried to rob us a few
miles back, but a dust storm appeared like a miracle. We barely esc—”
“You are a merchant? Few merchants have come out of Tarabon in some time.” The man’s voice
was as harsh as his face, and that looked as though all joy had been boiled out of it before he left the
cradle. Suspicion filled his dark, deep-set eyes; Nynaeve did not doubt that was permanent, too.
“Bound to where, with what?”
“I carry dyes, Captain.” She worked to maintain her smile under that steady, unblinking stare; it
was a relief when he shifted it to the others briefly. Thom was making a good job of appearing bored,
just a wagon driver who would be paid stopped or moving, and if Juilin had not snatched off that
ridiculous hat as he once would have, at least he seemed no more than idly interested, a hired man
with nothing to hide. When the Whitecloak’s gaze dropped to Elayne, Nynaeve felt the other woman
stiffen, and hurried on. “Taraboner dyes. The finest in the world. I can get a good price for them in
Andor.”
At a signal from the captain—or whatever he was—one of the other Whitecloaks heeled his
horse to the back of the wagon. Slicing one of the ropes with his dagger, he jerked some of the canvas
loose, enough to expose three or four casks. “They’re branded ‘Tanchico,’ Lieutenant. This one says
‘crimson.’ Do you want me to break open a few?”
Nynaeve hoped the Whitecloak officer took the anxiety on her face the right way. Even without
looking at her, she could all but feel Elayne wanting to call the soldier down for his manners, but any
real merchant would be worried at having dyes exposed to the elements. “If you will show me the
ones you want opened, Captain, I will be more than happy to do it myself.” The man showed no
response at all, to flattery or offers of cooperation. “The casks were sealed to keep out dust and
water, you see. If the cask head is broken, I’ll never be able to cover it over with wax again here.”
The rest of the column reached them and began to pass in a cloud of dust; the wagon drivers
were roughly dressed, nondescript men, but the soldiers rode stiffly erect, their long steel lance points
all slanted at exactly the same angle. Even sweaty-faced and coated with dust, they looked hard men.
Only the drivers glanced at Nynaeve and the others.
The Whitecloak lieutenant waved dust away from his face with one gauntleted hand, then
motioned the man back from the wagon. His eyes never left Nynaeve. “You come from Tanchico?”

Nynaeve nodded, a picture of cooperation and openness. “Yes, Captain. Tanchico.”
“What word have you of the city? There have been rumors.”
“Rumors, Captain? When we left, there was little order remaining. The city was full of refugees,
and the countryside of rebels and bandits. Trade hardly exists.” That was the truth, pure and simple.
“That’s why these dyes will fetch particularly good prices. There will be no more Taraboner dyes
available for a long while, I think.”
“I do not care about refugees, trade or dyes, merchant,” the officer said in flat tones. “Was
Andric still on the throne?”
“Yes, Captain.” Obviously, rumor said someone had taken Tanchico and supplanted the King,
and perhaps someone had. But who—one of the rebel lords who fought each other as hard as they did
Andric, or the Dragonsworn who had pledged themselves to the Dragon Reborn without ever seeing
him? “Andric was still King, and Amathera still Panarch, when we left.”
His eyes said she could be lying. “It is said the Tar Valon witches were involved. Did you see
any Aes Sedai, or hear of them?”
“No, Captain,” she said quickly. The Great Serpent ring seemed hot against her skin. Fifty
Whitecloaks, close at hand. A dust storm would not help this time, and anyway, though she tried to
deny it, she was more scared than angry. “Plain merchants don’t mingle with that sort.” He nodded,
and she risked adding a question. Anything to change the subject. “If you please, Captain, have we
entered Amadicia yet?”
“The border is five miles east,” he pronounced. “For the time being. The first village you come
to will be Mardecin. Obey the law, and you will be well. There is a garrison of the Children there.”
He sounded as if the garrison would spend all of its time making sure they did obey the law.
“Have you come to move the border?” Elayne asked suddenly and coolly. Nynaeve could have
strangled her.
The deep-set, suspicious eyes shifted to Elayne, and Nynaeve said hastily, “Forgive her, my
Lord Captain. My eldest sister’s girl. She thinks she should have been born a lady, and she can’t keep
away from the boys besides. That’s why her mother sent her to me.” Elayne’s indignant gasp was
perfect. It was also probably quite real. Nynaeve supposed she had not needed to add that about boys,
but it seemed to fit.
The Whitecloak stared at them a moment longer, then said, “The Lord Captain Commander sends
food into Tarabon. Otherwise, we would have Taraboner vermin over the border and stealing
anything they could chew. Walk in the Light,” he added before swinging his horse to gallop back to
the head of the column. It was neither suggestion nor blessing.
Thom got the wagon moving as soon as the officer left, but everyone sat silent, except for
coughing, until they were well beyond the last soldier and out of the other wagons’ dust.
Swallowing a little water to wet her throat, Nynaeve pushed the water bottle at Elayne. “What
did you mean back there?” she demanded. “We aren’t in your mother’s throne room, and your mother
would not stand for it anyway!”
Elayne emptied the rest of the leather bottle before deigning to reply. “You were crawling,
Nynaeve.” She pitched her voice high, in a mock servility. “I am very good and obedient, Captain.
May I kiss your boots, Captain?”
“We are supposed to be merchants, not queens in disguise!”
“Merchants do not have to be lickspittles! You are lucky he didn’t think we were trying to hide
something, acting so servile!”
“They don’t stare down their noses at Whitecloaks with fifty lances, either! Or did you think we

could overwhelm them all with the Power, if need be?”
“Why did you tell him I could not keep away from boys? There was no need for that, Nynaeve!”
“I was ready to tell him anything that would make him go away and leave us alone! And you—!”
“Both of you shut up,” Thom barked suddenly, “before they come back to see which of you is
murdering the other!”
Nynaeve actually twisted around on the wooden seat to look back before she realized the
Whitecloaks were too far off to hear even if they had been shouting. Well, maybe they had been. It did
not help that Elayne did the same.
Nynaeve took a firm hold on her braid and glared at Thom, but Elayne snuggled herself against
his arm and practically cooed, “You are right, Thom. I am sorry I raised my voice.” Juilin was
watching them sideways, pretending not to, but he was wise enough not to bring his horse close
enough to become part of it.
Letting go of her braid before she pulled it out by the roots, Nynaeve adjusted her hat and sat
staring straight ahead over the horses. Whatever had gotten into the girl, it was high time to get it out
again.
Only a tall stone pillar to each side of the road marked the border between Tarabon and
Amadicia. There was no traffic on the road but them. The hills gradually became a little higher, but
otherwise the land remained much the same, brown grass and thickets with few green leaves except
on pine or leatherleaf or other evergreens. Stone-fenced fields and thatch-roofed stone farmhouses
dotted the slopes and dells, but they had a look of abandonment. No smoke rising from chimneys, no
men working crops, no sheep or cows. Sometimes a few chickens scratched in a farmyard near the
road, but they scurried away, gone feral, at the wagon’s approach. Whitecloak garrison or no,
apparently no one was willing to risk Taraboner brigands this close to the border.
When Mardecin appeared, from the top of a rise, the sun still had a long way to climb to its
zenith. The town ahead looked too big for the name of village, nearly a mile across, straddling a small
bridged stream between two hills, with as many slate roofs as thatched, and considerable bustle in the
wide streets.
“We need to buy supplies,” Nynaeve said, “but we want to be quick about it. We can cover a lot
of ground yet before nightfall.”
“We are wearing out, Nynaeve,” Thom said. “First light to last light every day for nearly a
month. One day resting will not make much difference in reaching Tar Valon.” He did not sound tired.
More likely he was looking forward to playing his harp or his flute in one of the taverns and getting
men to buy him wine.
Juilin had finally brought his mount close to the wagon, and he added, “I could do with a day on
my feet. I do not know whether this saddle or that wagon seat is worse.”
“I think we should find an inn,” Elayne said, looking up at Thom. “I have had quite enough of
sleeping under this wagon, and I would like to listen to you tell stories in the common room.”
“One-wagon merchants are little more than peddlers,” Nynaeve said sharply. “They cannot
afford inns in a town like this.”
She did not know whether that was true or not, but despite her own desire for a bath and clean
sheets, she was not going to let the girl get away with directing the suggestion at Thom. It was not
until the words were out of her mouth that she realized that she had given in to Thom and Juilin. One
day won’t hurt. It’s a long way to Tar Valon yet.
She wished she had insisted on a ship. With a fast ship, a Sea Folk raker, they could have gotten
to Tear in a third of what it had taken them to cross Tarabon, as long as they had good winds, and

with the right Atha’an Miere Windfinder that would have been no problem; she or Elayne could have
handled it, for that matter. The Tairens knew that she and Elayne were friends of Rand’s, and she
expected that they still sweated buckets for fear of offending the Dragon Reborn; they would have
provided a carriage and escort for the journey up to Tar Valon.
“Find us a place to camp,” she said reluctantly. She should have insisted on a ship. They might
have been back in the Tower by now.

CHAPTER
9

A Signal

Nynaeve had to admit that Thom and Juilin between them had chosen a good campsite, in a
sparse thicket growing on an eastern slope, covered with dead leaves, a scant mile from Mardecin.
Scattered sourgums and some sort of small, droopy-branched willow screened the wagon from the
road and the town, and a two-foot-wide rivulet ran from a stone outcrop near the top of the rise, down
a bed of dried mud twice as broad. Enough water for their purposes. It was even a little cooler under
the trees, with a small and welcome breeze.
Once the two men had watered the team and hobbled them where the horses could feed on the
sparse grass upslope, they tossed a coin to decide which should take the lanky gelding into Mardecin
to purchase what they needed. The coin flipping was a ritual that they had developed. Thom, whose
nimble fingers were used to performing sleight-of-hand, never lost when he flipped the coin, so Juilin
always did it now.
Thom won anyway, and while he was stripping the saddle from Skulker, Nynaeve put her head
under the wagon seat and levered up a floorboard with her belt knife. Besides two small gilded
coffers containing Amathera’s presents of jewelry, several leather purses bulging with coin lay in the
recess. The panarch had been more than generous in her desire to see their backs. The other things
looked trifling by comparison; a small dark wooden box, polished but plain and uncarved, and a
washleather purse lying flat and showing the impression of a disc inside. The box held the two
ter’angreal they had recovered from the Black Ajah, both linked to dreams, and the purse . . . That
was their prize from Tanchico. One of the seals on the Dark One’s prison.
As much as she wanted to find out where Siuan Sanche wanted them to chase the Black Ajah
next, the seal was the source of her haste to reach Tar Valon. Digging coins from one of the fat purses,
she avoided touching the flat purse; the longer it remained in her possession, the more she wanted to
hand it to the Amyrlin and be done with it. Sometimes she thought she could feel the Dark One, trying
to break through, when she was near the thing.
She saw Thom off with a pocketful of silver and a strong admonition to search out some fruit and
green vegetables; either man was likely as not to buy nothing but meat and beans, left to himself.
Thom’s limp as he led the horse off toward the road made her grimace; an old injury, and nothing to
be done for it now, so Moiraine said. That rankled as much as the limp itself. Nothing to be done.
When she had left the Two Rivers, it had been to protect young people from her village,
snatched away in the night by an Aes Sedai. She had gone to the Tower still with the hope that she
could somehow shelter them, and the added ambition of bringing down Moiraine for what she had
done. The world had changed since then. Or maybe she only saw the world differently. No, it is not
me that’s changed. I’m the same; it is everything else that’s different.

Now it was all she could do to protect herself. Rand was what he was, and no turning back, and
Egwene eagerly went her own way, not letting anyone or anything hold her back even if her way led
over a cliff, and Mat had learned to think of nothing but women, carousing and gambling. She even
found herself sympathizing with Moiraine sometimes, to her disgust. At least Perrin had gone back
home, or so she had heard through Egwene, secondhand from Rand; perhaps Perrin was safe.
Hunting the Black Ajah was good and right and satisfying—and also terrifying, though she tried
to hide that part; she was a grown woman, not a girl who needed to hide in her mother’s apron—yet
that was not the main reason she was willing to keep on bashing her head against a wall, keep on
trying to learn to use the Power when most of the time she could not channel any more than Thom.
That reason was the Talent called Healing. As Wisdom of Emond’s Field it had been gratifying to
bring the Women’s Circle around to her way of thinking—especially since most were old enough to
be her mother; with not many years on Elayne, she had been the youngest Wisdom ever in the Two
Rivers—and even more so to see that the Village Council did what they should, stubborn men that
they were. The most satisfaction, though, had always come from finding the right combination of herbs
to cure an illness. To Heal with the One Power . . . She had done it, fumbling, curing what her other
skills never could. The joy of it was enough to bring tears. One day she meant to Heal Thom and
watch him dance. One day she would even Heal that wound in Rand’s side. Surely there was nothing
that could not be Healed, not if the woman wielding the Power was determined enough.
When she turned from watching Thom go, she found that Elayne had filled the bucket that
normally hung beneath the wagon and was kneeling to wash her hands and face, a towel around her
shoulders to keep her dress dry. That was something she particularly wanted to do herself. In this heat
it was pleasant sometimes to wash in water cool from a stream. Often enough there had been no water
but what was in the barrels strapped to the wagon, and that was needed for drinking and cooking more
than washing.
Juilin was sitting with his back against one of the wagon wheels, his thumb-thick staff of pale
ridged wood leaning next to him. His head was down, that silly hat tipped precariously over his eyes,
but she was not willing to bet on even a man sleeping at this time of the morning. There were things
he and Thom did not know, things it was best they did not know.
The thick carpet of dead sourgum leaves crackled as she seated herself near Elayne. “Do you
think Tanchico really has fallen?” Rubbing a soapy cloth slowly across her face, the other woman did
not reply. She tried again. “I think that Whitecloak’s ‘Aes Sedai’ were us.”
“Perhaps.” Elayne’s voice was cool, a pronouncement from the throne. Her eyes were blue ice.
She did not look at Nynaeve. “And perhaps reports of what we did got tangled with other rumors.
Tarabon could have a new king, and a new panarch, very easily.”
Nynaeve kept her temper in check and her hands away from her braid. They clutched her knees
instead. You are trying to put her at ease with you. Watch your tongue. “Amathera was difficult, but
I do not wish her any harm. Do you?”
“A pretty woman,” Juilin said, “especially in one of those Taraboner serving girl’s dresses, with
a pretty smile. I thought she—” He saw Elayne and her looking at him and quickly pulled his hat back
down, pretending to sleep again. She and Elayne shared a glance, and she knew the other’s thought
was the same as hers. Men.
“Whatever has happened to Amathera, Nynaeve, she is behind us, now.” Elayne sounded more
normal. Her washcloth slowed. “I wish her well, but mainly I hope the Black Ajah is not behind us.
Not following, I mean.”
Juilin stirred uneasily without raising his head; he was still uncomfortable with the knowledge

that Black Aes Sedai were real and not simply a tale in the streets.
He should be happy he doesn’t have our knowledge. Nynaeve had to admit that the thought was
not entirely logical, but if he had known about the Forsaken being loose, even Rand’s foolish
instruction to look after her and Elayne would not have kept him from running. Still, he was useful at
times. He and Thom both. It had been Moiraine who had fastened Thom to them, and the man knew a
great deal about the world for an ordinary gleeman.
“If they were following, they’d have caught up by now.” That was surely true, considering the
usual lumbering speed of the wagon. “With any luck, they still do not know who we are.”
Elayne nodded, grim but her old self again, and began rinsing her face. She could be almost as
determined as a Two Rivers woman. “Liandrin and most of her cronies surely escaped from
Tanchico. Maybe all of them. And we still don’t know who is giving orders for the Black Ajah in the
Tower. As Rand would say, we still have it to do, Nynaeve.”
Despite herself, Nynaeve winced. True, they had a list of eleven names, but once they were back
in the Tower, almost any Aes Sedai they spoke to might be Black Ajah. Or any women they
encountered on the road. For that matter, anyone they met might be a Darkfriend, but that was hardly
the same thing, not by a wide degree.
“More than the Black Ajah,” Elayne continued, “I worry about Mo—” Nynaeve put a quick hand
on her arm and nodded slightly toward Juilin. Elayne coughed and went on as though that was what
had stopped her. “About Mother. She has no reason to like you, Nynaeve. Quite the opposite.”
“She is far away from here.” Nynaeve was glad her voice was steady. They were not talking
about Elayne’s mother, but the Forsaken she had defeated. Part of her hoped fervently that Moghedien
was far away. Very far.
“But if she was not?”
“She is,” Nynaeve said firmly, but she still hitched her shoulders uncomfortably. A part of her
remembered humiliations suffered at Moghedien’s hands and desired nothing more than to face the
woman again, to defeat her again, for good this time. Only, what if Moghedien took her by surprise,
came at her when she was not angry enough to channel? The same was true of any of the Forsaken, of
course, or of any Black sister for that matter, but after her rout in Tanchico, Moghedien had reason to
hate her personally. Not pleasant at all to think that one of the Forsaken knew your name and likely
wanted your head. That is just rank cowardice, she told herself sharply. You are not a coward, and
you will not be! That did not stop the itch between her shoulder blades every time Moghedien came
to mind, as if the woman was staring at her back.
“I suppose looking over my shoulder for bandits has made me nervous,” Elayne said casually,
patting her face with the towel. “Why, sometimes when I dream of late, I have the feeling that
someone is watching me.”
Nynaeve gave a start at what seemed an echo of her own thoughts, but then she realized there had
been a slight emphasis on “dream.” Not any dreams, but Tel’aran’rhiod. Another thing the men did
not know about. She had had the same sensation, but then there was often a feel of unseen eyes in the
World of Dreams. It could be uncomfortable, but they had discussed the sensation before.
She made her voice light. “Well, your mother is not in our dreams, Elayne, or she would
probably snatch us both up by an ear.” Moghedien would probably torture them until they begged for
death. Or arrange a circle of thirteen Black sisters and thirteen Myrddraal; they could turn you to the
Shadow against your will that way, bind you to the Dark One. Maybe Moghedien could even do it by
herself. . . . Don’t be ridiculous, woman! If she could have, she would have. You beat her,
remember?

“I do hope not,” the other woman replied soberly.
“Do you mean to give me a chance to wash?” Nynaeve asked irritably. Putting the girl at ease
was all very well, but she could do with less talk of Moghedien. The Forsaken had to be somewhere
distant; she would not have let them come this far peacefully if she knew where they were. Light send
that that’s true!
Elayne emptied and refilled the bucket herself. She was a very nice girl usually, when she
remembered that she was not in the Royal Palace in Caemlyn. And when she was not acting the fool.
That, Nynaeve would take care of when Thom came back.
Once Nynaeve had enjoyed a slow, cooling wash of face and hands, she set about making the
camp ready, and put Juilin to breaking dead branches from the trees for a fire. By the time Thom
returned with two wicker hampers slung across the gelding’s back, her and Elayne’s blankets were
laid out under the wagon and the two men’s under the hanging branches of one of the twenty-foot
willows, a good supply of firewood had been stacked, the teakettle stood cooling beside the ashes of
a fire in a circle cleared of leaves, and the thick pottery cups had been washed. Juilin was grumbling
to himself as he caught water in the tiny stream to refill the water barrels. From the snatches Nynaeve
heard, she was glad he kept most of it to an inaudible mutter. From her perch on one of the wagon
shafts, Elayne hardly tried to hide her interested attempt to make out what he was saying. Both she and
Nynaeve had put on clean dresses on the other side of the wagon, switching colors as it happened.
After fastening hobbles between the gelding’s forelegs, Thom lifted the heavy hampers down
easily and began unpacking them. “Mardecin’s not as prosperous as it looks from a distance.” He set
a net bag of small apples on the ground, and another of some dark green leafy vegetable. “With no
trade into Tarabon, the town is withering.” The rest seemed to be all sacks of dried beans and turnips,
plus pepper-cured beef and salt-cured hams. And a gray pottery bottle sealed with wax that Nynaeve
was sure held brandy; both men had complained of not having a bit of something with their pipes of
an evening. “You can hardly take six steps without seeing a Whitecloak or two. The garrison is about
fifty men or so, with barracks over the hill from the town on the far side of the bridge. It was
considerably larger, but it seems Pedron Niall is pulling Whitecloaks from everywhere into
Amador.” Knuckling his long mustaches, he looked thoughtful for a moment. “I cannot see what he is
up to.” Thom was not a man who liked that; usually a few hours in a place was enough for him to
begin ferreting out the currents between noble and merchant Houses, the alliances and schemes and
counterplots that made up the so-called Game of Houses. “The rumors are all about Niall trying to
stop a war between Illian and Altara, or maybe Illian and Murandy. No reason there for him to be
gathering in soldiers. I’ll tell you one thing, though. Whatever that lieutenant said, it is a King’s Tax
that buys the food being sent into Tarabon, and the people are not happy with it. Not to feed
Taraboners.”
“King Ailron and the Lord Captain Commander are not our concern,” Nynaeve said, studying
what he had brought. Three salted hams! “We will pass through Amadicia as quickly and
unobtrusively as we can. Perhaps Elayne and I will have more luck finding vegetables than you did.
Would you care for a walk, Elayne?”
Elayne got up immediately, smoothing her gray skirts and lifting her hat from the wagon. “That
would be very nice, after that wagon seat. It might be different if Thom and Juilin let me take a turn
riding Skulker more often.” For once she did not give the old gleeman a coquettish look, which was
something.
Thom and Juilin exchanged glances, and the Tairen thief-catcher pulled a coin from his coat
pocket, but Nynaeve gave him no chance to flip it. “We will be quite all right by ourselves. We could

hardly expect trouble of any sort with so many Whitecloaks to keep order.” Planting her hat on her
head, she tied the scarf under her chin and gave them a firm look. “Besides, all those things Thom
bought need to be put away.” Both men nodded; slowly, reluctantly, but they did it. Sometimes they
took their roles as supposed protectors entirely too seriously.
She and Elayne had reached the empty road and were walking down the verge, on the thin grass
so as not to kick up dust, before she had it settled in her mind how to bring up what she wanted to say.
Before she could speak, though, Elayne said, “You obviously want to talk to me alone, Nynaeve. Is it
about Moghedien?”
Nynaeve blinked, and looked at the other woman sideways. It was well to remember that Elayne
was no fool. She had only been acting like one. Nynaeve resolved to keep a tight hold on her temper;
this was going to be difficult enough without letting it dissolve into a shouting match. “Not that,
Elayne.” The girl thought they should add Moghedien to their hunt; she could not seem to realize the
difference between one of the Forsaken and, say, Liandrin, or Chesmal. “I thought we should discuss
how you’ve been behaving toward Thom.”
“I do not know what you mean,” Elayne said, staring straight ahead toward the town, but sudden
spots of color in her cheeks gave her the lie.
“Not only is he old enough to be your father twice over, but—”
“He is not my father!” Elayne snapped. “My father was Taringail Damodred, a Prince of
Cairhien and First Prince of the Sword of Andor!” Straightening her hat needlessly, she went on in a
milder tone, though not by much. “I am sorry, Nynaeve. I did not mean to shout.”
Temper, Nynaeve reminded herself. “I thought you were in love with Rand,” she said, making
her voice gentle. It was not easy. “The messages you have me give to Egwene for him certainly say
so. I expect you tell her the same.”
The color in the other woman’s face heightened. “I do love him, but . . . He is very far away,
Nynaeve. In the Waste, surrounded by a thousand Maidens of the Spear who jump to do his bidding. I
cannot see him, or speak to him, or touch him.” She was whispering by the end.
“You can’t think he’ll turn to a Maiden,” Nynaeve said incredulously. “He is a man, but he isn’t
as fickle as that, and besides, one of them would put a spear in him if he looked at her crossways,
even if he is this Dawn whatever. Anyway, Egwene says Aviendha is keeping an eye on him for you.”
“I know, but . . . I should have made sure that he knew I love him.” Elayne’s voice was
determined. And worried. “I should have told him so.”
Nynaeve had hardly looked at a man before Lan, at least not seriously, but she had seen and
learned much as Wisdom; from her observations, there was no quicker way to send a man running for
his life, unless he said it first.
“I think Min had a viewing,” Elayne went on. “About me, and about Rand. She always used to
joke about having to share him, but I think it wasn’t a joke and she could not bring herself to say what
it really was.”
“That is ridiculous.” It certainly was. Though in Tear, Aviendha had told her of a vile Aiel
custom. . . . You share Lan with Moiraine, a small voice whispered. That isn’t the same thing at all!
she told it briskly. “Are you certain Min had one of her visions?”
“Yes. I wasn’t at first, but the more I think on it, the more sure I become. She joked about it too
often to mean anything else.”
Well, whatever Min had seen, Rand was no Aiel. Oh, his blood might be Aiel as the Wise Ones
claimed, but he had grown up in the Two Rivers, and she would not stand by and let him take up
wicked Aiel ways. She doubted very much that Elayne would, either. “Is that why you’ve been—”

She would not say throwing yourself at “—teasing Thom?”
Elayne gave her a sidelong glance, the crimson back in her cheeks. “There are a thousand
leagues between us, Nynaeve. Do you think Rand is refraining from looking at other women? ‘A man
is a man, on a throne or in a pigsty.’ ” She had a stock of homely sayings from her childhood nurse, a
clearheaded woman named Lini whom Nynaeve wished she would meet one day.
“Well, I don’t see why you have to flirt just because you think Rand might.” She refrained from
bringing up Thom’s age again. Lan is old enough to be your father, that small voice murmured. I love
Lan. If I can only reason out how to get him free of Moiraine. . . . That is not the matter at hand!
“Thom is a man with secrets, Elayne. Remember that Moiraine sent him with us. Whatever he is, he is
no simple country gleeman.”
“He was a great man,” Elayne said softly. “He could have been greater, except for love.”
With that, Nynaeve’s temper snapped. She rounded on the other woman, seizing her by the
shoulders. “The man doesn’t know whether to turn you over his knee or . . . or . . . climb a tree!”
“I know.” Elayne gave a frustrated sigh. “But I do not know what else to do.”
Nynaeve ground her teeth in the effort not to shake her until her skull rattled. “If your mother
heard of this, she’d send Lini to haul you back to the nursery!”
“I am not a child any longer, Nynaeve.” Elayne’s voice was strained, and now the flush in her
cheeks was not embarrassment. “I am as much a woman as my mother is.”
Nynaeve stalked on toward Mardecin, gripping her braid so hard that her knuckles hurt.
After a few strides, Elayne caught up. “Are we really going to buy vegetables?” Her face was
composed, her tone light.
“Did you see what Thom brought back?” Nynaeve said tightly.
Elayne shuddered elaborately. “Three hams. And that awful peppered beef! Do men ever eat
anything but meat if it isn’t set before them?”
Nynaeve’s temper faded as they walked on talking about the foibles of the weaker sex—men, of
course—and such simple matters as that. Not completely away, of course. She liked Elayne, and
enjoyed her company; at times it seemed as if the girl really was Egwene’s sister, as they sometimes
called each other. When Elayne was not acting the twitchskirt. Thom could put a stop to it, of course,
but the old fool indulged Elayne like a fond father with his favorite daughter, even when he did not
know whether to say boo or faint. One way or another, she meant to get to the bottom of it. Not for
Rand’s sake, but because Elayne was better than this. It was as if she had contracted a strange fever.
Nynaeve intended to cure it.
Granite slabs paved the streets of Mardecin, worn by generations of feet and wagon wheels, and
the buildings were all brick or stone. A number of them were empty though, both shops and houses,
sometimes with the front door standing open so Nynaeve could see the bare interior. She saw three
blacksmith’s shops, two abandoned, and in the third the smith was halfheartedly rubbing his tools
with oil and the forges were cold. One slate-roofed inn, with men sitting morosely on benches out
front, had a number of broken windows, and at another the adjoining stable had its doors half-off the
hinges and a dusty coach squatting in the stableyard, one forlorn hen nesting on the driver’s high seat.
Somebody in that one was playing the bittern; “Heron on the Wing,” it sounded like, but the tune was
dispirited. The door of a third inn was barred by two splintery planks nailed across it.
People thronged the streets, but they moved lethargically, weighted down by the heat; dull faces
said they had no real reason to stir at all, beyond habit. Many women, in large deep bonnets that
almost hid their faces, had on dresses worn at the hem, and more than one man had a frayed collar or
cuffs on his knee-length coat.

There were indeed Whitecloaks scattered through the streets; if not so many as Thom had made
out, still enough. Nynaeve’s breath caught every time she saw a man in a pristine cloak and shining
armor look at her. She knew she had not worked with the Power nearly long enough to take on Aes
Sedai agelessness, but those men might well try to kill her—a Tar Valon witch, and outlawed in
Amadicia—if they even suspected a connection to the White Tower. They strode through the crowds,
seemingly oblivious of the apparent poverty around them. People moved out of their way respectfully,
receiving perhaps a nod, if that, and often a sternly pious “Walk in the Light.”
Ignoring the Children of the Light as best she could, she set herself to finding fresh vegetables,
but by the time the sun reached its peak, a blazing ball of gold that burned through the thin clouds, she
and Elayne had wandered both sides of the low bridge and between them had managed to garner one
small bunch of honeypeas, some tiny radishes, a few hard pears, and a basket to carry them in.
Perhaps Thom really had looked. This time of year, the barrows and stalls should have been full of
the summer’s produce, but most of what they saw was heaped potatoes and turnips that had known
better days. Thinking of all those empty farms approaching the town, Nynaeve wondered how these
people were going to make it through the winter. She walked on.
Hanging upside down beside the door of a thatch-roofed seamstress’s shop was a bunch of what
looked almost like broomweed, with tiny yellow flowers, the stalks wrapped their whole length in a
white ribbon, then tied with a dangling yellow one. It might have been some woman’s feeble attempt
at a festive decoration in the midst of hard times. But she was sure it was not.
Stopping beside an empty shop with a carving knife incised on the sign still hanging over the
door, she pretended to search for a stone in her shoe while furtively studying the seamstress’s shop.
The door was open, and colorful bolts of cloth stood in the small-paned windows, but no one went in
or out.
“Can you not find it, Nynaeve? Take off your shoe.”
Nynaeve’s head jerked; she had almost forgotten that Elayne was there. No one else was paying
any attention to them, and no one looked close enough to overhear. She still lowered her voice. “That
bunch of broomweed by that shop door. It is a Yellow Ajah signal, an emergency signal from one of
the Yellow’s eyes-and-ears.”
She did not have to tell Elayne not to stare; the girl’s eyes barely moved toward the shop. “Are
you certain?” she asked quietly. “And how do you know?”
“Of course I am certain. It’s exact; the hanging bit of yellow ribbon is even split in three.” She
paused to take a deep breath. Unless she was completely mistaken, that insignificant fistful of weeds
held a dire meaning. If she was wrong, she was making a fool of herself, and she did hate to do that.
“I spent a good deal of time talking with Yellows in the Tower.” Healing was the main purpose of the
Yellows; they did not care much for her herbs, but you did not need herbs when you could Heal with
the Power. “One of them told me. She did not think it too great a transgression, since she was sure I’ll
choose Yellow. Besides, it has not been used in nearly three hundred years. Elayne, only a few
women in each Ajah actually know who the Ajah’s eyes-and-ears are, but a bunch of yellow flowers
tied and hung like that tells any Yellow sister that here one is, and with a message urgent enough to
risk uncovering herself.”
“How are we going to find out what it is?”
Nynaeve liked that. Not “What are we going to do?” The girl had backbone.
“Follow my lead,” she said, gripping the basket tighter as she straightened. She hoped she
remembered everything Shemerin had told her. She hoped Shemerin had told her everything. The
plump Yellow could be fluttery for an Aes Sedai.

The interior of the shop was not large, and every scrap of wall was taken up by shelves holding
bolts of silk or finely woven wool, spools of piping and binding, and ribbon and lace of every width
and description. Dressmaker’s dummies stood about the floor wearing garments ranging from halfmade to complete, from something suitable for a dance in embroidered green wool to a pearly gray
silk gown that could have done very well at court. At first glance the shop had a look of prosperity
and activity, but Nynaeve’s sharp eye caught a hint of dust in one high neck of frothy Solinde lace, and
on a large black velvet bow at the waist of another gown.
There were two dark-haired women in the shop. One, young and thin and trying to wipe her nose
surreptitiously with the back of her hand, held a bolt of pale red silk clutched anxiously to her bosom.
Her hair was a mass of long curls to her shoulders, in the Amadician fashion, but it seemed a tangle
beside the other woman’s neat array. The other, handsome and in her middle years, was assuredly the
seamstress, as proclaimed by the large bristling pincushion fastened to her wrist. Her dress was of a
good green wool, well cut and well made to show her skill, but only lightly worked with white
flowers around the high neck so as not to overshadow her patrons.
When Nynaeve and Elayne walked in, both women gaped as if none had entered in a year. The
seamstress recovered first, regarding them with careful dignity as she made a slight curtsy. “May I
serve you? I am Ronde Macura. My shop is yours.”
“I want a dress embroidered with yellow roses on the bodice,” Nynaeve told her. “But no
thorns, mind,” she added with a laugh. “I don’t heal very fast.” What she said did not matter, so long
as she included “yellow” and “heal” in it. Now, if only that bunch of flowers was not happenstance. If
that was the case, she would have to find some reason not to buy a dress with roses. And a way to
keep Elayne from recounting the whole miserable experience to Thom and Juilin.
Mistress Macura stared at her for a moment with dark eyes, then turned to the thin girl, pushing
her toward the back of the shop. “Go on to the kitchen, Luci, and make a pot of tea for these good
ladies. From the blue canister. The water’s hot, thank the Light. Go on, girl. Put that down and stop
gawking. Quickly, quickly. The blue canister, mind. My best tea,” she said, turning back to Nynaeve
as the girl vanished through a door at the rear. “I live over the shop, you see, and my kitchen is in the
back.” She was smoothing her skirts nervously, thumb and forefinger of her right hand forming a
circle. For the Great Serpent ring. There would be no need for an excuse about the dress, it seemed.
Nynaeve repeated the sign, and after a moment Elayne did, too. “I am Nynaeve, and this is
Elayne. We saw your signal.”
The woman fluttered as if she might fly away. “The signal? Ah. Yes. Of course.”
“Well?” Nynaeve said. “What is the urgent message?”
“We should not talk about that out here . . . uh . . . Mistress Nynaeve. Anyone might walk in.”
Nynaeve doubted that. “I will tell you over a nice cup of tea. My best tea, did I say?”
Nynaeve exchanged looks with Elayne. If Mistress Macura was this reluctant to speak her news,
it must be appalling indeed.
“If we may just step into the back,” Elayne said, “no one will hear but us.” Her regal tone made
the seamstress stare. For a moment, Nynaeve thought it might cut through her nervousness, but the next
instant the fool woman was babbling again.
“The tea will be ready in a moment. The water’s already hot. We used to get Taraboner tea
through here. That is why I am here, I suppose. Not the tea, of course. All the trade that used to be,
and all the news that came both ways with the wagons. They—you are mainly interested in outbreaks
of disease, or a new kind of illness, but I find that interesting myself. I dabble a little with—” She
coughed and rushed on; if she smoothed her dress any harder, she would wear a hole in it. “Some

about the Children, of course, but they—you—are not much interested in them, really.”
“The kitchen, Mistress Macura,” Nynaeve said firmly as soon as the other woman paused for
breath. If the woman’s news made her this afraid, Nynaeve would brook no more delay in hearing it.
The door at the back opened enough to admit Luci’s anxious head. “It’s ready, Mistress,” she
announced breathlessly.
“This way, Mistress Nynaeve,” the seamstress said, still rubbing the front of her dress.
“Mistress Elayne.”
A short hallway led past narrow stairs to a snug, beam-ceilinged kitchen, with a steaming kettle
sitting on the hearth and tall cupboards everywhere. Copper pots hung between the back door and a
window that looked out into a small yard with a high wooden fence. The small table in the middle of
the floor held a brilliant yellow teapot, a green honey jar, three mismatched cups in as many colors,
and a squat blue pottery canister with the lid beside it. Mistress Macura snatched the canister, lidded
it, and hastily put it into a cupboard that held more in two dozen shades and hues.
“Sit, please,” she said, filling the cups. “Please.”
Nynaeve took a ladder-back chair next to Elayne, and the seamstress set cups in front of them,
flitting to one of the cupboards for pewter spoons.
“The message?” Nynaeve said as the woman sat down across from them. Mistress Macura was
too nervous to touch her own teacup, so Nynaeve stirred a little honey into hers and took a sip; it was
hot, but had a cool, minty aftertaste. Hot tea might settle the woman’s nerves, if she could be made to
drink.
“A pleasant taste,” Elayne murmured over the edge of her cup. “What sort of tea is it?”
Good girl, Nynaeve thought.
But the seamstress’s hands only fluttered beside her cup. “A Taraboner tea. From near the
Shadow Coast.”
Sighing, Nynaeve took another swallow to settle her own stomach. “The message,” she said
insistently. “You did not hang that signal to invite us for tea. What is your urgent news?”
“Ah. Yes.” Mistress Macura licked her lips, eyed them both, then said slowly, “It came near a
month ago, with orders that any sister passing through heard it at all costs.” She wet her lips again.
“All sisters are welcome to return to the White Tower. The Tower must be whole and strong.”
Nynaeve waited for the rest, but the other woman fell silent. This was the dire message? She
looked at Elayne, but the heat seemed to be catching up to the girl; drooping in her chair, she was
staring at her hands on the table. “Is that all of it?” Nynaeve demanded, and surprised herself by
yawning. The heat must be reaching her, too.
The seamstress only watched her, intently.
“I said,” Nynaeve began, but suddenly her head felt too heavy for her neck. Elayne had slumped
onto the table, she realized, eyes closed and arms hanging limply. Nynaeve stared at the cup in her
hands with horror. “What did you give us?” she said thickly; that minty taste was still there, but her
tongue felt swollen. “Tell me!” Letting the cup fall, she levered herself up against the table, knees
wobbling. “The Light burn you, what?”
Mistress Macura scraped back her chair and stepped out of reach, but her earlier nervousness
was now a look of quiet satisfaction.
Blackness rolled in on Nynaeve; the last thing she heard was the seamstress’s voice. “Catch her,
Luci!”

CHAPTER
10

Figs and Mice

Elayne realized that she was being carried upstairs by her shoulders and ankles. Her eyes
opened, she could see, but the rest of her body might as well have belonged to someone else for all
the control she had over it. Even blinking was slow. Her brain felt crammed full of feathers.
“She’s awake, Mistress!” Luci shrilled, nearly dropping her feet. “She’s looking at me!”
“I told you not to worry.” Mistress Macura’s voice came from above her head. “She cannot
channel, or twitch a muscle, not with forkroot tea in her. I discovered that by accident, but it has
certainly come in handy.”
It was true. Elayne sagged between them like a doll with half the stuffing gone, bumping her
bottom along the steps, and she could as well have run as channel. She could sense the True Source,
but trying to embrace it was like trying to pick up a needle on a mirror with cold-numbed fingers.
Panic welled up, and a tear slid down her cheek.
Perhaps these women meant to turn her over to the Whitecloaks for execution, but she could not
make herself believe that the Whitecloaks had women setting traps in the hope that an Aes Sedai
might wander in. That left Darkfriends, and almost certainly serving the Black Ajah right along with
the Yellow. She would surely be put in the hands of the Black Ajah unless Nynaeve had escaped. But
if she was to escape, she could not count on anyone else. And she could neither move nor channel.
Suddenly she realized that she was trying to scream, and producing only a thin, gurgling mewl.
Halting it took all the strength she had left.
Nynaeve knew all about herbs, or claimed she did; why had she not recognized whatever that tea
was? Stop this whining! The small, firm voice in the back of her head sounded remarkably like Lini.
A shoat squealing under a fence just attracts the fox, when it should be trying to run. Desperately,
she set herself to the simple task of embracing saidar. It had been a simple task, but now she might as
well have been attempting to reach saidin. She kept on, though; it was the only thing she could do.
Mistress Macura, at least, seemed to have no worry. As soon as they had dropped Elayne onto a
narrow bed in a small, close room with one window, she hustled Luci right out again with not even a
backward glance. Elayne’s head had fallen so she could see another cramped bed, and a highchest
with tarnished brass pulls on the drawers. She could move her eyes, but shifting her head was beyond
her.
In a few minutes the two women returned, puffing, with Nynaeve slung between them, and
heaved her onto the other bed. Her face was slack, and glistening with tears, but her dark eyes . . .
Fury filled them, and fear, too, Elayne hoped anger was uppermost; Nynaeve was stronger than she,
when she could channel; perhaps Nynaeve could manage where she was failing miserably, time after
time. Those had to be tears of rage.

Telling the thin girl to stay there, Mistress Macura hurried out once more, this time coming back
with a tray that she placed atop the highchest. It held the yellow teapot, one cup, a funnel and a tall
hourglass. “Now Luci, mind you pour a good two ounces into each of them as soon as that hourglass
empties. As soon, mind!”
“Why don’t we give it to them now, Mistress?” the girl moaned, wringing her hands. “I want
them to go back to sleep. I don’t like them looking at me.”
“They would sleep like the dead, girl, and this way we can let them rouse just enough to walk
when we need them to. I will dose them more properly when it’s time to send them off. They’ll have
headaches and stomach cramps to pay for it, but no more than they deserve, I suppose.”
“But what if they can channel, Mistress? What if they do? They’re looking at me.”
“Stop blathering, girl,” the older woman said briskly. “If they could, don’t you think they would
have by now? They are helpless as kittens in a sack. And they will stay that way as long you keep a
good dose in them. Now, you do as I told you, understand? I must go tell old Avi to send off one of
his pigeons, and make a few arrangements, but I will be back as soon as I can. You had better brew
another pot of forkroot just in case. I’ll go out the back. Close up the shop. Someone might wander in,
and that would never do.”
After Mistress Macura left, Luci stood staring at them for a while, still wringing her hands, then
finally scurried out herself. Her sniffling faded down the stairs.
Elayne could see sweat beading on Nynaeve’s brow; she hoped it was effort, not the heat. Try,
Nynaeve. She herself reached for the True Source, fumbling clumsily through the wads of wool that
seemed to pack her head, failed, tried again and failed, tried again. . . . Oh, Light, try, Nynaeve! Try!
The hourglass filled her eyes; she could not look at anything else. Sand pouring down, each grain
marking another failure on her part. The last grain dropped. And Luci did not come.
Elayne strained harder, for the Source, to move. After a bit the fingers of her left hand twitched.
Yes! A few minutes more, and she could lift her hand; only a feeble inch before it fell again, but it had
lifted. With an effort, she could turn her head.
“Fight it,” Nynaeve mumbled thickly, barely intelligible. Her hands were gripping the coverlet
under her tightly; she seemed to be trying to sit up. Not even her head lifted, but she was trying.
“I am,” Elayne tried to say; it sounded more like a grunt to her ears.
Slowly she managed to raise her hand to where she could see it, and hold it there. A thrill of
triumph shot through her. Stay afraid of us, Luci. Stay down there in the kitchen a little while
longer, and . . .
The door banged open, and sobs of frustration racked her as Luci dashed in. She had been so
close. The girl took one look at them and with a yelp of pure terror darted for the highchest.
Elayne tried to fight her, but thin as she was, Luci batted her floundering hands away effortlessly,
forced the funnel between her teeth just as easily. The girl panted as if running. Cold, bitter tea filled
Elayne’s mouth. She stared up at the girl in a panic that Luci’s face shared. But Luci held Elayne’s
mouth shut and stroked her throat with a grim if fearful determination until she swallowed. As
darkness overwhelmed Elayne, she could hear liquid sounds of protest coming from Nynaeve.
When her eyes opened again, Luci was gone, and the sands trickled through the glass again.
Nynaeve’s dark eyes were bulging, whether in fear or anger, Elayne could not have said. No,
Nynaeve would not give in. That was one of the things she admired in the other woman. Nynaeve’s
head could have been on the chopping block and she would not give up. Our heads are on the block!
It made her ashamed that she was so much weaker than Nynaeve. She was supposed to be Queen
of Andor one day, and she wanted to howl with terror. She did not, even in her head—doggedly she

went back to trying to force her limbs to move, to trying to touch saidar—but she wanted to. How
could she ever be a queen, when she was so weak? Again she reached for the Source. Again. Again.
Racing the grains of sand. Again.
Once more the glass emptied itself without Luci. Ever so slowly, she reached the point where
she could raise her hand again. And then her head! Even if it did flop back immediately. She could
hear Nynaeve muttering to herself, and she could actually understand most of the words.
The door crashed open once more. Elayne lifted her head to stare at it despairingly—and gaped.
Thom Merrilin stood there like the hero of one of his own tales, one hand firmly gripping the neck of
a Luci near fainting, the other holding a knife ready to throw. Elayne laughed delightedly, though it
came out more like a croak.
Roughly, he shoved the girl into a corner. “You stay there, or I’ll strop this blade on your hide!”
In two steps he was at Elayne’s side, smoothing her hair back, worry painting his leathery face.
“What did you give them, girl? Tell me, or—!”
“Not her,” Nynaeve muttered. “Other one. Went away. Help me up. Have to walk.”
Thom left her reluctantly, Elayne thought. He showed Luci his knife again threateningly—she
cowered as if she never meant to move again—then made it disappear up his sleeve in a twinkling.
Hauling Nynaeve to her feet, he began walking her up and down the few paces the room allowed. She
sagged against him limply, shuffling.
“I am glad to hear this frightened little cat didn’t trap you,” he said. “If she had been the one . . .”
He shook his head. No doubt he would think just as little of them if Nynaeve told him the truth; Elayne
certainly did not intend to. “I found her rushing up the stairs, so panicked she did not even hear me
behind her. I am not so glad that another one got away without Juilin seeing her. Is she likely to bring
others back?”
Elayne rolled over onto her side. “I do not think so, Thom,” she mumbled. “She can’t let—too
many people—know about herself.” In another minute she might be able to sit up. She was looking
right at Luci; the girl flinched and tried to shrink through the wall. “The Whitecloaks—would take her
as—quickly as they would us.”
“Juilin?” Nynaeve said. Her head wavered as she glared up at the gleeman. She had no trouble
speaking, though. “I told the pair of you to stay with the wagon.”
Thom blew out his mustaches irritably. “You told us to put up the supplies, which did not take
two men. Juilin followed you, and when none of you came back, I went looking for him.” He snorted
again. “For all he knew, there were a dozen men in here, but he was ready to come in after you alone.
He is tying Skulker in the back. A good thing I decided to ride in. I think we’ll need the horse to get
you two out of here.”
Elayne found that she could sit up, barely, pulling herself hand over hand along the coverlet, but
an effort to stand nearly put her flat again. Saidar was as unobtainable as ever; her head still felt like
a goose-down pillow. Nynaeve was beginning to hold herself a little straighter, to lift her feet, but she
still hung on Thom.
Minutes later Juilin arrived, pushing Mistress Macura ahead of him with his belt knife. “She
came through a gate in the back fence. Thought I was a thief. It seemed best to bring her on in.”
The seamstress’s face had gone so pale at the sight of them that her eyes seemed darker, and
about to come out of her head besides. She licked her lips and smoothed her skirt incessantly, and
cast quick little glances at Juilin’s knife as if wondering whether it might not be best to run anyway.
For the most part, though, she stared at Elayne and Nynaeve; Elayne thought it an even chance whether
she would burst into tears or swoon.

“Put her over there,” Nynaeve said, nodding to where Luci still shivered in the corner with her
arms wrapped around her knees, “and help Elayne. I never heard of forkroot, but walking seems to
help the effects pass. You can walk most things off.”
Juilin pointed to the corner with his knife, and Mistress Macura scurried to it and sat herself
down beside Luci, still wetting her lips fearfully. “I—would not have done—what I did—only, I had
orders. You must understand that. I had orders.”
Gently helping Elayne to her feet, Juilin supported her in walking the few steps available,
crisscrossing the other pair. She wished it were Thom. Juilin’s arm around her waist was much too
familiar.
“Orders from whom?” Nynaeve barked. “Who do you report to in the Tower?”
The seamstress looked sick, but she clamped her mouth shut determinedly.
“If you don’t talk,” Nynaeve told her, scowling, “I’ll let Juilin have you. He’s a Tairen thiefcatcher, and he knows how to bring out a confession as quickly as any Whitecloak Questioner. Don’t
you, Juilin?”
“Some rope to tie her,” he said, grinning a grin so villainous that Elayne almost tried to step
away from him, “some rags to gag her until she is ready to talk, some cooking oil and salt. . . .” His
chuckle curdled Elayne’s blood. “She will talk.” Mistress Macura held herself rigidly against the
wall, staring at him, eyes as wide as they would go. Luci looked at him as if he had just turned into a
Trolloc, eight feet tall and complete with horns.
“Very well,” Nynaeve said after a moment. “You should find everything you need in the kitchen,
Juilin.” Elayne shifted a startled look from her to the thief-catcher and back. Surely they did not really
mean to . . . ? Not Nynaeve!
“Narenwin Barda,” the seamstress gasped suddenly. Words tripped over one another spilling out
of her. “I send my reports to Narenwin Barda, at an inn in Tar Valon called The Upriver Run. Avi
Shendar keeps pigeons for me on the edge of town. He doesn’t know who I send messages to or who I
get them from, and he does not care. His wife had the falling sickness, and . . .” She trailed off,
shuddering and watching Juilin.
Elayne knew Narenwin, or at least had seen her in the Tower. A thin little woman you could
forget was there, she was so quiet. And kind, too; one day a week, she let children bring their pets to
the Tower grounds for her to Heal. Hardly the sort of woman to be Black Ajah. On the other hand,
one of the Black Ajah names they knew was Marillin Gemalphin; she liked cats, and went out of her
way to look after strays.
“Narenwin Barda,” Nynaeve said grimly. “I want more names, inside the Tower or out.”
“I—don’t have any more,” Mistress Macura said faintly.
“We will see about that. How long have you been a Darkfriend? How long have you served the
Black Ajah?”
An indignant squall erupted from Luci. “We aren’t Darkfriends!” She glanced at Mistress
Macura and sidled away from her. “At least, I’m not! I walk in the Light! I do!”
The other woman’s reaction was no less strong. If her eyes had bulged before, they popped now.
“The Black—! You mean it really exists? But the Tower has always denied—Why, I asked
Narenwin, the day she chose me for the Yellow’s eyes-and-ears, and it was the next morning before I
could stop weeping and crawl out of my bed. I am not—not!—a Darkfriend! Never! I serve the
Yellow Ajah! The Yellow!”
Still hanging on to Juilin’s arm, Elayne exchanged puzzled looks with Nynaeve. Any Darkfriend
would deny it, of course, but there seemed a ring of truth in the women’s voices. Their outrage at the

accusation was nearly enough to overcome their fear. From the way Nynaeve hesitated, she heard the
same thing.
“If you serve the Yellow,” she said slowly, “why did you drug us?”
“It was her,” the seamstress replied, nodding at Elayne. “I was sent her description a month
since, right down to that way she holds her chin sometimes so she seems to be looking down at you.
Narenwin said she might use the name Elayne, and even claim to be of a noble House.” Word by
word, her anger over being called a Darkfriend seemed to bubble higher. “Maybe you are a Yellow
sister, but she’s no Aes Sedai, just a runaway Accepted. Narenwin said I was to report her presence,
and that of anyone with her. And to delay her, if I could. Or even capture her. And anyone with her.
How they expected me to capture an Accepted, I do not know—I don’t think even Narenwin knows
about my forkroot tea!—but that is what my orders said! They said I should risk exposure even—here,
where it’d be my death!—if I had to! You just wait until the Amyrlin puts her hands on you, young
woman! On all of you!”
“The Amyrlin!” Elayne exclaimed. “What does she have to do with this?”
“It was on her orders. By order of the Amyrlin Seat, it said. It said the Amyrlin herself said I
could use any means short of killing you. You will wish you were dead when the Amyrlin gets hold of
you!” Her sharp nod was full of furious satisfaction.
“Remember that we are not in anyone’s hands yet,” Nynaeve said dryly. “You are in ours.” Her
eyes looked as shocked as Elayne felt, though. “Was any reason given?”
The reminder that she was the captive sapped the brief burst of spirit from the woman. She
sagged listlessly against Luci, each keeping the other from falling over. “No. Sometimes Narenwin
gives a reason, but not this time.”
“Did you intend to just keep us here, drugged, until someone came for us?”
“I was going to send you off by cart, dressed in some old clothes.” Not even a shred of
resistance remained in the woman’s voice. “I sent a pigeon to tell Narenwin you were here, and what
I was doing. Therin Lugay owes me a strong favor, and I meant to give him enough forkroot to last all
the way to Tar Valon, if Narenwin didn’t send sisters to meet you sooner. He thinks you are ill, and
the tea is the only thing keeping you alive until an Aes Sedai can Heal you. A woman has to be
careful, dealing in remedies in Amadicia. Cure too many, or too well, somebody whispers Aes Sedai,
and the next you know your house is burning down. Or worse. Therin knows to hold his tongue about
what he . . .”
Nynaeve made Thom help her closer, where she could stare down at the seamstress. “And the
message? The real message? You did not put that signal out in the hope of luring us in.”
“I gave you the real message,” the woman said wearily. “I did not think it could do any harm. I
don’t understand it, and I—please—” Suddenly she was sobbing, clinging to Luci as hard as the
younger woman did to her, both of them wailing and babbling. “Please, don’t let him use the salt on
me! Please! Not the salt! Oh, please!”
“Tie them up,” Nynaeve said disgustedly after a moment, “and we will go downstairs where we
can talk.” Thom helped her to sit on the edge of the nearest bed, then quickly cut strips from the other
coverlet.
In short order both women were bound, back to back, the hands of one to the feet of the other,
with wadded bits of coverlet tied in for gags. The pair were still weeping when Thom assisted
Nynaeve from the room.
Elayne wished she could walk as well as the other woman, but she still needed Juilin’s support
not to go tumbling down the stairs. She felt a small stab of jealousy watching Thom with his arm

around Nynaeve. You are a foolish little girl, Lini’s voice said sharply. I am a grown woman, she
told it with a firmness she would not have dared with her old nurse even today. I do love Rand, but
he is far away, and Thom is sophisticated and intelligent and . . . It sounded too much like excuses,
even to her. Lini would have given the snort that meant she was about to stop tolerating foolishness.
“Juilin,” she asked hesitantly, “what were you going to do with the salt and cooking oil? Not
exactly,” she added more quickly. “Just a general idea.”
He looked at her for a moment. “I do not know. But they did not, either. That is the trick of it;
their minds made up worse than I ever could. I have seen a tough man break when I sent for a basket
of figs and some mice. You have to be careful, though. Some will confess anything, true or not, just to
escape what they imagine. I do not think those two did, though.”
She did not either. She could not repress a shiver, however. What would somebody do with figs
and mice? She hoped she stopped wondering before she gave herself nightmares.
By the time they reached the kitchen, Nynaeve was tottering about without help, poking into the
cupboard full of colorful canisters. Elayne needed one of the chairs. The blue canister sat on the
table, and a full green teapot, but she tried not to look at them. She still could not channel. She could
embrace saidar, yet it slipped away as soon as she did. At least she was confident now that the
Power would return to her. The alternative was too horrible to contemplate, and she had not let
herself until this moment.
“Thom,” Nynaeve said, lifting the lids on various containers and peering in. “Juilin.” She
paused, took a deep breath, and, still not looking at the two men, said, “Thank you. I begin to see why
Aes Sedai have Warders. Thank you very much.”
Not all Aes Sedai did. Reds considered all men tainted because of what men who could channel
did, and a few never bothered because they did not leave the Tower or simply did not replace a
Warder who died. The Greens were the only Ajah to allow bonding with more than one Warder.
Elayne wanted to be a Green. Not for that reason, of course, but because the Greens called
themselves the Battle Ajah. Where Browns searched for lost knowledge and Blues involved
themselves in causes, Green sisters held themselves ready for the Last Battle, when they would go
forth, as they had in the Trolloc Wars, to face new Dreadlords.
The two men stared at one another in open amazement. They had surely been ready for the usual
rough side of Nynaeve’s tongue. Elayne was almost as shocked. Nynaeve liked having to be helped as
much as she liked being wrong; either made her as prickly as a briar, though of course she always
claimed to be a picture of sweet reason and sense.
“A Wisdom.” Nynaeve took a pinch of powder from one of the canisters and sniffed it, touched
it to the tip of her tongue. “Or whatever they call it here.”
“They don’t have a name for it here,” Thom said. “Not many women follow your old craft in
Amadicia. Too dangerous. For most of those it’s only a sideline.”
Pulling a leather scrip from the bottom of the cupboard, Nynaeve began making up small bundles
from some of the containers. “And who do they go to when they’re ill? A hedge-doctor?”
“Yes,” Elayne said. It always pleased her to show Thom that she knew things about the world,
too. “In Amadicia, it is men who study herbs.”
Nynaeve frowned scornfully. “What could a man ever know about curing anything? I’d as soon
ask a farrier to make a dress.”
Abruptly Elayne realized that she had been thinking of anything and everything except what
Mistress Macura had said. Not thinking about a thorn doesn’t make it hurt your foot less. One of
Lini’s favorites. “Nynaeve, what do you think that message means? All sisters are welcome to return

to the Tower? It makes no sense.” That was not what she wanted to say, but at least she was closing
in on it.
“The Tower has its own rules,” Thom said. “What Aes Sedai do, they do for reasons of their
own, and often not for those they give. If they give reasons at all.” He and Juilin knew they were only
Accepted, of course; that was at least part of why neither man did as he was told nearly as well as he
might.
The struggle was plain on Nynaeve’s face. She did not like being interrupted, or people
answering for her. There was quite a list of things Nynaeve did not like. But it was only a moment
since she had thanked Thom; it could not be easy to call down a man who had just saved you from
being hauled off like a cabbage. “Very little in the Tower makes sense most of the time,” she said
sourly. Elayne suspected that the tartness was as much for Thom as the Tower.
“Do you believe what she said?” Elayne took a deep breath. “About the Amyrlin saying I was to
be brought back by any means.”
The brief look Nynaeve gave her was touched with sympathy. “I don’t know, Elayne.”
“She was telling the truth.” Juilin turned one of the chairs around and straddled it, leaning his
staff against the back. “I’ve questioned enough thieves and murderers to know truth when I hear it.
Part of the time she was too frightened to lie, and the rest too angry.”
“The pair of you—” Taking a deep breath, Nynaeve tossed the scrip onto the table and folded
her arms as if to trap her hands away from her braid. “I am afraid Juilin is probably right, Elayne.”
“But the Amyrlin knows what we are doing. She sent us out of the Tower in the first place.”
Nynaeve sniffed loudly. “I can believe anything of Siuan Sanche. I would like to have her for
one hour where she could not channel. We would see how tough she is then.”
Elayne did not think that would make any difference. Remembering that commanding blue gaze,
she suspected Nynaeve would earn a fine lot of bruises in the unlikely event that she ever got her
wish. “But what are we going to do about it? The Ajahs have eyes-and-ears everywhere, it seems.
And the Amyrlin herself. We could have women trying to slip things into our food all the way to Tar
Valon.”
“Not if we do not look like what they expect.” Lifting a yellow jug out of the cupboard, Nynaeve
set it on the table beside the teapot. “This is white henpepper. It will soothe a toothache, but it will
also turn your hair black as night.” Elayne put a hand to her red-gold tresses—her hair, not
Nynaeve’s, she would wager!—but as much as she hated the idea, it was a good one. “A little needlework on some of those dresses in the front, and we are not merchants anymore, but two ladies
traveling with their servants.”
“Riding on a wagonload of dye?” Juilin said.
Her level look said gratitude for saving her extended only so far. “There is a coach in a
stableyard on the other side of the bridge. I think the owner will sell it. If you go back to the wagon
before somebody steals it—I do not know what got into you two, just leaving it for whoever came
along!—if it is still there, you can take one of the purses. . . .”
A few people goggled when Noy Torvald’s coach pulled up in front of Ronde Macura’s shop,
drawn by a team of four, with chests strapped to the roof and a saddled horse tied on behind. Noy had
lost everything when the trade with Tarabon collapsed; he was scraping a living doing odd jobs for
Widow Teran, now. No one in the street had ever seen the coachman before, a tall leathery fellow
with long white mustaches and cold, imperious eyes, or the dark, hard-faced footman in a Taraboner
hat who jumped down nimbly to open the coach door. The goggling turned to murmurs when two

women swept out of the shop with bundles in their arms; one wore a green silk gown, the other plain
blue wool, but each had a scarf wrapped around her head so that not so much as a hint of her hair was
visible. They all but leaped into the coach.
Two of the Children began sauntering over to inquire who the strangers were, but while the
footman was still scrambling up to the driver’s seat, the coachman cracked his long whip, shouting
something about making way for a lady. Her name was lost as the Children threw themselves out of
the way, tumbling in the dusty street, and the coach rumbled away at a gallop toward the Amador
Road.
The onlookers walked away talking among themselves; a mysterious lady, obviously, with her
maid, making purchases from Ronde Macura and rushing away from the Children. Little enough
happened in Mardecin of late, and this would provide days of conversation. The Children of the Light
brushed themselves off furiously, but finally decided that reporting the incident would make them look
foolish. Besides, their captain did not like nobles; he would probably send them to bring the coach
back, a long ride in the heat for no more than an arrogant young sprig of one House or another. If no
charges could be brought—always tricky with the nobility—it would not be the captain who took the
blame. Hoping that word of their humiliation did not spread, they certainly never thought of
questioning Ronde Macura.
A short time later, Therin Lugay led his cart into the yard behind the shop, provisions for the
long journey ahead already packed away under the round canvas top. Indeed, Ronde Macura had
cured him of a fever that had taken twenty-three the winter before, but it was a nagging wife and a
shrewish mother-in-law that made him glad of a journey all the way to where the witches lived.
Ronde had said someone might meet him, though not who, but he hoped to make it to Tar Valon.
He tapped on the kitchen door six times before going in, but it was not until he climbed the stairs
that he found anyone. In the back bedroom, Ronde and Luci lay stretched out on the beds, sound
asleep and fully clothed, if rather rumpled, with the sun still in the sky. Neither woman roused when
he shook them. He did not understand that, or why one of the coverlets was lying on the floor cut into
knotted strips, or why there were two empty teapots in the room but only one cup, or why a funnel
was lying on Ronde’s pillow. But he had always known that there was a great deal in the world he
did not understand. Returning to his cart, he thought about the supplies Ronde’s money had purchased,
thought of his wife and her mother, and when he led the cart horse off, it was with the intention of
seeing what Altara was like, or maybe Murandy.
One way and another, it was quite a time before a disheveled Ronde Macura tottered up to Avi
Shendar’s house and sent off a pigeon, a thin bone tube tied to its leg. The bird launched itself north
and east, straight as an arrow toward Tar Valon. After a moment’s thought, Ronde prepared another
copy on another narrow strip of thin parchment, and fastened it to a bird from another coop. That one
headed west for she had promised to send duplicates of all of her messages. In these hard times, a
woman had to make out as best she could, and there could be no harm in it, not the sort of reports she
made to Narenwin. Wondering if she could ever get the taste of forkroot out of her mouth, she would
not have minded if the report brought just a little harm to the one who called herself Nynaeve.
Hoeing in his garden patch as usual, Avi paid no attention to what Ronde did. And as usual, as
soon as she was gone, he washed his hands and went inside. She had placed a larger sheet of
parchment underneath the strips to cushion the nib of the pen. When he held it up to the afternoon light,
he could make out what she had written. Soon a third pigeon was on its way, heading in still another
direction.

CHAPTER
11

The Nine Horse Hitch

A wide straw hat shaded Siuan’s face as she let Logain lead the way through Lugard’s Shilene
Gate under the late-afternoon sun. The city’s tall gray outer walls were in some disrepair; in two
places she could see, tumbled stone lowered the wall to no more than a tall fence. Min and Leane
rode close behind her, both tired from the pace the man had set over the weeks since Kore Springs.
He wanted to be in charge, and it took little enough to convince him that he was. If he said when they
started of a morning, when and where they stopped of a night, if he kept the money, even if he
expected them to serve his meals as well as cook them, it was of little account to her. All in all, she
felt sorry for him. He had no idea what she planned for him. A big fish on the hook to catch a bigger,
she thought grimly.
In name, Lugard was the capital of Murandy, the seat of King Roedran, but lords in Murandy
spoke the words of fealty, then refused to pay their taxes, or do much of anything else that Roedran
wanted, and the people did the same. Murandy was a nation in name only, the people barely held
together by supposed allegiance to the king or queen—the throne changed hands at sometimes short
intervals—and fear that Andor or Illian might snap them up if they did not hold together in some
fashion.
Stone walls crisscrossed the city, most in a worse state than the outer bastions, for Lugard had
grown haphazardly over the centuries, and more than once had actually been divided among feuding
nobles. It was a dirty city, many of the broad streets unpaved and all of them dusty. Men in highcrowned hats and aproned women in skirts that showed their ankles dodged between merchants’
lumbering trains, while children played in wagon ruts. Trade kept Lugard alive, trade up from Illian
and Ebou Dar, from Ghealdan to the west and Andor to the north. Large bare patches of ground
through the city held wagons parked wheel-to-wheel, many heavy-laden under strapped-down canvas
covers, others empty and awaiting freight. Inns lined the main streets, along with horse lots and
stables, nearly outnumbering the gray stone houses or shops, all roofed with tiles in blue or red or
purple or green. Dust and noise filled the air, clanging from the smithies, the rumble of wagons and
curses of the drivers, boisterous laughter from the inns. The sun baked Lugard as it slid toward the
horizon, and the air felt as though it might never rain again.
When Logain finally turned in to a stableyard and dismounted behind a green-roofed inn called
The Nine Horse Hitch, Siuan clambered down from Bela gratefully and gave the shaggy mare a
doubtful pat on the nose, wary of teeth. In her view, sitting on the back of an animal was no way to
travel. A boat went as you turned the rudder; a horse might decide to think for itself. Boats never bit,
either; Bela had not so far, but she could. At least those awful first days of stiffness were gone, when
she was sure Leane and Min were grinning behind her back as she hobbled about in the evening camp.

After a day in the saddle, she still felt as if she had been thoroughly beaten, but she managed to hide
it.
As soon as Logain began bargaining with the stableman, a lanky, freckled old fellow in a leather
vest and no shirt, Siuan sidled close to Leane. “If you want to practice your wiles,” she said softly,
“practice them on Dalyn the next hour.” Leane gave her a dubious look—she had dabbled in smiles
and glances at some of the villages since Kore Springs, but Logain had gotten no more than a flat look
—then sighed and nodded. Taking a deep breath, she glided forward in that startling sinuous way,
leading her arch-necked gray and already smiling at Logain. Siuan could not see how she did that; it
was as if some of her bones were no longer rigid.
Moving over to Min, she spoke just as quietly again. “The instant Dalyn is done with the
stableman, tell him you are going to join me inside. Then hurry ahead, and stay away from him and
Amaena until I come back.” From the noise roaring out of the inn, the crowd inside was big enough to
hide an army. Surely big enough to hide the absence of one woman. Min got that mulish look about her
eyes and opened her mouth, no doubt to demand why. Siuan forestalled her. “Just do it, Serenla. Or
I’ll let you add cleaning his boots to handing him his plate.” The stubborn look remained, but Min
gave a sullen nod.
Pushing Bela’s reins into the other woman’s hands, Siuan hurried out of the stableyard and
started down the street in what she hoped was the right direction. She did not want to have to search
the entire city, not in this heat and dust.
Heavy wagons behind teams of six or eight or even ten filled the streets, drivers cracking long
whips and cursing equally at the horses and at the people who darted between the wagons. Roughly
dressed men mingling through the crowds in long wagon drivers’ coats sometimes directed laughing
invitations at women who passed them. The women who wore colorful aprons, sometimes striped,
their heads wrapped in bright scarves, walked on with eyes straight ahead, as though they did not
hear. Women without aprons, hair hanging loose around their shoulders and skirts sometimes ending a
foot or more clear of the ground, often shouted back even ruder replies.
Siuan gave a start when she realized that some of the men’s suggestions were aimed at her. They
did not make her angry—she really could not apply them to herself in her own mind—only startled.
She was still not used to the changes in herself. That men might find her attractive. . . . Her reflection
in the filthy window of a tailor’s shop caught her eye, not much more than a murky image of a fairskinned girl under a straw hat. She was young; not just young-appearing, as far as she could tell, but
young. Not much older than Min. A girl in truth, from the vantage of the years she had actually lived.
An advantage to having been stilled, she told herself. She had met women who would pay any
price to lose fifteen or twenty years; some might even consider her price a fair bargain. She often
found herself listing such advantages, perhaps trying to convince herself they were real. Freed from
the Three Oaths, she could lie at need, for one thing. And her own father would not have recognized
her. She did not really look as she had as a young woman; the changes maturity had made were still
there, but softened into youth. Coldly objective, she thought she might be somewhat prettier than she
had been as a girl; pretty was the best that had ever been said of her. Handsome had been the more
usual compliment. She could not connect that face to her, to Siuan Sanche. Only inside was she still
the same; her mind yet held all its knowledge. There, in her head, she was still herself.
Some of the inns and taverns in Lugard had names like The Farrier’s Hammer, or The Dancing
Bear, or The Silver Pig, often with garish signs painted to match. Others had names that should not
have been allowed, the mildest of that sort being The Domani Wench’s Kiss, with a painting of a
coppery-skinned woman—bare to the waist!—with her lips puckered. Siuan wondered what Leane

would make of that, but the way the woman was now, it might only give her notions.
At last, on a side street just as wide as the main, just beyond a gateless opening in one of the
collapsing inner walls, she found the inn she wanted, three stories of rough gray stone topped with
purple roof tiles. The sign over the door had an improbably voluptuous woman wearing only her hair,
arranged to hide as little as possible, astride a barebacked horse, and a name that she skipped over as
soon as she recognized it.
Inside, the common room was blue with pipesmoke, packed with raucous men drinking and
laughing, trying to pinch serving maids, who dodged as best they could with long-suffering smiles.
Barely audible over the babble, a zither and a flute accompanied a young woman singing and dancing
on a table at one end of the long room. Occasionally the singer swirled her skirts high enough to show
nearly the whole length of her bare legs; what Siuan could catch of her song made her want to wash
out the girl’s mouth. Why would a woman go walking with no clothes on? Why would a woman sing
about it to a lot of drunken louts? It was not a sort of place she had ever been into before. She
intended to make this visit as brief as possible.
There was no mistaking the inn’s owner, a tall, heavyset woman encased in a red silk dress that
practically glowed; elaborate, dyed curls—nature had never produced that shade of red, surely never
with such dark eyes—framed a thrusting chin and a hard mouth. In between shouting orders to the
serving girls, she stopped at this table or that to speak a few words or slap a back and laugh with her
patrons.
Siuan held herself stiffly and tried to ignore the considering looks men gave her as she
approached the crimson-haired woman. “Mistress Tharne?” She had to repeat the name three times,
each louder than the last, before the inn’s owner looked at her. “Mistress Tharne, I want a job singing.
I can sing—”
“You can, can you now?” The big woman laughed. “Well, I have a singer, but I can always use
another to give her a rest. Let me be seeing your legs.”
“I can sing ‘The Song of the Three Fishes,’ ” Siuan said loudly. This had to be the right woman.
Surely two women in one city could not have hair like that, not and answer to the right name at the
right inn.
Mistress Tharne laughed harder still and slapped one of the men at the nearest table on the
shoulder, jolting him half off his bench. “Not much call for that one here, eh, Pel?” Gap-toothed Pel, a
wagon driver’s whip curled around his shoulder, cackled with her.
“And I can sing ‘Blue Sky Dawning.’ ”
The woman shook, scrubbing at her eyes as though she had laughed herself to tears. “Can you,
now? Ah, I’m sure the lads will love that. Now let me see your legs. Your legs, girl, or get out!”
Siuan hesitated, but Mistress Tharne only stared at her. And an increasing number of the men
did, too. This had to be the right woman. Slowly, she pulled her skirt up to her knees. The tall woman
gestured impatiently. Closing her eyes, Siuan gathered more and more of her skirt in her hands. She
felt her face growing redder by the inch.
“A modest one,” Mistress Tharne chortled. “Well, if those songs are the extent of your
knowledge, you’d better have legs to make a man fall on his face. Can’t tell till we get those woolen
stockings off her, eh, Pel? Well, come on with me. Maybe you have a voice, anyway, but I can’t hear
it in here. Come on, girl! Hustle your rump!”
Siuan’s eyes snapped open, blazing, but the big woman was already striding toward the back of
the common room. Backbone like an iron rod, Siuan let her skirts fall and followed, trying to ignore
the guffaws and lewd suggestions directed at her. Her face was stone, but inside, worry warred with

anger.
Before being raised to the Amyrlin Seat, she had run the Blue Ajah’s network of eyes-and-ears;
some had also been her own personal listeners both then and later. She might no longer be Amyrlin,
or even Aes Sedai, but she still knew all of those agents. Duranda Tharne had already been serving
the Blue when she took over the network, a woman whose information was always timely. Eyes-andears were not to be found everywhere, and their reliability varied—there had been only one that she
trusted enough to approach between Tar Valon and here, at Four Kings, in Andor, and she had
vanished—but a vast amount of news and rumor passed through Lugard with the merchants’ wagon
trains. There might be eyes-and-ears for other Ajahs here; it would be well to remember that. Caution
gets the boat home, she reminded herself.
This woman fit the description of Duranda Tharne perfectly, and surely no other inn could have a
name so vile, but why had she responded as she did when Siuan identified herself as another agent of
the Blue? She had to risk it; Min and Leane, in their own fashion, were growing as impatient as
Logain. Caution got the boat home, but sometimes boldness brought back a full hold. At the worst, she
could knock the woman over the head with something and escape out the back. Eyeing the woman’s
width and height, and the firmness of her thick arms, she hoped that she could.
A plain door in the corridor that led to the kitchens opened into a sparsely furnished room, a
desk and one chair on a scrap of blue carpet, a large mirror on one wall, and surprisingly, a short
shelf with a few books. As soon as the door was shut behind them, diminishing if not cutting off the
noise of the common room, the big woman rounded on Siuan, fists planted on ample hips. “Now, then.
What do you want with me? Don’t bother giving me a name; I don’t want to know, whether it’s yours
or not.”
A little of the tension oozed out of Siuan. Not the anger, though. “You had no right to treat me in
that manner out there! What did you mean forcing me to—!”
“I had every right,” Mistress Tharne snapped, “and every necessity. If you’d come at opening or
closing, as you’re supposed to, I could have hustled you in here and none the wiser. Do you think
some of those men wouldn’t be wondering if I escorted you back here like a long-lost friend? I can’t
afford to have anyone wondering about me. You’re lucky I didn’t make you take Susu’s place on the
table for a song or two. And you watch your manner with me.” She raised a wide, hard hand
threateningly. “I’ve married daughters older than you, and when I visit them, they step right and talk
proper. You come Mistress Snip with me, and you’ll be learning why. Nobody out there will even
hear you yelp, and if they did, they wouldn’t interfere.” With a sharp nod, as if that were settled, she
put fists on hips again. “Now, what do you want?”
Several times during the onslaught Siuan had tried to speak, but the woman rolled over her like a
tidal wave. That was not something she was accustomed to. By the time Mistress Tharne was done,
she quivered with anger; both hands held her skirts in a white-knuckled grip. She held on to her
temper every bit as hard. I am supposed to be just another agent, she reminded herself firmly. Not
the Amyrlin anymore, just another agent. Besides, she suspected that the woman might carry out her
threat. This was something else still new to her, having to be wary of someone under her eye just
because they were larger and stronger.
“I was given a message to deliver to a gathering of those we serve.” She hoped Mistress Tharne
took the strain in her voice for being cowed; the woman might be more helpful if she thought Siuan
properly intimidated. “They were not where I was told to find them. I can only hope you know
something to help me find them.”
Folding her arms under a massive bosom, Mistress Tharne studied her. “Know how to hold your

temper when it suits, eh? Good. What’s happened in the Tower? And don’t try denying you come from
there, my fine haughty wench. Your message has courtier writ large all over it, and you never got that
snooty manner in a village.”
Siuan drew a deep breath before answering. “Siuan Sanche has been stilled.” Her voice did not
even tremble; she was proud of that. “Elaida a’Roihan is the new Amyrlin.” She could not keep a hint
of bite out of that, however.
Mistress Tharne’s face showed no reaction. “Well, that explains some of the orders I’ve gotten.
Some of them, maybe. Stilled her, did they? I thought she’d be Amyrlin forever. I saw her once, a few
years ago in Caemlyn. At a distance. She looked like she could chew harness straps for breakfast.”
Those impossible scarlet curls swung as she shook her head. “Well, done’s done. The Ajahs have
split, haven’t they? Only thing that fits; my orders, and the old buzzard stilled. The Tower’s broken,
and the Blues are running.”
Siuan ground her teeth. She tried telling herself the woman was loyal to the Blue Ajah, not to her
personally, but it did not help. Old buzzard? She’s old enough to be my mother. And if she was, I’d
drown myself. With an effort, she made her voice meek. “My message is important. I must be on my
way as soon as possible. Can you help me?”
“Important, is it? Well, I’m doubting it. Trouble is, I can give you something, but it’s up to you to
cipher it out. Do you want it?” The woman refused to make this any easier.
“Yes, please.”
“Sallie Daera. I don’t know who she is or was, but I was told to give her name to any Blue who
came around looking lost, so to speak. You may not be one of the sisters, but you carry your nose high
enough for one, so there it is. Sallie Daera. Make of it what you will.”
Siuan suppressed a thrill of excitement and made her face dejected. “I never heard of her, either.
I’ll just have to go on looking.”
“If you find them, you tell Aeldene Sedai I’m still loyal, whatever’s happened. I’ve worked for
the Blues so long, I wouldn’t know what to do with myself else.”
“I will tell her,” Siuan said. She had not known that Aeldene was her replacement controlling
the Blues’ eyes-and-ears; the Amyrlin, whatever Ajah she came from, was of all but part of none. “I
suppose you need some reason for not hiring me. I really cannot sing; that should do.”
“As if it mattered to that lot out there.” The big woman quirked an eyebrow and grinned in a way
Siuan did not like. “I’ll think of something, wench. And I’ll give you a bit of advice. If you don’t
climb down a rung or two, some Aes Sedai will take you down the whole ladder. I’m surprised it
hasn’t been done already. Now go on. Get out of here.”
Hateful woman, Siuan growled in her head. If there was a way to manage it, I’d have her
doing penance till her eyes popped. The woman thought she deserved more respect, did she? “Thank
you for your help,” she said coolly, making a curtsy that would have graced any court. “You have
been too kind.”
She was three steps into the common room when Mistress Tharne appeared behind her, raising
her voice in a laughing shout that cut through the noise. “A shy maiden, that one! Legs white and
slender enough to set you all drooling, and she bawled like a baby when I told her she’d have to show
them to you! Just sat right down on the floor and cried! Hips round enough for any taste, and she . . . !”
Siuan stumbled as the tide of laughter rose, never quite drowning out the woman’s recitation.
She managed another three steps, face red as a beet, then fled at a run.
In the street, she paused to get her breath back and let her heart stop pounding. That horrible old
harridan! I should . . . ! It did not matter what she should do; that disgusting woman had told her what

she needed. Not Sallie Daera; not a woman at all. Only a Blue would know, or even suspect. Salidar.
Birthplace of Deane Aryman, the Blue sister who had become Amyrlin after Bonwhin and had
rescued the Tower from the ruin Bonwhin had poised it for. Salidar. One of the last places anyone
would look for Aes Sedai, short of Amadicia itself.
Two men in snowy cloaks and brightly burnished mail were riding down the street toward her,
reluctantly moving their horses aside for wagons. Children of the Light. They could be found
everywhere these days. Tipping her head down, watching the Whitecloaks cautiously from beneath
the brim of her hat, Siuan moved closer to the blue-and-green front of the inn. They glanced at her as
they rode by—hard faces beneath shining conical helmets—and passed on.
Siuan bit her lip in vexation. She had probably called their attention to her by shrinking back.
And if they had seen her face . . . ? Nothing, of course. Whitecloaks might try to kill an Aes Sedai they
found alone, but hers was an Aes Sedai face no longer. Only, they had seen her try to hide from them.
If Duranda Tharne had not upset her so, she would not have made such a foolish error. She could
remember when a little thing like Mistress Tharne’s remarks would not have made her stride waver
in the least, when that overgrown dyed fishwife would not have dared say a word of it. If that
termagant doesn’t like my manner, I’ll . . . What she would do was continue about the business she
was on before Mistress Tharne pummeled her so she could not sit a saddle. Sometimes it was hard
remembering that the days were gone when she could call kings or queens and have them come.
Striding down the street, she glared so hard that some of the wagon drivers bit back the
comments they had been going to make to a pretty young woman alone. Some of them did.
Min sat on a bench against the wall of the crowded common room in The Nine Horse Hitch,
watching a table surrounded by standing men, some with coiled driver’s whips, others wearing the
swords that marked them merchants’ guards. Six more sat shoulder to shoulder around the table. She
could just make out Logain and Leane, sitting on the far side. He wore a disgruntled frown; the other
men hung on Leane’s every smiling word.
The air was thick with pipesmoke, and full of chatter that nearly drowned the music of flute and
tambour and the singing of a girl dancing on a table between the stone fireplaces. Her song had to do
with a woman convincing six men that each was the only man in her life; Min found it interesting even
when it made her blush. The singer darted jealous glances at the crowded table from time to time. Or
rather at Leane.
The tall Domani woman had already been leading Logain by the nose when they entered the inn,
and she had attracted more men like flies to honey with that swaying walk and the smoldering light in
her eyes. There had very nearly been a riot, Logain and the merchants’ guards with hands on swords,
knives being drawn, the stout proprietor and two heavily muscled fellows rushing in with cudgels.
And Leane had doused the flames much as she had ignited them, with a smile here, a few words there,
a pat on the cheek. Even the innkeeper had lingered awhile, grinning like a fool, until his custom
called him away. And Leane thought she needed practice. It hardly seemed fair.
If I could do that to one particular man, I’d be more than satisfied. Maybe she’d teach me—
Light, what am I thinking? She had always been herself, and everyone else could accept her as she
was or not. Now she was thinking about changing what she was, for a man. It was bad enough that she
had to hide herself in a dress, instead of the coat and breeches she had always worn. He’d look at
you in a dress with neckline cut low. You’ve more to show than Leane does, and she—Stop that!
“We have to go south,” Siuan said at her shoulder, and Min gave a start. She had not seen the
other woman come in. “Now.” From the shine in Siuan’s blue eyes, she had learned something.

Whether she would share it was another matter. The woman seemed to think she was still Amyrlin,
most of the time.
“We cannot reach anywhere else with an inn before nightfall,” Min said. “We might as well take
rooms here for the night.” It was pleasant to sleep in a bed again instead of under hedges and in
haystacks, even if she did usually have to share it with Leane and Siuan. Logain was willing to rent
them all rooms, but Siuan was tight with their coin even when Logain was doling it out.
Siuan looked around, but whoever in the common room was not staring at Leane was listening to
the singer. “That isn’t possible. I—I think some Whitecloaks may be asking questions about me.”
Min whistled softly. “Dalyn won’t like that.”
“Then do not tell him.” Siuan shook her head at the gathering about Leane. “Just tell Amaena that
we have to go. He’ll follow. Let us just hope the rest don’t as well.”
Min grinned wryly. Siuan might claim that she did not care that Logain—Dalyn—had taken
charge, mostly by just ignoring her whenever she tried to make him do anything, but she was still
determined to bring him to heel again.
“What is a Nine Horse Hitch, anyway?” she asked, getting to her feet. She had gone out front
hoping for a hint, but the sign over the door bore only the name. “I have seen eight, and ten, but never
nine.”
“In this town,” Siuan said primly, “it is better not to ask.” Sudden spots of color in her cheeks
made Min think that she knew very well. “Go fetch them. We’ve a long way to go, and no time to
waste. And don’t let anyone overhear you.”
Min snorted softly. With that small smile on Leane’s face, none of those men would even see
her. She wished she knew how Siuan had brought herself to the Whitecloaks’ attention. That was the
last thing they needed, and it was not like Siuan to make mistakes. She wished she knew how to make
Rand look at her like those men were looking at Leane. If they were going to be riding all night—and
she suspected they were—maybe Leane would be willing to give her a few tips.

CHAPTER
12

An Old Pipe

Agust of wind swirling dust down the Lugard street caught Gareth Bryne’s velvet hat,
sweeping it from his head directly under one of the lumbering wagons. An iron-rimmed wheel ground
the hat into the hard clay of the street, leaving a flattened ruin behind. For a moment he stared at it,
then walked on. It was showing travel stains anyway, he told himself. His silk coat had been dusty
before reaching Murandy, too; brushing no longer did much good, when he even took the trouble. It
looked more brown than gray, now. He should find something plainer; he was not on his way to a
ball.
Dodging between wagons rumbling down the rutted street, he ignored the drivers’ curses that
followed him—any decent squadman could give better in his sleep—and ducked into a red-roofed inn
called The Wagon Seat. The painting on the sign gave the name an explicit interpretation.
The common room was like every common room he had seen in Lugard, wagon drivers and
merchants’ guards packed in with stablemen, farriers, laborers, every sort of man, all talking or
laughing as loud as they could while drinking as much as they could, one hand for the cup and one to
fondle the serving girls. For that matter, it was not all that much different from common rooms and
taverns in many other towns, though most were considerably milder. A buxom young woman, in a
blouse that seemed about to fall off, capered and sang atop a table at one side of the room, to the
supposed music of two flutes and a twelve-string bittern.
He had little ear for music, but he paused a moment to appreciate her song; she would have gone
over well in any soldiers’ camp he had ever seen. But then, she would have been as popular if she
could not sing a note. Wearing that blouse, she would have found a husband in short order.
Joni and Barim were already there, Joni’s size enough to grant them a table by themselves
despite his thin hair and the bandage he still wore around his temples. They were listening to the girl
sing. Or at least staring at her. He touched each man on the shoulder and nodded toward the side door
that led to the stableyard, where a sullen groom with a squint delivered their horses for three silver
pennies. A year or so earlier Bryne could have bought a fair horse for no more. The troubles to the
west and in Cairhien were playing havoc with trade and prices.
No one spoke until they passed the city gates and were on a seldom-traveled road winding north
toward the River Storn, little more than a wide dirt track. Then Barim said, “They was here
yesterday, my Lord.”
Bryne had learned that much himself. Three pretty young women together, obvious outlanders,
could not pass through a city like Lugard without being remarked. By men, anyway.
“Them and a fellow with shoulders,” Barim went on. “Sounds maybe like that Dalyn that was
with them when they burned down Nem’s barn. Anyway, whoever he is, they was at The Nine Horse

Hitch for a bit, but all they did was drink some and leave. That Domani girl the lads was telling me
about, she nearly kicked up a fuss flashing her smile and swaying about, but then she calmed
everything down again the same way. Burn me, but I’d like to meet me a Domani woman.”
“Did you hear which way they went, Barim?” Bryne asked patiently. He had not been able to
learn that.
“Uh, no, my Lord. But I heard there’s been plenty of Whitecloaks passing through, all heading
west. You think maybe old Pedron Niall’s planning something? Maybe in Altara?”
“That’s not our business anymore, Barim.” Bryne knew his patience sounded a little frayed this
time, but Barim was an old enough campaigner to stick to the matter at hand.
“I know where they went, my Lord,” Joni said. “West, on the Jehannah Road, and pushing hard
by what I heard.” He sounded troubled. “My Lord, I found two merchants’ guards, lads who used to
be in the Guards, and had a drink with them. Happens they were in a stew called The Good Night’s
Ride when that girl Mara came in and asked for a job singing. She didn’t get it—didn’t want to show
her legs the way the singers in most of these places do, as who can blame her?—and she left. From
what Barim told me, it was right after that they all set off west. I don’t like it, my Lord. She isn’t the
kind of girl to want a job in a place like that. I think she’s trying to get away from that Dalyn fellow.”
Strangely, despite the lump on his head, Joni had no animosity toward the three young women. It
was his opinion, often expressed since leaving the manor, that the girls were in some sort of
predicament and needed to be rescued. Bryne suspected that if he did catch up to the young women
and take them back to his estate, Joni would be after him to turn them over to Joni’s daughters to
mother.
Barim had no such feelings. “Ghealdan.” He scowled. “Or maybe Altara, or Amadicia. We’ll
kiss the Dark One getting them back. Hardly seems worth the annoyance for a barn and some cows.”
Bryne said nothing. They had followed the girls this far, and Murandy was a bad place for
Andormen; too many border troubles over too many years. Only a fool would chase into Murandy
after an oathbreaker’s eyes. How much bigger a fool to follow halfway across the world?
“Those lads I talked to,” Joni said diffidently. “My Lord, it seems a lot of the old lads who—
who served under you are being sent off.” Emboldened by Bryne’s silence, he went on. “Lots of new
fellows in. Lots. Those lads said at least four or five for every one told he wasn’t wanted anymore.
The sort that like to cause trouble more than stop it. There’s some calling themselves the White Lions
who only answer to this Gaebril”—he spat to show what he thought of that—“and a bunch more not
part of the Guards at all. Not House levies. Near as they could say, Gaebril’s got ten times as many
men under arms as there are Guards, and they’ve all sworn to the throne of Andor, but not to the
Queen.”
“That’s no longer our business, either,” Bryne said curtly. Barim had his tongue stuffed into his
cheek, the way he always did when he knew something he either did not want to tell or was not sure
was important enough. “What is it, Barim? Out with it, man.”
The leather-faced fellow stared at him in amazement. Barim had never figured out how Bryne
knew when he was holding back. “Well, my Lord, some of the folks I talked to said some of those
Whitecloaks yesterday was asking questions. About a girl sounds like that Mara. Wanted to know
who she was, where she went. Like that. I heard they got real interested when they learned she was
gone. If they’re after her, she could be hanged before we ever find her. If they have to go to the
trouble of chasing her down, they might not ask too many questions about whether she’s really a
Darkfriend. Or whatever it is they’re after her for.”
Bryne frowned. Whitecloaks? What would the Children of the Light want with Mara? He would

never believe she was a Darkfriend. But then, he had seen a baby-faced young fellow hanged in
Caemlyn, a Darkfriend who had been teaching children in the streets about the glories of the Dark One
—the Great Lord of the Dark, he had called him. The lad had killed nine of them in three years, as
near as could be discovered, when they looked like turning him in. No. That girl is no Darkfriend,
and I’ll stake my life on it. Whitecloaks were suspicious of everyone. And if they took it into their
heads that she had fled Lugard to avoid them . . .
He booted Traveler to a canter. The big-nosed bay gelding was not flashy, but he had endurance,
and courage. The other two caught up soon enough, and they kept their mouths shut, seeing the mood
he was in.
Two miles or so from Lugard, he turned off into a thicket of oak and leatherleaf. The rest of his
men had made a temporary camp here, in a clear space under thick, spreading oak limbs. Several
small, smokeless fires were burning; they would take any opportunity to brew up some tea. Some
were dozing; sleep was another thing an old soldier never missed a chance to snatch.
Those awake kicked the rest out of their naps, and they all looked up at him. For a moment he sat
his saddle studying them. Gray hair and bald heads and age-creased faces. Still hard and fit, but even
so . . . He had been a fool to risk bringing them into Murandy just because he had to know why a
woman had broken an oath. And maybe with Whitecloaks after them. No telling how far or how long
from home before it was done. If he turned back now, they would have been gone more than a month
before they saw Kore Springs again. If he went on, there was no guarantee the chase would stop short
of the Aryth Ocean. He should be taking these men, and himself, home. He should. He had no call to
ask them to try snatching those girls out of Whitecloak hands. He could leave Mara to Whitecloak
justice.
“We will be heading west,” he announced, and immediately there was a scramble of dousing
fires with the tea and fastening pots to saddles. “We will have to press hard. I mean to catch them in
Altara, if I can, but if not, there’s no telling where they’ll lead us. You could see Jehannah or Amador
or Ebou Dar before we’re done.” He affected a laugh. “You’ll find out how tough you are if we reach
Ebou Dar. They’ve taverns there where the barmaids skin Illianers for dinner and spit Whitecloaks
for sport.”
They laughed harder than the jest was worth.
“We won’t worry with you along, my Lord,” Thad cackled, stuffing his tin cup into his
saddlebags. His face was wrinkled like crumpled leather. “Why, I hear you had a run-in with the
Amyrlin herself once, and—” Jar Silvin kicked him on the ankle, and he rounded on the younger man
—gray-haired, but still younger—with a clenched fist. “Why’d you do that, Silvin? You want a broke
head, you just—What?” The meaningful glares Silvin and some of the others were giving him finally
sank in. “Oh. Oh, yes.” He buried himself in checking the girth straps on his saddle, but no one was
laughing anymore.
Bryne forced his face to relax from stoniness. It was time he put the past in the past. Just because
a woman whose bed he had shared—and more, he had thought—just because that woman looked at
him as though she had never known him was no reason to stop speaking her name. Just because she
had exiled him from Caemlyn, on pain of death, for giving her the advice he had sworn to give. . . . If
she came a cropper with this Lord Gaebril who had suddenly appeared in Caemlyn, it was no longer
any concern of his. She had told him, in a voice as flat and cold as smooth ice, that his name would
never be spoken in the palace again, that only his long service kept her from sending him to the
headsman for treason. Treason! He needed to keep spirits up, especially if this turned into a long
chase.

Hooking a knee around the high cantle of his saddle, he took out his pipe and pouch and filled his
pipe with tabac. The bowl was carved with a wild bull collared with the Rose Crown of Andor. For
a thousand years that had been the sign of House Bryne; strength and courage in service of the queen.
He needed a new pipe; this one was old.
“I didn’t come out of that as well as you might have heard.” He leaned down for one of the men
to hand him a twig still glowing from one of the spent fires, then straightened to puff his pipe alight.
“It was some three years ago. The Amyrlin was making a progression. Cairhien, Tear, Illian, and
finishing up in Caemlyn before returning to Tar Valon. At that time we were having problems with
Murandian border lords—as usual.” Laughter rippled; they had all served on the Murandian border at
one time or another. “I had sent some of the Guards down to set the Murandians straight on who
owned the sheep and cattle on our side of the border. I never expected the Amyrlin to take an
interest.” He certainly had their attention; preparations to leave were still going on, but more slowly.
“Siuan Sanche and Elaida closeted themselves with Morgase—” There; he had said her name
again, and it did not even smart. “—and when they came out, Morgase was half thunderhead, with
lightning shooting out of her eyes, and half ten-year-old who’d been hauled up by her mother for
stealing honeycakes. She’s a tough woman, but caught between Elaida and the Amyrlin Seat . . .” He
shook his head, and they chuckled; Aes Sedai attentions were one thing none of them envied lords and
rulers. “She ordered me to remove all troops from the border with Murandy immediately. I asked her
to discuss it with me in private, and Siuan Sanche jumped all over me. In front of half the court, she
chewed me up one side and down the other like a raw recruit. Said if I couldn’t do as I was told,
she’d use me for fishbait.” He had had to beg her pardon before it was done—in front of everyone,
for trying to do as he had been sworn to do—but there was no need to add that. Even at the end he had
not been sure that she would not make Morgase behead him, or have it done herself.
“Must have meant to catch herself a mighty big fish,” someone laughed, and others joined in.
“The upshot was,” Bryne went on, “my hide got singed, and the Guards were ordered back from
the border. So if you’re looking to me to protect you in Ebou Dar, just remember it’s my opinion those
barmaids would hang the Amyrlin out to dry along with the rest of us.” They roared with mirth.
“Did you ever find out what it was about, my Lord?” Joni wanted to know.
Bryne shook his head. “Aes Sedai business of some sort, I expect. They don’t tell the likes of
you and me what they are up to.” That earned a few chuckles as well.
They mounted up with an alacrity that belied their ages. Some of them are no older than me, he
thought wryly. Too old to go chasing after a pretty pair of eyes young enough to be his daughter’s if
not his granddaughter’s. I only want to know why she broke oath, he told himself firmly. Only that.
Raising his hand, he signaled forward, and they headed west, leaving a trail of dust. It would
take hard riding to catch up. But he meant to. In Ebou Dar or the Pit of Doom, he would find them.

CHAPTER

A Small Room in Sienda

Elayne held herself against the swaying of the coach on its leather hinges, trying to ignore
Nynaeve’s sour face across from her. The curtains were drawn back despite a sprinkling of dust that
sometimes whipped through the windows; the breeze blew away some of the late-afternoon heat.
Rolling, forested hills streamed past, the woods occasionally broken by short stretches of farmland. A
lord’s manor, in the fashion of Amadicia, topped one of the hills a few miles from the road, a huge
stone foundation fifty feet high with an elaborate wooden structure atop that, all ornate balconies and
red-tiled roofs. Once it all would have been stone, but many years had passed since a lord needed a
fortress in Amadicia, and the king’s law now required the wooden construction. No rebel lord would
be able to hold out against the king for long. Of course, the Children of the Light were exempted from
that law; they were immune to a number of Amadician laws. She had had to learn something of the
laws and customs of other countries from the time she was a child.
Cleared fields dotted the distant hills, too, like brown patches on a mostly green cloth, the men
working them seeming ants. Everything looked dry; one bolt of lighting would set a fire that could
burn for leagues. But lightning meant rain, and the few clouds in the sky were too high and thin for
that. Idly she wondered whether she could make it rain. She had learned considerable control over
weather. Still, it was very difficult if you had to begin with nothing.
“Is my Lady bored?” Nynaeve asked acidly. “The way my Lady is staring at the countryside—
down my Lady’s nose—I think my Lady must want to travel faster.” Reaching back over her head, she
pushed open a small flap and shouted, “More speed, Thom. Don’t argue with me! You hold your
tongue, too, Juilin Thief-catcher! I said more speed!”
The wooden flap banged down, but Elayne could still hear Thom muttering loudly. Cursing, very
likely; Nynaeve had been barking at the men all day. A moment later his whip cracked, and the coach
racketed ahead even faster, rocking so hard that both women bounced on the golden-colored silk
seats. The silk had been thoroughly dusted when Thom bought the vehicle, but the padding had long
since gone hard. Yet jounced about as she was, the set of Nynaeve’s jaw said she would not ask
Thom to slow again right after ordering him to go faster.
“Please, Nynaeve,” Elayne said. “I—” The other woman cut her off.
“Is my Lady uncomfortable? I know ladies are used to comfort, the sort of thing a poor maid
wouldn’t know about, but surely my Lady wants to make the next town before dark? So my Lady’s
maid can serve my Lady’s supper and turn down my Lady’s bed?” Her teeth clicked shut as the seat
coming up met her coming down, and she glowered at Elayne as though it were her fault.
Elayne sighed heavily. Nynaeve had seen the point, back in Mardecin. A lady never traveled
without a maid, and two ladies would probably have a pair. Unless they put Thom or Juilin in a dress,

that meant one of them. Nynaeve had seen that Elayne knew more of how ladies behaved; she had put
it very gently, and Nynaeve usually knew sense when she heard it. Usually. But that was back in
Mistress Macura’s shop, after they had filled the two women with their own horrible concoction.
Leaving Mardecin, they had traveled hard until midnight to reach a small village with an inn,
where they had roused the innkeeper from his bed to rent two cramped rooms with narrow beds,
waking before first light yesterday to push on, skirting around Amador by a few miles. Neither of
them would be taken for anything but what they claimed, on sight, but neither felt comfortable about
passing through a great city full of Whitecloaks. The Fortress of the Light was in Amador. Elayne had
heard it said that the king reigned in Amador, but Pedron Niall ruled.
The trouble had started last night, at a place called Bellon, on a muddy stream grandly named the
Gaean River, some twenty miles or so beyond the capital. The Bellon Ford Inn was larger than the
first, and Mistress Alfara, the innkeeper, offered the Lady Morelin a private dining room, which
Elayne could not very well refuse. Mistress Alfara had been sure that only the Lady Morelin’s maid,
Nana, would know how to serve her properly; ladies did require everything just so, the woman said,
as well they should, and her girls were simply not used to ladies. Nana would know exactly how the
Lady Morelin wanted her bed turned down, and would prepare her a nice bath after a hot day of
travel. The list of things that Nana would do exactly right for her mistress had been endless.
Elayne was not sure whether Amadician nobility expected such or Mistress Alfara was just
getting work out of an outlander’s servant. She had tried to spare Nynaeve, but the woman had been
as full of “as you wish” and “my Lady is most particular” as the innkeeper. She would have seemed a
fool, or at least odd, to press it. They were trying to avoid attracting undue attention.
As long as they had been in Bellon, Nynaeve had acted the perfect lady’s maid in public. In
private was another matter. Elayne wished the woman would just revert to herself instead of
bludgeoning her with a lady’s maid from the Blight. Apologies had been met with “my Lady is too
kind” or simply ignored. I will not apologize again, she thought for the fiftieth time. Not for what
was not my fault.
“I have been thinking, Nynaeve.” Gripping a hanging strap, she felt like the ball in the children’s
game called Bounce in Andor, where you tried to keep a colorful wooden ball bouncing up and down
on a paddle. She would not ask for the coach to be slowed, though. She could stand it as long as
Nynaeve did. The woman was so stubborn! “I want to reach Tar Valon and find out what is going on,
but—”
“My Lady has been thinking? My Lady must have a headache from all that effort. I will make my
Lady a nice tea of sheepstongue root and red daisy as soon as—”
“Be quiet, Nana,” Elayne said, calmly but firmly; it was her very best imitation of her mother.
Nynaeve’s jaw dropped. “If you pull that braid at me, you can ride on the roof with the baggage.”
Nynaeve made a strangled sound, trying so hard to talk that nothing came out. Quite satisfactory.
“Sometimes you seem to think I am still a child, but you are the one behaving like a child. I did not
ask you to wash my back, but I would have had to wrestle to stop you. I did offer to scrub yours in
turn, remember. And I offered to sleep in the trundle bed. But you climbed in and wouldn’t get out.
Stop sulking. If you like, I will be the maid at the next inn.” It would probably be a disaster. Nynaeve
would shout at Thom in public, or box someone’s ears. But anything for a little peace. “We can stop
right now and change in the trees.”
“We chose the gowns to fit you,” the other woman muttered after a moment. Pushing the flap
open again, she shouted, “Slow down! Are you trying to kill us? Fool men!”
There was dead silence from above as the coach’s speed diminished to something much more

reasonable, but Elayne would have wagered the two men were talking. She straightened her hair as
best she could without a mirror. It was still startling to see those glistening black tresses when she did
look in one. The green silk was going to need a thorough brushing itself.
“What was it you were thinking, Elayne?” Nynaeve asked. Crimson stained her cheeks. At least
she knew that Elayne was right, but backing down was very likely as much apology as she would ever
give.
“We are rushing back to Tar Valon, but do we really have any idea what awaits us in the
Tower? If the Amyrlin truly did give those orders . . . I do not really believe it, and I cannot
understand it, but I do not intend to walk into the Tower until I do. ‘A fool puts her hand into a hollow
tree without finding out what’s inside first.’ ”
“A wise woman, Lini,” Nynaeve said. “We may learn more if I see another bunch of yellow
flowers hanging upside down, but until then I think we should behave as though the Black Ajah itself
has control of the Tower.”
“Mistress Macura will have sent off another pigeon to Narenwin by now. With descriptions of
this coach, and the dresses we took, and most likely Thom and Juilin too.”
“It cannot be helped. This would not have happened if we hadn’t dawdled across Tarabon. We
should have taken ship.” Elayne gaped at her accusatory tone, and Nynaeve had the grace to blush
again. “Well, done is done. Moiraine knows Siuan Sanche. Perhaps Egwene can ask her if—”
Abruptly the coach lurched to a halt, throwing Elayne forward on top of Nynaeve. She could
hear horses screaming and thrashing as she frantically untangled herself, Nynaeve pushing her off as
well.
Embracing saidar, she put her head out of the window—and released it again in relief. Here
was something of a sort that she had seen pass through Caemlyn more than once. A traveling
menagerie was camped amid afternoon shadows in a large clearing by the side of the road. A great,
black-maned lion lay half-asleep in one cage that took up the entire back of a wagon, while his two
consorts paced in the confines of another. A third cage stood open; in front of it a woman was making
two black bears with white faces balance themselves on big red balls. Another cage held what
appeared to be a large, hairy boar, except that its snout was too pointed and it had toes with claws;
that came from the Aiel Waste, she knew, and was called a capar. Other cages held other animals,
and brightly colored birds, but unlike any menagerie she had ever seen, this one traveled with human
performers: two men were juggling ribbon-twined hoops between them, four acrobats were
practicing standing on one another’s shoulders in a tall column, and a woman was feeding a dozen
dogs that walked on their hind legs and did backflips for her. In the background, some other men were
putting up two tall poles; she had no idea what they were for.
None of that was what had the horses rearing in their harness and rolling their eyes, though,
despite all that Thom could do with the reins. She could smell the lions herself, but it was at three
huge, wrinkled gray animals that the horses gazed, wild-eyed. Two were as tall as the coach, with big
ears and great curving tusks beside a long nose that dangled to the ground. The third, shorter than the
horses if likely as heavy, had no tusks. A baby, she supposed. A woman with pale yellow hair was
scratching that one behind the ear with a heavy, hooked goad. Elayne had seen creatures like this
before, too. And had never expected to see them again.
A tall, dark-haired man strode out of the camp, of all things in this heat wearing a red silk cloak
that he flourished as he made an elegant bow. He was good-looking, with a well-turned leg, and very
much aware of both things. “Forgive me, my Lady, if the giant boar-horses frightened your animals.”
As he straightened, he beckoned two of his men to help quiet the horses, then paused, staring at her,

and murmured, “Be still, my heart.” It was just loud enough for Elayne to be sure she was supposed to
hear. “I am Valan Luca, my Lady, showman extraordinary. Your presence overwhelms me.” He made
another bow, even more elaborate than the first.
Elayne shared a look with Nynaeve, catching the same amused smile that she knew she herself
wore. A man very full of himself, this Valan Luca. His men did seem to be very good at soothing the
horses; they still snorted and stamped, but their eyes were not so wide as they had been. Thom and
Juilin were staring at the strange animals almost as hard as the horses were.
“Boar-horses, Master Luca?” Elayne said. “Where do they come from?”
“Giant boar-horses, my Lady” was the ready reply, “from fabled Shara, where I myself led an
expedition into a wilderness full of strange civilizations and stranger sights to trap them. It would
fascinate me to tell you of them. Gigantic people twice the size of Ogier.” He made grand gestures to
illustrate. “Beings with no heads. Birds big enough to carry off a full-grown bull. Snakes that can
swallow a man. Cities made of solid gold. Descend, my Lady, and let me tell you.”
Elayne had no doubt that Luca would fascinate himself with his own tales, but she certainly
doubted that those animals came from Shara. For one thing, even the Sea Folk saw no more of Shara
than the walled ports they were confined to; any who went beyond the walls was never seen again.
The Aiel knew little more. For another, she and Nynaeve had both seen creatures like these in Falme,
during the Seanchan invasion. The Seanchan used them for work animals, and for war.
“I think not, Master Luca,” she told him.
“Then let us perform for you,” he said quickly. “As you can see, this is no ordinary wandering
menagerie, but something entirely new. A private performance. Tumblers, jugglers, trained animals,
the strongest man in the world. Even fireworks. We have an Illuminator with us. We are on our way
to Ghealdan, and tomorrow we will be gone on the wind. But for a pittance—”
“My mistress said she thinks not,” Nynaeve broke in. “She has better things to spend her money
on than looking at animals.” In fact, she herself kept a tight fist on all their coin, reluctantly doling out
what they needed. She seemed to think everything should cost what it had back in her Two Rivers.
“Why would you want to go to Ghealdan, Master Luca?” Elayne asked. The other woman did
make rough spots and leave them to her to smooth over. “I hear there is a great deal of trouble there. I
hear the army has not been able to suppress this man called the Prophet, with his preaching of the
Dragon Reborn. Surely you do not want to travel into riots.”
“Greatly exaggerated, my Lady. Greatly exaggerated. Where there are crowds, people want to be
entertained. And where people want to be entertained, my show is always welcome.” Luca hesitated,
then stepped closer to the coach. An embarrassed look crossed his face as he gazed up into Elayne’s
eyes. “My Lady, the truth of the matter is that you would do me a very great favor by allowing me to
perform for you. The fact is that one of the boar-horses caused a little trouble in the next town up the
road. It was an accident,” he added hastily, “I assure you. They are gentle creatures. Not dangerous at
all. But not only are the people of Sienda unwilling to let me put on a show, or even come to one here
. . . Well, it took all of my coin to pay for the damages, and the fines.” He winced. “Especially the
fines. If you allowed me to entertain you—for a trifle, truly—I would name you as patroness of my
show wherever we go across the world, spreading the fame of your generosity, my Lady . . . ?”
“Morelin,” she said. “The Lady Morelin of House Samared.” With her new hair, she could pass
for Cairhienin. She had no time to see his show, as much as she would have enjoyed it another time,
and she told him so, adding, “But I will help you a little, if you have no money. Give him something,
Nana, to help him on his way to Ghealdan.” The last thing she wanted was him “spreading her fame,”
but helping the poor and those in distress was a duty she would not slight when she had the means,

even in a foreign land.
Grumbling, Nynaeve dug a purse out of her belt pouch and dipped into it. She leaned out of the
coach enough to press Luca’s hand around what she gave him. He looked startled as she said, “If you
took a decent job of work, you would not have to beg. Drive on, Thom!”
Thom’s whip cracked, and Elayne was thrown back into her seat. “You did not have to be rude,”
she said. “Or so abrupt. What did you give him?”
“A silver penny,” Nynaeve replied calmly, putting the purse back into her pouch. “And more
than he deserved.”
“Nynaeve,” Elayne groaned. “The man probably thinks we were making sport of him.”
Nynaeve sniffed. “With those shoulders, a good day’s work would not kill him.”
Elayne kept silent, though she did not agree. Not exactly. Certainly work would not harm the
man, but she did not think there was much available. Not that I think Master Luca would accept
work that didn’t allow him to wear that cape. If she brought it up, though, Nynaeve would probably
argue—when she gently pointed out things that Nynaeve did not know, the woman was quite capable
of accusing her of having an arrogant manner, or of lecturing—and Valan Luca was hardly worth
another altercation so soon after smoothing over the last.
The shadows were lengthening by the time they reached Sienda, a sizable village of stone and
thatch with two inns. The first, The King’s Lancer, had a gaping hole where the front door had been,
and a crowd was watching workmen make repairs. Perhaps Master Luca’s “boar-horse” had not liked
the sign, propped up beside the hole now, a charging soldier with lance lowered. It seemed to have
been ripped down somehow.
Surprisingly, there were even more Whitecloaks in the crowded dirt streets than back in
Mardecin, far more, and other soldiers besides, men in mail and conical steel caps whose blue cloaks
bore the Star and Thistle of Amadicia. There must be garrisons nearby. The King’s men and the
Whitecloaks did not seem to like each other at all. They either brushed by as if the man wearing the
wrong color did not exist, or else with challenging stares little short of drawn swords. Some of the
white-cloaked men had red shepherd’s crooks behind the sunbursts on their cloaks. The Hand of the
Light, those named themselves, the Hand that seeks out truth, but everyone else called them
Questioners. Even the other Whitecloaks kept clear of them.
All in all, it was enough to make Elayne’s stomach clench. But there was no more than another
hour’s sunlight left, if that, and that was taking into account the late-summer sunsets. Even driving half
the night again would not guarantee another inn ahead, and driving on this late might call attention.
Besides, they had reason to halt early today.
She exchanged looks with Nynaeve, and after a moment the other woman nodded and said, “We
have to stop.”
When the coach drew up in front of The Light of Truth, Juilin hopped down to open the door, and
Nynaeve waited with a deferential look on her face for him to hand Elayne down. She did flash
Elayne a smile, though; she would not slide back into sulks. The leather scrip she slung from her
shoulder appeared a bit incongruous, but not too much so, Elayne hoped. Now that Nynaeve had
acquired a stock of herbs and ointments again, she did not mean to let them out of her sight.
From her first sight of the inn’s sign—a flaring golden sun like that the Children wore on their
cloaks—she wished the “boar-horse” had taken exception to this place instead of the other. At least
there was no shepherd’s crook behind it. Half the men filling the common room wore snowy white
cloaks, their helmets set on the tables in front of them. She took a deep breath and a firm hold on
herself not to spin on her heel and leave.

Aside from the soldiers, it was a pleasant inn, with high-beamed ceilings and dark polished
paneling. Cut green branches decorated the cold hearths of two large fireplaces, and good cooking
smells wafted from the kitchens. The white-aproned serving maids all seemed cheerful as they
scurried among the tables with trays of wine and ale and food.
The arrival of a lady created little stir, this close to the capital. Or perhaps it was because of
that lord’s manor. A few men looked at her; more eyed her “maid” with interest, though Nynaeve’s
stern frown, when she realized they were staring at her, quickly turned them back to their wine.
Nynaeve seemed to think a man looking was a crime, even if he said nothing and did not leer. Given
that, sometimes Elayne wondered why she did not wear less becoming clothes. She had had to work
very hard to make sure that simple gray dress fit the other woman properly. Nynaeve was hopeless
with a needle when it came to fine work.
The innkeeper, Mistress Jharen, was a plump woman with long gray curls, a warm smile, and
searching dark eyes. Elayne suspected she could spot a worn hem or a flat purse at ten paces. They
obviously passed muster, for she made a deep curtsy, spreading her gray skirts wide, and made
effusive welcome, inquiring whether the Lady was on her way to or from Amador.
“From,” Elayne replied with a languid hauteur. “The city’s balls were most enjoyable, and King
Ailron is quite as handsome as they say, which is not always so for kings but I must return to my
estates. I require a room for myself and Nana, and something for my footman and driver.” Thinking of
Nynaeve and the trundle, she added, “I must have two full beds. I need Nana close, and if she has only
a trundle, she will keep me awake with her snoring.” Nynaeve’s respectful face slipped—just a
fraction, thankfully—but it was quite true. She had snored terribly.
“Of course, my Lady,” the plump innkeeper said. “I have just the thing. But your men will have
to bed down in the stable, in the hayloft. I am quite crowded, as you can see. A troupe of vagabonds
brought some horrible great animals into the village yesterday and one of them quite destroyed The
King’s Lancer. Poor Sim has lost half his custom or more, and they’ve all come here.” Mistress
Jharen’s smile was more satisfaction than commiseration. “I do have one room left, however.”
“I am sure it will do very well. If you will send up a light repast and some washwater, I think I
shall retire early.” There was still sunlight showing in the windows, but she put a hand delicately
over her mouth as if stifling a yawn.
“Of course, my Lady. As you wish. This way.”
Mistress Jharen seemed to think she had to keep Elayne entertained as she showed them to the
second floor. She went on the whole way about the crowding at the inn and how it was a miracle that
she had a room left, about the vagrants with their animals and how they had been chased out of town
and good riddance to rubbish, about all the nobles who had stayed at her establishment over the years,
even the Lord Captain Commander of the Children, once. Why, a Hunter of the Horn had come
through just the day before, on his way to Tear, where they said the Stone of Tear had fallen into the
hands of some false Dragon, and was it not horrible wickedness that men could do such things? “I
hope they never find it.” The innkeeper’s gray curls swung as she shook her head.
“The Horn of Valere?” Elayne said. “Why ever not?”
“Why, my Lady, if they find it, it means the Last Battle is coming. The Dark One breaking free.”
Mistress Jharen shivered. “The Light send the Horn is never found. That way, the Last Battle cannot
happen, can it?” There did not seem to be much answer to such curious logic.
The bedchamber was snug, if not exactly cramped. Two narrow beds with striped coverlets
stood to either side of a window looking out onto the street, and little more than walking room
separated them from each other or the white-plastered walls. A small table holding a lamp and

tinderbox between the beds, a tiny, flowered rug, and a washstand with a small mirror above it
completed the furnishings. Everything was clean and well polished, at least.
The innkeeper plumped the pillows and smoothed the coverlets and said the mattresses were the
best goose down and the Lady’s men would be bringing her chests up by the back stairs and
everything would be very cozy, there was a good breeze at night if the Lady opened the window and
left the door cracked. As though she would sleep with her door open to a public hallway. Two
aproned girls arrived with a large blue pitcher of steaming water and a large lacquered tray covered
with a white cloth before Elayne managed to get Mistress Jharen out. The shape of a wine pitcher and
two cups mounded up one side of the cloth.
“I think she believed we might go to The King’s Lancer even with a hole in it,” she said, once
the door was firmly shut. Looking around the room, she grimaced. There would barely be room for
them and the chests. “I am not certain we shouldn’t.”
“I do not snore,” Nynaeve said in a tight voice.
“Of course you do not. I had to say something though.”
Nynaeve gave a loud harrumph, but all she said was “I am glad I am tired enough to go to sleep.
Aside from that forkroot, I did not recognize anything to aid sleep in what that Macura woman had.”
It took Thom and Juilin three trips to bring the iron-bound wooden chests up, grumbling all the
while, the way men did, about having to haul them up the narrow stairs at the rear of the inn. They
were muttering about being made to sleep in the stables, too, when they brought in the first one
between them—it had leaf-shaped hinges; the bulk of their money and valuables were in the bottom of
that, including the recovered ter’angreal—but one glance at the room and they shared a look and shut
their mouths. About that, at least.
“We’re going to see what we can learn in the common room,” Thom said once the last chest was
jammed in. Barely enough space remained to reach the washstand.
“And maybe take a walk around the village,” Juilin added. “Men talk when there’s as much
dislike as I saw in the street.”
“That will be very good,” Elayne said. They did so want to think they had more to do than haul
and carry. It had been so in Tanchico—and Mardecin, of course—and might well be again, but hardly
here. “Do be careful not to get into any trouble with the Whitecloaks, now.” A long-suffering look
passed between them, just as if she had not seen both with bruised and bleeding faces after jaunts for
information, but she forgave them, and smiled at Thom. “I cannot wait to hear what you learn.”
“In the morning,” Nynaeve said firmly. She was looking away from Elayne so hard that she might
as well have been glowering at her. “If you disturb us before then for less than Trollocs, you’ll learn
the reason why.”
The glance that passed between the two men spoke volumes—it made Nynaeve’s eyebrows rise
sharply—but once she had reluctantly handed over a few coins, they left agreeing to let the women
sleep untroubled.
“If I cannot even speak to Thom,” Elayne began when they were gone, but Nynaeve cut her off.
“I am not having them walk in on me asleep in my shift.” She was awkwardly undoing the
buttons down the back of her dress. Elayne went to help her, and she said, “I can manage. You get the
ring out for me.”
With a sniff, Elayne pulled up her skirt to reach the small pocket she had sewn to the underside.
If Nynaeve wanted to be peevish, let her; she would not respond even if Nynaeve began ranting again.
There were two rings in the pocket. She left the golden Great Serpent she had been given on being
raised to Accepted, and took out the stone ring.

All flecks and stripes of red and blue and brown, it was just too large to fit a finger, and
flattened and twisted besides. Odd as it seemed, the ring had only one edge; a finger drawn along that
edge would circle inside and out before coming back to where it began. It was a ter’angreal, and
what it did was allow access to Tel’aran’rhiod, even for someone who did not have the Talent that
Egwene and the Aiel dreamwalkers shared. All that was needed was to sleep with it next to your
skin. Unlike the two ter’angreal they had recovered from the Black Ajah, it did not require
channeling. For all Elayne knew, even a man might be able to use it.
Clad only in her linen shift, Nynaeve threaded the ring onto the leather thong with Lan’s signet
and her own Great Serpent, then reknotted and hung it back around her neck before lying down atop
one of the beds. Carefully tucking the rings in next to her skin, she settled her head on the pillows.
“Is there time before Egwene and the Wise Ones get there?” Elayne asked. “I can never reason
out what hour it is in the Waste.”
“There is time unless she comes early, which she won’t. The Wise Ones keep her on a very short
leash. It will do her good, in the long run. She was always headstrong.” Nynaeve opened her eyes,
looking right at her—at her!—as if that could stand for her as well.
“Remember to tell Egwene to let Rand know that I am thinking of him.” She wasnot going to let
the woman start a row. “Tell her to . . . tell him that I love him, and only him.” There. She had it out.
Nynaeve rolled her eyes in what was really a most offensive way. “If you wish me to,” she said
dryly, snuggling herself into the pillows.
As the other woman’s breathing began to slow, Elayne pushed one of the chests against the door
and sat on it to wait. She always hated waiting. It would serve Nynaeve right if she went down to the
common room. Thom would probably still be there, and . . . And nothing. He was supposed to be her
coachman. She wondered whether Nynaeve had thought of that before agreeing to be the maid. With a
sigh, she leaned back against the door. She did hate waiting.

CHAPTER

Meetings

The effects of the ring ter’angreal did not startle Nynaeve anymore. She was in the place she
had been thinking of when sleep closed in, the great chamber in Tear called the Heart of the Stone,
within the massive fortress called the Stone of Tear. The gilded stand-lamps were unlit, but pale light
seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere, to simply be all around her, fading into dim shadows
in the distance. At least it was not hot; it never seemed hot or cold in Tel’aran’rhiod.
Huge redstone columns ran off in every direction, the vaulted dome far above lost in dim
shadows along with more golden lamps hanging on golden chains. The pale floorstones beneath her
feet were worn; the High Lords of Tear had come to this chamber—in the waking world, of course—
only when their law and custom demanded, but they had come ever since the Breaking of the World.
Centered beneath the dome was Callandor, apparently a glittering sword made of crystal, driven half
its length into the stone of the floor. Just as Rand had left it.
She did not go near Callandor. Rand claimed to have woven traps around it with saidin, traps
that no woman could see. She expected they would be nasty—the best of men could be vicious when
they tried to be devious—nasty and just as primed for a woman as for the men who might use that
sa’angreal. He had meant to guard it against those in the Tower as much as the Forsaken. Aside from
Rand himself, the one who touched Callandor might die or worse.
That was a fact of Tel’aran’rhiod. What was in the waking world was here, too, although the
reverse was not always so. The World of Dreams, the Unseen World, reflected the waking world, if
sometimes in odd ways, and perhaps other worlds as well. Verin Sedai had told Egwene that there
was a pattern woven of worlds, of the reality here and others, just as the weaving of people’s lives
made up the Pattern of the Ages. Tel’aran’rhiod touched them all, yet few could enter except
accidentally, for unknowing moments, during their own mundane dreams. Dangerous moments for
those dreamers, though they never knew it unless they were very unlucky. Another fact of
Tel’aran’rhiod was that what happened to the dreamer here happened in the waking world, too. To
die in the World of Dreams was to die in fact.
She had the sensation of being watched from the dimnesses between the columns, but it did not
trouble her. It was not Moghedien. Imaginary eyes; there are no watchers. I told Elayne to ignore
them, and here I . . . Moghedien would certainly do more than look. Even so, she wished she were
angry enough to channel. Not that she was frightened, of course. Only not angry. Not frightened at all.
The twisted stone ring felt light, as if it were trying to drift up out of her shift, reminding her that
she was wearing only that. As soon as she thought of clothing herself, she was in a dress. It was a
trick of Tel’aran’rhiod that she liked; in some ways channeling was unnecessary, for here she could
do things that she doubted any Aes Sedai had ever done with the Power. It was not the dress she had

expected, though; not good stout Two Rivers wool. The high neck trimmed in Jaerecruz lace came
right up under her chin, but pale yellow silk draped her in folds that clung revealingly. How many
times had she called Taraboner gowns like this indecent when she had worn them to blend into
Tanchico? It seemed that she had grown more used to them than she knew.
Giving her braid a sharp pull for the waywardness of her own mind, she left the dress as it was.
The gown might not be as she wanted, but she was no flighty girl to go leaping and squealing over it.
A dress is a dress. She would wear it when Egwene arrived, with whichever of the Wise Ones
accompanied her this time, and if any of them said a word . . . I did not come early to blather at
myself about dresses!
“Birgitte?” Silence answered her, and she raised her voice, though it should not have been
necessary. In this place, this particular woman could hear her own name spoken on the other side of
the world. “Birgitte?”
A woman stepped out from among the columns, blue eyes calm and proudly confident, her
golden hair in a long braid more intricate than Nynaeve’s own. Her short white coat and voluminous
yellow silk trousers, gathered at the ankles above short boots with raised heels, were garments of
more than two thousand years ago that she had taken a liking to. The arrows in the quiver at her side
appeared to be silver, and so did the bow she carried.
“Is Gaidal about?” Nynaeve asked. He was usually close by Birgitte, and he made Nynaeve
nervous, refusing to acknowledge her existence, scowling when Birgitte spoke to her. It had been
something of a shock at first to find Gaidal Cain and Birgitte—long-dead heroes linked in so many
stories and legends—in Tel’aran’rhiod. But, as Birgitte herself had said, where better for heroes
bound to the Wheel of Time to await rebirth than in a dream? A dream that had existed as long as the
Wheel. It was they, Birgitte and Gaidal Cain and Rogosh Eagle-eye and Artur Hawkwing and all the
others, that the Horn of Valere would summon back to fight at Tarmon Gai’don.
Birgitte’s braid swung as she shook her head. “I have not seen him for some time. I think the
Wheel has spun him out again. It always happens so.” Expectation and concern both touched her
voice.
If Birgitte was right, then somewhere in the world a boychild had been born, a mewling babe
with no knowledge of who he was, yet destined for adventures that would make new legends. The
Wheel wove the heroes into the Pattern as they were needed, to shape the Pattern, and when they died
they returned here to wait again. That was what it meant to be bound to the Wheel. New heroes could
find themselves bound so as well, men and women whose bravery and accomplishments raised them
far above the ordinary, but once bound, it was forever.
“How long do you have?” Nynaeve asked. “Years yet, surely.” Birgitte was always tied to
Gaidal, had been tied in story after story, in Age after Age, of adventure and a romance that even the
Wheel of Time did not break. She was always born after Gaidal; a year, or five, or ten, but after.
“I do not know, Nynaeve. Time here is not like time in the waking world. I met you here last ten
days gone, as it seems to me, and Elayne only a day before. What was it for you?”
“Four days and three,” Nynaeve muttered. She and Elayne had been coming to speak with
Birgitte as often as they could, though too frequently it had not been possible with Thom and Juilin
sharing the camp and standing night guard. Birgitte actually remembered the War of Power, one
lifetime of it anyway, and the Forsaken. Her past lives were like books fondly remembered from long
ago, the more distant dimmer than the nearer, but the Forsaken stood out. Especially Moghedien.
“You see, Nynaeve? The flow of time here can shift in larger ways, too. It might be months
before I am born again, or days. Here, for me. In the waking world it could be years yet before my

birth.”
With an effort Nynaeve suppressed her vexation. “Then we mustn’t waste what time we have.
Have you seen any of them since we last met?” There was no need to say who.
“Too many. Lanfear is often in Tel’aran’rhiod, of course, but I have seen Rahvin and Sammael
and Graendal. Demandred. And Semirhage.” Birgitte’s voice tightened at the last name; even
Moghedien, who hated her, did not frighten her visibly, but Semirhage was another matter.
Nynaeve shivered as well—the golden-haired woman had told her too much of that one—and
realized she was wearing a thick wool cloak, with a deep hood pulled up to hide her face; flushing,
she made it disappear.
“None of them have seen you?” she asked anxiously. Birgitte was more vulnerable than herself
in many ways, despite her knowledge of Tel’aran’rhiod. She had never been able to channel; any of
the Forsaken could destroy her as if crushing an ant, without breaking stride. And if she were
destroyed here, there would be no rebirth for her ever again.
“I am not so unskilled—or so foolish—as to allow that.” Birgitte leaned on her silver bow;
legend said she never missed with that bow and her silver arrows. “They are concerned with each
other, not anyone else. I have seen Rahvin and Sammael, Graendal and Lanfear, each stalking the
others unseen. And Demandred and Semirhage each shadowing them as well. I have not seen so much
of them here since they were freed.”
“They are up to something.” Nynaeve bit her lip in vexed frustration. “But what?”
“I cannot say yet, Nynaeve. In the War of the Shadow, they were always plotting, against each
other as often as not, but their work has never boded well for the world, waking or dreaming.”
“Try to find out, Birgitte; as much as you can safely, at any rate. Do not take any risks.” The
other woman’s face did not change, but Nynaeve thought she was amused; the fool woman thought as
little of danger as did Lan. She wished she could ask about the White Tower, about what Siuan might
be scheming, but Birgitte could neither see nor touch the waking world unless she was called there by
the Horn. You are just trying to avoid what you really want to ask! “Have you seen Moghedien?”
“No,” Birgitte sighed, “but not for lack of trying. In the usual course I can find anyone who
knows they are in the World of Dreams; there is a feel, like ripples spreading through the air from
them. Or perhaps from their awareness; I do not know, really. I am a soldier, not a scholar. Either she
has not come into Tel’aran’rhiod since you defeated her, or . . .” She hesitated, and Nynaeve wanted
to stop her from saying what she knew would come next, but Birgitte was too strong to dodge
unpalatable possibilities. “Or else she knows I have been looking for her. She can hide, that one. She
is not called the Spider for nothing.” That was what a moghedien had been, in the Age of Legends; a
tiny spider that spun its webs in secret places, its bite poisonous enough to kill in heartbeats.
Suddenly very much aware of feeling unseen eyes, Nynaeve shivered heavily. It was not
trembling. Just a shiver, not trembling. Still, she kept the sleek Taraboner gown firmly in mind lest
she abruptly find herself wearing armor. It was embarrassing enough if that sort of thing happened
when she was alone, even more under the cool blue gaze of a woman valiant enough to be a match for
Gaidal Cain.
“Can you find her even when she wants to remain hidden, Birgitte?” It was a very great deal to
ask, if Moghedien knew she was being hunted; like searching for a lion in high grass armed only with
a stick.
The other woman did not hesitate. “Perhaps. I will try.” Hefting her bow, she added, “I must go,
now. I do not want to risk being seen by the others when they come.”
Nynaeve put a hand on her arm to stop her. “It would be a help if you let me tell them. That way I

could share what you’ve told me about the Forsaken with Egwene and the Wise Ones, and they could
tell Rand. Birgitte, he needs to know—”
“You promised, Nynaeve.” Those bright blue eyes were unyielding as ice. “The prescripts say
that we must not let anyone know that we reside in Tel’aran’rhiod. I have broken many by speaking
to you, much more by giving aid, because I cannot stand by and watch you battle the Shadow—I have
fought that battle in more lifetimes than I can remember—but I will keep as many of the prescripts as I
can. You must hold to your promise.”
“Of course I will,” she said indignantly, “unless you release me from it. And I do ask you to—”
“No.”
And Birgitte was gone. One moment Nynaeve’s hand rested on a white coatsleeve, the next on
empty air. In her mind she ran through a few curses she had overheard from Thom and Juilin, the sort
she would have scolded Elayne for listening to, much less using. There was no point calling Birgitte’s
name again. She probably would not come. Nynaeve only hoped she responded the next time she or
Elayne called. “Birgitte! I will keep my promise, Birgitte!”
She would have heard that. Perhaps by their next meeting she would know something of
Moghedien’s activities. Nynaeve almost hoped she would not. If she did, it meant that Moghedien
really was stalking Tel’aran’rhiod.
Fool woman! “If you don’t look for snakes, you cannot complain when one bites you.” She
really did want to meet Elayne’s Lini one day.
The emptiness of the vast chamber oppressed her, all those great polished columns and that
sense of being watched from the dimness between. If there really was anybody there, Birgitte would
have known.
She realized that she was smoothing the silk gown over her hips, and, to take her mind off eyes
that were not there, she concentrated on the dress. It had been in good Two Rivers woolens that Lan
had first seen her, and a simple embroidered dress that she had been wearing when he professed his
love, but she wanted him to see her in gowns like this. It would not be indecent if he was the one
seeing her.
A tall standing mirror appeared, casting her reflection as she turned this way and that, even
peering back over her shoulder. The yellow folds sheathed her closely, suggesting everything they
hid. The Women’s Circle in Emond’s Field would have hauled her off for a good talking to in private,
Wisdom or no Wisdom. Yet it was quite beautiful. Here, alone, she could admit that she had a bit
more than gotten used to wearing something like this in public. You enjoyed it, she scolded herself.
You are every bit as much a hussy as Elayne seems to be turning into! But it was beautiful. And
maybe not as immodest as she had always said. Not a neckline cut halfway to her knees, like the First
of Mayene, for instance. Well, perhaps Berelain’s were not that low, but they were still far deeper
than respectability required.
She had heard about what Domani women often wore; even Taraboners called those indecent.
With the thought, the yellow silk folds became rippling flows, with a narrow belt of woven gold. And
thin. Her face colored. Very thin. Barely opaque at all, in fact. The gown certainly did more than
suggest. If Lan saw her in that, he would not gabble that his love for her was hopeless and that he
would not give her widow’s weeds for a bridal gift. One glimpse, and his blood would catch fire. He
would—
“What under the Light is that you have on, Nynaeve?” Egwene asked in scandalized tones.
Nynaeve leaped straight up, spinning, and when she came down facing Egwene and Melaine—it
would be Melaine, though none of the Wise Ones would have been any better—the mirror was gone

and she was wearing a dark woolen Two Rivers dress thick enough for the depths of winter.
Mortified at being startled as much as anything else—it was mainly at being startled—she changed the
dress instantly, without thinking, flashing back into the gossamer Domani and just as quickly to the
yellow Taraboner folds.
Her face flamed. They probably thought her a complete fool. And in front of Melaine, at that.
The Wise One was beautiful, with her long red-gold hair and clear green eyes. Not that she cared a
whit how the woman looked. But Melaine had been at her last meeting here with Egwene, too, and
taunted her about Lan. Nynaeve had lost her temper over it. Egwene claimed they were not taunts, not
among Aielwomen, but Melaine had complimented Lan’s shoulders, and his hands, and his eyes.
What right did that green-eyed cat have to look at Lan’s shoulders? Not that she had any doubts of his
faithfulness. But he was a man, and far away from her, and Melaine was right there, and . . . Firmly,
she put a stop to that line of reasoning.
“Is Lan—?” She thought her face was going to burn off. Can’t you control your own tongue,
woman? But she would not—could not—back away, not with Melaine there. Egwene’s bemused
smile was bad enough, but Melaine dared to put on a look of understanding. “Is he well?” She tried
for cool composure, but it came out strained.
“He is well,” Egwene said. “He worries about whether you are safe.”
Nynaeve let out a breath she had not realized she was holding. The Waste was a dangerous place
even without the likes of Couladin and the Shaido, and the man did not know the meaning of caution.
He was worried about her safety? Did the fool man think she could not take care of herself?
“We’ve finally reached Amadica,” she said quickly, hoping to cover herself. A flapping tongue,
and then sighs! The man has stolen my wits! There was no telling from the others’ faces whether she
was succeeding. “A village called Sienda, east of Amador. Whitecloaks everywhere, but they don’t
look at us twice. It is others we have to worry about.” In front of Melaine, she had to be careful—to
bend the truth a little, in fact, here and there—but she told them of Ronde Macura and her odd
message, and her trying to drug them. Trying, because she could not make herself admit in front of
Melaine that the woman had succeeded. Light, what am I doing? I’ve never lied to Egwene before in
my life!
The supposed reason—the return of a runaway Accepted—certainly could not be mentioned, not
in front of one of the Wise Ones. They thought that she and Elayne were full Aes Sedai. But she had to
let Egwene know the truth of that somehow. “It might have to do with some plot concerning Andor,
but Elayne and you and I have things in common, Egwene, and I think we should be just as careful as
Elayne.” The girl nodded slowly; she looked stunned, as well she might, but she seemed to
understand. “A good thing the taste of that tea made me suspicious. Imagine trying to feed forkroot to
someone who knows herbs as well as I do.”
“Schemes within schemes,” Melaine murmured. “The Great Serpent is a good sign for you Aes
Sedai, I think. Someday you may swallow yourselves by accident.”
“We have news ourselves,” Egwene said.
Nynaeve could see no reason for the girl’s haste. I am certainly not going to let the woman bait
me into losing my temper. And I certainly wouldn’t get angry over her insulting the Tower. She
took her hand away from her braid. What Egwene had to say put temper right out of her head.
Couladin crossing the Spine of the World was surely grave, and Rand following scarcely less
so; he was pushing hard for the Jangai Pass, marching from first light until after dusk, and Melaine
said they would soon reach it. Conditions in Cairhien were harsh enough without a war between Aiel
on its territory. And a new Aiel War to come, surely, if he tried to carry out his mad plan. Mad. Not

yet, surely. He had to hang on to sanity, somehow.
How long since I was worrying how to protect him? she thought bitterly. And now I just want
him to stay sane to fight the Last Battle. Not only for that reason, but for that one, too. He was what
he was. The Light burn me, I’m as bad as Siuan Sanche or any of them!
It was what Egwene had to say about Moiraine that shocked her. “She obeys him?” she said
incredulously.
Egwene gave a vigorous nod, in that ridiculous Aiel scarf. “Last night they had an argument—
she’s still trying to convince him not to cross the Dragonwall—and finally he told her to stand outside
until she cooled down; she looked about to swallow her tongue, but she did it. She stayed out in the
night for an hour, anyway.”
“It is not proper,” Melaine said, resettling her shawl firmly. “Men have no more business
ordering Aes Sedai about than they do Wise Ones. Even the Car’a’carn.”
“They certainly do not,” Nynaeve agreed, then had to clamp her mouth shut to keep from gaping
at herself. What do I care if he makes her dance to his tune? She has made all of us dance to hers
often enough. But it was not proper. I do not want to be Aes Sedai, just to learn more about
Healing. I want to stay who I am. Let him order her about! Still, it was not proper.
“At least he talks with her, now,” Egwene said. “Before, he turned to acid if she came within ten
feet of him. Nynaeve, his head swells bigger every day.”
“Back when I thought you’d follow me as Wisdom,” Nynaeve told her wryly, “I taught you how
to take swelling down. Best for him if you do it, even if he has turned into the king bull in the pasture.
Maybe most because he is. It seems to me that kings—and queens—can be fools when they forget
what they are and act like who they are, but they’re worse when they only remember what they are
and forget who. Most could do with someone whose only job is to remind them that they eat and
sweat and cry the same as any farmer.”
Melaine folded her shawl around her, seeming unsure whether to agree or not, but Egwene said,
“I try, but sometimes he doesn’t seem like himself at all, and even when he is, his arrogance is usually
too thick a bubble to prick.”
“Do the best you can. Helping him hold on to himself may be the best thing that anyone could do.
For him, and the rest of the world.”
That produced a silence. She and Egwene certainly did not like to talk about the eventuality of
Rand going mad, and Melaine could not like it any better.
“I have something else important to tell you,” she went on after a moment. “I think the Forsaken
are planning something.” It was not the same as telling them about Birgitte. She made it seem that she
herself had seen Lanfear and the others. In truth, Moghedien was the only one she could recognize at
sight, and maybe Asmodean, though she had only seen him once, and at a distance. She hoped neither
of them thought to ask how she knew who was who, or why she thought Moghedien might be skulking
about. In actuality, the problem did not arise from that at all.
“Have you been wandering the World of Dreams?” Melaine’s eyes were green ice.
Nynaeve met her level stare for level stare, despite Egwene’s rueful head-shaking. “I could
hardly see Rahvin and the rest without it, now could I?”
“Aes Sedai, you know little, and you try too much. You should not have been taught the few
pieces that you have. For myself, I sometimes regret that we agreed even to these meetings.
Unschooled women should not be allowed in Tel’aran’rhiod.”
“I have schooled myself in more than you ever taught me.” Nynaeve kept her voice cool with an
effort. “I learned to channel on my own, and I do not see why Tel’aran’rhiod should be any

different.” It was only stubborn anger that made her say that. She had taught herself to channel, true,
but without knowing what it was that she was doing and only after a fashion. Before the White Tower,
she had Healed sometimes, but unaware, until Moiraine proved it to her. Her teachers in the Tower
had said that was why she needed to be angry in order to channel; she had hidden her ability from
herself, afraid of it, and only fury could break through that long-buried fear.
“So you are one of those the Aes Sedai call wilders.” There was a hint of something in the last
word, but whether scorn or pity, Nynaeve did not like it. The term was seldom complimentary, in the
Tower. Of course, there were no wilders among the Aiel. The Wise Ones who could channel found
every last girl with the spark born in her, those who would develop the ability to channel sooner or
later even if they did not try to learn. They claimed also to find every girl without the spark who
could learn if instructed. No Aiel girl died trying to learn by herself. “You know the dangers of
learning the Power without guidance, Aes Sedai. Do not think the dangers of the dream are less. They
are just as great, perhaps more for those who venture without knowledge.”
“I am careful,” Nynaeve said in a tight voice. She had not come to be lectured by this sun-haired
vixen of an Aiel. “I know what I am doing, Melaine.”
“You know nothing. You are as headstrong as this one was when she came to us.” The Wise One
gave Egwene a smile that actually seemed affectionate. “We tamed her excessive exuberance, and
now she learns swiftly. Though she does have many faults, still.” Egwene’s pleased grin faded;
Nynaeve suspected that grin was why Melaine had added the last. “If you wish to wander the dream,”
the Aiel woman went on, “come to us. We will tame your zeal, as well, and teach you.”
“I do not need taming, thank you very much,” Nynaeve said with a polite smile.
“Aan’allein will die on the day he learns that you are dead.”
Ice stabbed into Nynaeve’s heart. Aan’allein was what the Aiel called Lan. One Man, it meant in
the Old Tongue, or Man Alone, or the Man Who Is an Entire People; exact translations from the Old
Tongue were often difficult. The Aiel had a great deal of respect for Lan, the man who would not give
up his war with the Shadow, the enemy that had destroyed his nation. “You are a dirty fighter,” she
muttered.
Melaine quirked an eyebrow. “Do we fight? If we do, then know that in battle there is only
winning and losing. Rules against hurting are for games. I want your promise that you will do nothing
in the dream without first asking one of us. I know Aes Sedai cannot lie, so I would hear you say it.”
Nynaeve gritted her teeth. The words would be easy to say. She did not have to hold to them; she
was not bound by the Three Oaths. But it would be admitting that Melaine was right. She did not
believe it, and she would not say it.
“She’ll not promise, Melaine,” Egwene said finally. “When she gets that muley look, she
wouldn’t come out of the house if you showed her the roof on fire.”
Nynaeve spared a piece of glare for her. Muley, indeed! When all she did was refuse to be
pushed about like a rag doll.
After a long moment, Melaine sighed. “Very well. But it would be well to remember, Aes Sedai,
that you are but a child in Tel’aran’rhiod. Come, Egwene. We must go.” An amused wince crossed
Egwene’s face as the two faded away.
Abruptly Nynaeve realized that her clothes had changed. Had been changed; the Wise Ones
knew enough of Tel’aran’rhiod to alter things about others as well as themselves. She wore a white
blouse and a dark skirt, but unlike those of the women who had just gone, this stopped well short of
her knees. Her shoes and stockings were gone, and her hair was divided into two braids, one over
each ear, woven with yellow ribbons. A rag doll with a carved and painted face sat beside her bare

feet. She could hear her teeth grinding. This had happened once before, and she had pried out of
Egwene that this was how the Aiel dressed little girls.
In a fury she switched back to the yellow Tarabbner silk—this time it adhered even more closely
—and kicked the doll. It sailed away, vanishing in midair. That Melaine probably had her eye on Lan;
the Aiel all seemed to think he was some sort of hero. The high neck became a tall lace collar, and the
deep narrow neckline showed her cleavage. If that woman so much as smiled at him . . . ! If he . . . !
Suddenly she became aware of her fast-sinking, rapidly widening neckline and hastily brought it back
up; not all the way, but enough that she did not have to blush. The dress had grown so tight that she
could not move; she took care of that, too.
So she was supposed to ask permission, was she? Go begging the Wise Ones before doing
anything? Had she not defeated Moghedien? They had been properly impressed at the time, but they
seemed to have forgotten.
If she could not use Birgitte to find out what was going on in the Tower, perhaps there was a
way she could do it herself.

CHAPTER
15

What Can Be Learned in Dreams

Carefully Nynaeve formed an image in her mind of the Amyrlin’s study, just as she had
envisioned the Heart of the Stone on going to sleep. Nothing happened, and she frowned. She should
have been taken to the White Tower, to the room she had visualized. Trying again, she imagined a
room there that she had visited much more often, if more unhappily.
The Heart of the Stone became the study of the Mistress of Novices, a compact, dark-paneled
room full of plain, sturdy furnishings that had been used by generations of women who had held that
office. When a novice’s transgressions were such that extra hours of scrubbing floors or raking paths
would not atone, it was here that she was sent. For an Accepted to receive that summons took a
greater transgression, but still she went, on leaden feet, knowing the outcome would be just as painful,
perhaps more so.
Nynaeve did not want to look at the room—Sheriam had called her willfully stubborn on her
numerous visits—but found herself staring into the mirror on the wall, where novices and Accepted
had to look at their own weeping faces while listening to Sheriam lecture about obeying the rules or
showing proper respect or whatever. Obeying others’ rules and showing required respect had always
tripped up Nynaeve. The faint remnants of gilt on the carved frame said it had been there since the
War of the Hundred Years, if not the Breaking.
The Taraboner dress was beautiful, but anyone who saw her in it would be suspicious. Even
Domani women usually dressed circumspectly when they visited the Tower, and she could not
imagine anybody dreaming of herself in the Tower except on her best behavior. Not that she was
likely to meet anyone, except perhaps someone who had dreamed herself into Tel’aran’rhiod for a
few moments; before Egwene, there had not been a woman in the Tower who could enter the World
of Dreams unaided since Corianin Nedeal, over four hundred years ago. On the other hand, among the
ter’angreal stolen from the Tower that were still in the hands of Liandrin and her confederates,
eleven had last been studied by Corianin. The two others of Corianin’s study, the two that she and
Elayne had in hand, both gave access to Tel’aran’rhiod; it was best to assume that the rest did, too.
There was small chance that Liandrin or any of the others would dream themselves back to the Tower
they had fled, but even that chance was too big to risk when it might mean being waylaid. For that
matter, she could not really be sure that the stolen ter’angreal were all that Corianin had investigated.
The records were often murky about ter’angreal no one understood, and others could very well be in
the hands of Black sisters still in the Tower.
The dress changed completely, became white wool, soft but not of a particularly fine quality,
and banded at the hem with seven colored stripes, one for each Ajah. If she saw anyone who did not
vanish after a few moments, she would take herself back to Sienda, and they would think she was only

one of the Accepted, touching Tel’aran’rhiod in her dreams. No. Not the inn, but Sheriam’s study.
Anyone like that would have to be Black Ajah, and after all, she was supposed to be hunting them.
Completing her disguise, she gripped her suddenly red-gold braid and grimaced at Melaine’s
face in the mirror. Now, there was a woman she would like to hand over to Sheriam.
The study of the Mistress of Novices was near the novices’ quarters, and the wide, tiled
hallways flickered with occasional motion past elaborate wall hangings and unlit stand-lamps;
flashes of frightened girls all in novice white. A good many novice nightmares would contain
Sheriam. She ignored them as she hurried by; they were not in the World of Dreams long enough to
see her, or if they did they would simply think her part of their own dream.
It was only a short climb up broad stairs to the Amyrlin’s study. As she approached, suddenly
Elaida was in front of her, sweaty-faced in a blood-red gown, the stole of the Amyrlin Seat around
her shoulders. Or almost the Amyrlin’s stole; it had no blue stripe.
Those stern dark eyes focused on Nynaeve. “I am the Amyrlin Seat, girl! Do you not know how
to show respect? I will have yo—” In midword, she was gone.
Nynaeve exhaled raggedly. Elaida as Amyrlin; that was a nightmare for certain. Probably her
fondest dream, she thought wryly. It will snow in Tear before she ever rises that high.
The anteroom was much as she remembered it, with one wide table and a chair behind it for the
Keeper of the Chronicles. A few chairs sat against the wall for Aes Sedai waiting to speak with the
Amyrlin; novices and Accepted stood. The neat array of papers on the table, bound scrolls and large
parchments with seals and letters, seemed unlike Leane, though. Not that she was untidy, quite the
reverse, yet Nynaeve had always thought she would put everything away at night.
She pushed open the door to the inner room, but her step slowed as she entered. No wonder she
had not been able to dream herself here; the room was nothing like what she remembered. That
heavily carved table and tall, thronelike chair. The vine-carved stools arranged in a perfect curve in
front of the table, not one so much as an inch out of place. Siuan Sanche affected simple furnishings,
as if pretending she was still only a fisherman’s daughter, and she kept only one extra chair, which
she did not always let visitors use. And that white vase full of red roses, rigidly arranged on a
pedestal like a monument. Siuan enjoyed flowers, but she preferred a bouquet of colors, like a field
of wildflowers in miniature. Above the fireplace had hung a simple drawing of fishing boats in tall
reeds. Now there were two paintings, one of which Nynaeve recognized. Rand, battling the Forsaken
who had called himself Ba’alzamon, in the clouds above Falme. The other, on three wooden panels,
portrayed scenes that linked to nothing she could pull out of her memory.
The door opened, and Nynaeve’s heart leaped into her throat. A red-haired Accepted she had
never seen before stepped into the room and stared at her. She did not wink out of existence. Just as
Nynaeve was preparing to leap back to Sheriam’s study, the red-haired woman said, “Nynaeve, if
Melaine knew you were using her face, she’d do more than put you in a child’s dress.” And just that
suddenly she was Egwene, in her Aiel garb.
“You nearly frightened ten years out of me,” Nynaeve muttered. “So the Wise Ones have finally
decided to let you come and go as you please? Or is Melaine behind—”
“You should be frightened,” Egwene snapped, color rising in her cheeks. “You are a fool,
Nynaeve. A child playing in the barn with a candle.”
Nynaeve gaped. Egwene berating her? “You listen to me, Egwene al’Vere. I’ll not take that from
Melaine, and I won’t take it—”
“You had best take it from someone, before you get yourself killed.”
“I—”

“I ought to take that stone ring away from you. I should have given it to Elayne and told her not to
let you use it at all.”
“Told her not—!”
“Do you think Melaine was exaggerating?” Egwene said sternly, shaking her finger almost
exactly like Melaine. “She was not, Nynaeve. The Wise Ones have told you the simple truth about
Tel’aran’rhiod time and again, but you seem to think they’re fools whistling in a high wind. You are
supposed to be a grown woman, not a silly little child. I vow, whatever sense you once had in your
head seems to have vanished like a puff of smoke. Well, find it, Nynaeve!” She sniffed loudly,
rearranging the shawl on her shoulders. “Right now you are trying to play with the pretty flames in the
fireplace, too foolish to realize you might fall in.”
Nynaeve stared in amazement. They argued often enough, but Egwene had never ever tried to
dress her down like a girl caught with her fingers in the honey jar. Never! The dress. It was the
Accepted’s dress she was wearing, and someone else’s face. She changed herself back to herself, in a
good blue wool that she had often worn for Circle meetings and to put the Council straight. She felt
robed in all her old authority as Wisdom. “I am well aware of how much I don’t know,” she said
levelly, “but those Aiel—”
“Do you realize you could dream yourself into something you could not get out of? Dreams are
real here. If you let yourself drift into a fond dream, it could trap you. You’d trap yourself. Until you
died.”
“Will you—?”
“There are nightmares walking Tel’aran’rhiod, Nynaeve.”
“Will you let me speak?” Nyaneve barked. Or rather, she tried to bark it; there was rather too
much frustrated pleading in there to suit her. Any at all would have been too much.
“No, I will not,” Egwene said firmly. “Not until you want to say something worth listening to. I
said nightmares, and I meant nightmares, Nynaeve. When someone has a nightmare while in
Tel’aran’rhiod, it is real, too. And sometimes it survives after the dreamer has gone. You just don’t
realize, do you?”
Suddenly rough hands enveloped Nynaeve’s arms. Her head whipped from side to side, eyes
bulging. Two huge, ragged men lifted her into the air, faces half-melted ruins of coarse flesh, drooling
mouths full of sharp, yellowed teeth. She tried to make them vanish—if a Wise One dreamwalker
could, so could she—and one of them ripped her dress open down the front like parchment. The other
seized her chin in a horny, callused hand and twisted her face toward him; his head bent toward her,
mouth opening. Whether to kiss or bite, she did not know, but she would rather die than allow either.
She flailed for saidar and found nothing; it was horror filling her, not anger. Thick fingernails dug
into her cheeks, holding her head steady. Egwene had done this, somehow. Egwene. “Please,
Egwene!” It was a squeal, and she was too terrified to care. “Please!”
The men—creatures—vanished, and her feet thudded to the floor. For a moment all she could do
was shudder and weep. Hastily she repaired the damage to her dress, but the scratches from long
fingernails remained on her neck and chest. Clothing could be mended easily in Tel’aran’rhiod, but
whatever happened to a human . . . Her knees shook so badly that it was all she could do to stay
upright.
She half-expected Egwene to comfort her, and for once she would have accepted it gladly. But
the other woman only said, “There are worse things here, but nightmares are bad enough. I made
these, and unmade them, but even I have trouble with those I just find. And I did not try to hold them,
Nynaeve. If you knew how to unmake them, you could have.”

Nynaeve tossed her head angrily, refusing to scrub the tears from her cheeks. “I could have
dreamed myself away. To Sheriam’s study, or back to my bed.” She did not sound sulky. Of course
she did not.
“If you had not been too scared spitless to think of it,” Egwene said dryly. “Oh, take that sullen
look off your face. It looks silly on you.”
She glared at the other woman, but it did not work as it usually did. Instead of flaring into
argument, Egwene merely arched an eyebrow at her. “None of this looks like Siuan Sanche,” Nynaeve
said to change the subject. What had gotten into the girl?
“It doesn’t,” Egwene agreed, looking around the room. “I see why I had to come by way of my
old room in the novices’ quarters. But I suppose people do decide to try something new sometimes.”
“That is what I mean,” Nynaeve told her patiently. She had not sounded sulky, and she had not
looked sullen. It was ridiculous. “The woman who furnished this room doesn’t look at the world the
same as the woman who chose what used to be here. Look at those paintings. I don’t know what the
triple thing is, but you can recognize the other as well as I.” They had both seen it happen.
“Bonwhin, I should say,” Egwene said thoughtfully. “You never did listen to the lectures as you
should. It is a triptych.”
“Whatever it is, it’s the other that’s important.” She had listened to the Yellows well enough.
The rest was a pack of useless nonsense often as not. “It seems to me that the woman who hung it
wants to be reminded how dangerous Rand is. If Siuan Sanche has turned against Rand for some
reason . . . Egwene, this could be far worse than just her wanting Elayne back in the Tower.”
“Perhaps,” Egwene said judiciously. “Maybe the papers will tell us something. You search in
here. When I finish with Leane’s desk, I will help you.”
Nynaeve stared indignantly at Egwene’s back as she left. You search in here, indeed! Egwene
had no right to give her orders. She ought to march right after her and tell her so in no uncertain terms.
Then why are you standing here like a lump? she asked herself angrily. Searching the papers was a
good idea, and she might as well do so in here as out there. In fact, the Amyrlin’s desk was more
likely to hold something important. Grumbling to herself about what she would do to set Egwene
straight, she stalked to the thickly carved table, kicking her skirts with every step.
There was nothing on the table except three ornately lacquered boxes, arrayed with painful
precision. Remembering the sorts of traps that could be set by someone wanting to insure privacy, she
made a long stick to push open the hinged lid of the first, a gold and green thing decorated with
wading herons. It was a writing case, with pens and ink and sand. The largest box, with red roses
twining through golden scrolls, held twenty or more delicate carvings of ivory and turquoise, animals
and people, all laid out on pale gray velvet.
As she pushed up the lid of the third box—golden hawks fighting among white clouds in a blue
sky—she noticed that the first two were closed again. Things like that happened here; everything
seemed to want to remain as it was in the waking world, and on top of that, if you took your eyes
away for a moment, details could be different when you looked back.
The third box did hold documents. The stick vanished, and she gingerly lifted out the top sheet of
parchment. Formally signed “Joline Aes Sedai,” it was a humble request to serve a set of penances
that made Nynaeve wince just scanning them rapidly. Nothing there that mattered, except to Joline. A
scrawl at the bottom said “approved” in angular script. As she reached to put the parchment down, it
faded away; the box was closed, too.
Sighing, she opened it again. The papers inside looked different. Holding the lid, she lifted them
out one by one and read quickly. Or tried to read. Sometimes the letters and reports vanished while

she was still picking them up, sometimes when she was no more than halfway down a page. If they
had a salutation, it was simply, “Mother, with respect.” Some were signed by Aes Sedai, others by
women with other titles, nobles, or no honorific at all. None of it seemed to bear on the matter at
hand. The Marshal General of Saldaea and his army could not be found, and Queen Tenobia was
refusing to cooperate; she managed to finish that report, but it assumed that the reader knew why the
man was not in Saldaea and what the queen was supposed to be cooperating about. No report had
come from any Ajah’s eyes-and-ears in Tanchico for three weeks; but she got no further than that one
fact. Some trouble between Illian on one side and Murandy on the other was abating, and Pedron
Niall was claiming credit; even in the few lines she got she could see the writer’s teeth gnashing. The
letters were all no doubt very important, those she was able to hurry through and those that faded
away under her eyes, but of no use to her at all. She had just begun what seemed to be a report on a
suspected—that was the word used—gathering of Blue sisters, when a wretched cry of “Oh, Light,
no!” came from the outer room.
Darting for the door, she made a stout wooden club appear in her hands, its head bristling with
spikes. But when she dashed in expecting to find Egwene defending herself, the woman was standing
behind the Keeper’s table staring at nothing. With a look of horror on her face, to be sure, but still
unharmed and unthreatened that Nynaeve could see.
Egwene gave a start at the sight of her, then gathered herself visibly. “Nynaeve, Elaida is
Amyrlin Seat.”
“Don’t be a goose,” Nynaeve scoffed. Yet the other room, so unlike Siuan Sanche . . . “You’re
imagining things. You must be.”
“I had a parchment in my hands, Nynaeve, signed ‘Elaida do Avriny a’Roihan, Watcher of the
Seals, Flame of Tar Valon, The Amyrlin Seat,’ and sealed with the Amyrlin’s seal.”
Nynaeve’s stomach tried to flutter up into her chest. “But how? What has happened to Siuan?
Egwene, the Tower doesn’t depose an Amyrlin except for something serious. Only two in nearly three
thousand years.”
“Maybe Rand was serious enough.” Egwene’s voice was steady, though her eyes were still too
wide. “Maybe she became ill with something the Yellows couldn’t Heal, or fell down the stairs and
broke her neck. What matters is that Elaida is Amyrlin. I don’t think she will support Rand as Siuan
did.”
“Moiraine,” Nynaeve muttered. “So sure that Siuan would put the Tower behind him.” She could
not imagine Siuan Sanche dead. She had hated the woman often, been the slightest bit afraid of her on
occasion—she could admit that now, to herself anyway—yet she had respected her, too. She had
thought that Siuan would last forever. “Elaida. Light! She’s as mean as a snake and as cruel as a cat.
There’s no telling what she might do.”
“I am afraid I have a clue.” Egwene pressed both hands to her stomach as though to quell flutters
of her own. “It was a very short document. I managed to read it all. ‘All loyal sisters are required to
report the presence of the woman Moiraine Damodred. She is to be detained if possible, by whatever
means are necessary, and returned to the White Tower for trial on charge of treason.’ The same sort
of language that was apparently used about Elayne.”
“If Elaida wants Moiraine arrested, it must mean she knows Moiraine has been helping Rand,
and she does not like it.” Talking was good. Talking kept her from sicking up. Treason. They stilled
women for that. She had wanted to bring Moiraine down. Now Elaida was going to do it for her. “She
certainly won’t support Rand.”
“Exactly.”

“Loyal sisters. Egwene, that fits with the Macura woman’s message. Whatever happened to
Siuan, the Ajahs have split over Elaida as Amyrlin. It must be.”
“Yes, of course. Very good, Nynaeve. I did not see that.”
Her smile was so pleased that Nynaeve smiled back. “There’s a report on Siu—on the
Amyrlin’s writing table about a gathering of Blues. I was just reading it when you shouted. I’ll wager
the Blues didn’t support Elaida.” The Blue and Red Ajahs had a sort of armed truce at the best of
times, and came near going for each other’s throats at the worst.
But when they went back into the inner room, the report was not to be found. There were plenty
of documents—Joline’s letter had reappeared; a brief reading made Egwene’s eyebrows climb nearly
to her hair—but not the one that they wanted.
“Can you remember what it said?” Egwene asked.
“I had just gotten a few lines when you shouted, and . . . I just can’t remember.”
“Try, Nynaeve. Try very hard.”
“I am, Egwene, but it will not come. I am trying.”
What she was doing hit Nynaeve like a sudden hammer between the eyes. Excusing herself. To
Egwene, a girl whose bottom she had switched for throwing a tantrum not more than two years ago.
And a moment earlier she had been proud as a hen with a new egg because Egwene was pleased with
her. She remembered quite clearly the day when the balance between them had shifted, when they
ceased being the Wisdom and the girl who fetched when the Wisdom said fetch, becoming instead just
two women far from home. It seemed that balance had shifted further, and she did not like it. She was
going to have to do something to move it back where it belonged.
The lie. She had deliberately lied to Egwene for the first time ever today. That was why her
moral authority had vanished, why she was floundering around, unable to assert herself properly. “I
drank the tea, Egwene.” She forced each word deliberately. She had to force them. “The Macura
woman’s forkroot tea. She and Luci hauled us upstairs like sacks of feathers. That is about how much
strength we had between us. If Thom and Juilin hadn’t come to pull us out by the scruffs of our necks,
we would probably be there still. Or else on our way to the Tower, so full of forkroot we wouldn’t
wake up until we got here.” Taking a deep breath, she tried for a tone of righteous firmness, but it was
difficult when you had just confessed to having been an utter fool. What came out sounded much more
tentative than she liked. “If you tell the Wise Ones about this—especially that Melaine—I’ll box your
ears.”
Something in that should have sparked Egwene’s ire. It seemed odd to want to start a row—
usually their quarrels were over Egwene refusing to see reason, and they seldom ended pleasantly,
since the girl had formed the habit of continuing to refuse—but that was certainly better than this. Yet
Egwene only smiled at her. An amused smile. A condescending amused smile.
“I more than suspected as much, Nynaeve. You used to drone on about herbs day and night, but
you never mentioned any plant called forkroot. I was sure you’d never heard of it until that woman
mentioned it. You’ve always tried to put the best face on things. If you fell head first into a pigsty,
you’d try to convince everybody you did it on purpose. Now, what we have to decide—”
“I do no such thing,” Nynaeve spluttered.
“You certainly do. Facts are facts. You might as well stop whining about it and help me decide
—”
Whining! This was not going at all the way she wanted. “They are no such thing. Not facts, I
mean. I have never done what you said.”
For a moment Egwene stared at her silently. “You will not let go of this, will you? Very well.

You lied to me . . .”
“It was not a lie,” she muttered. “Not exactly.”
The other woman ignored her interruption. “. . . And you lie to yourself. Do you remember what
you made me drink the last time I lied to you?” Suddenly a cup was in her hand, full of viscous sickly
green liquid; it looked as if it had been scooped from a scummy stagnant pond. “The only time I ever
lied to you. The memory of that taste was an effective discouragement. If you cannot tell the truth even
to yourself . . .”
Nynaeve took a step back before she could stop herself. Boiled catfern and powdered
mavinsleaf; her tongue writhed at just the thought. “I did not really lie, actually.” Why was she
making excuses? “I just didn’t tell the whole truth.” I am the Wisdom! I was the Wisdom; that ought
to count for something still. “You cannot really think . . .” Just tell her. You’re not the child here,
and you certainly are not going to drink. “Egwene, I—” Egwene pushed the cup nearly under her
nose; she could smell the acrid tang. “All right,” she said hastily. This can’t be happening! But she
could not take her eyes off that brimming cup, and she could not stop the words tumbling out.
“Sometimes I try to make things look better for myself than they were. Sometimes. But never anything
important. I’ve never—lied—about anything important. Never, I swear. Only small things.” The cup
vanished, and Nynaeve heaved a sigh of relief. Fool, fool woman! She couldn’t have made you drink
it! What is wrong with you?
“What we have to decide,” Egwene said as if nothing at all had happened, “is who to tell.
Moiraine certainly has to know, and Rand, but if everyone hears of it . . . The Aiel are peculiar, about
Aes Sedai no less than anything else. I think they’ll follow Rand as He Who Comes With the Dawn in
spite of anything, but once they learn the White Tower is against him, maybe they won’t be so
fervent.”
“They’ll learn sooner or later,” Nynaeve muttered. She could not have made me drink it!
“Later better than sooner, Nynaeve. So don’t you go bursting out in a temper and telling the Wise
Ones about this at our next meeting. In fact, it would be best if you didn’t mention this visit to the
Tower at all. That way maybe you can keep it secret.”
“I am not a fool,” Nynaeve said stiffly, and felt a slow burn when Egwene quirked that eyebrow
at her again. She was not about to bring the visit up with the Wise Ones. Not because it was easier
defying them behind their backs. Nothing like that. And she was not trying to put a good face on
things. It was not fair that Egwene could leap about Tel’aran’rhiod however she wanted, while she
had to put up with lectures and bullying.
“I know you are not,” Egwene said. “Unless you let your temper get the better of you. You need
to hold your temper and keep your wits about you if you’re right about the Forsaken, especially
Moghedien.” Nynaeve glowered at her, opening her mouth to say that she could too keep her temper
and she would smack Egwene’s ears if she thought differently, but the other woman gave her no
chance. “We must find that gathering of Blue sisters, Nynaeve. If they oppose Elaida, maybe—just
maybe—they will support Rand the way Siuan did. Was a town mentioned, or a village? A country,
even?”
“I think . . . I cannot remember.” She struggled to take the defensive note out of her voice. Light,
I confessed everything, made a fool of myself, and it’s only made things worse! “I will keep trying.”
“Good. We must find them, Nynaeve.” For a moment Egwene studied her, while she refused to
repeat herself. “Nynaeve, take care concerning Moghedien. Do not go rushing off like a bear in spring
just because she got away from you in Tanchico.”
“I am not a fool, Egwene,” Nynaeve said carefully. It was frustrating having to hold her temper,

but if all Egwene would do was ignore it or scold her, there was nothing to be gained beyond looking
a bigger ninny-head than she did already.
“I know. You said that. Just be sure you remember it. Be careful.” Egwene did not fade away
this time; she vanished, as suddenly as Birgitte.
Nynaeve stared at the spot where she had been, running through her head all the things she should
have said. Finally she realized that she could stand there all night; she was repeating herself, and the
time for saying anything was past. Grumbling under her breath, she stepped out of Tel’aran’rhiod,
back to her bed in Sienda.
Egwene’s eyes popped open in near total darkness, broken only by a little moonlight streaming
in through the smoke hole. She was glad to be under a pile of blankets; the fire was out, and freezing
cold filled the tent. Her breath turned to mist in front of her face. Without raising her head, she
scanned the interior. No Wise Ones. She was still alone.
That was her biggest fear on these solitary excursions into Tel’aran’rhiod: returning to find
Amys or one of the others waiting for her. Well, maybe not her biggest fear—the dangers in the World
of Dreams were every bit as great as she had told Nynaeve—but a big one nonetheless. It was not
punishment that frightened her, not the sort that Bair doled out. Had she wakened to find a Wise One
staring at her, she would have accepted such gladly, but Amys had told her near the beginning that if
she entered Tel’aran’rhiod without one of them accompanying her, they would send her away, refuse
to teach her any longer. That made her quail far more than anything else they could do. But even so,
she had to push ahead. As rapidly as they taught, they were not rapid enough. She wanted to know
now, to know everything.
Channeling, she lit her lamp and put flames in the firepit; nothing remained for them to burn, but
she tied the weave off. She lay there, watching her breath mist in front of her mouth, and waited for
warmth enough to dress. It was late, but perhaps Moiraine would still be awake.
What had happened with Nynaeve still amazed her. I think she’d actually have drunk, if I had
pressed her. She had been so afraid that Nynaeve would learn that she certainly did not have the
Wise Ones’ permission to jaunt about in the World of Dreams alone, so sure that the flush of
embarrassment had given her away, that all she could think of was keeping Nynaeve from speaking,
keeping her from winkling out the truth. And she had been so sure that Nynaeve would find out
anyway—the woman was quite capable of turning her in and saying it was for her own good—that all
she could do was talk, try to keep the focus on whatever Nynaeve was doing wrong. No matter how
angry Nynaeve made her, she could not seem to bring up a shout. And with all of that, somehow, she
had gained the upper hand.
Come to think of it, Moiraine seldom raised her voice, and when she did she was least effective
in having what she wanted done. It had been so even before she began behaving so strangely with
Rand. The Wise Ones never yelled at anyone, either—except each other, sometimes—and for all their
grumping about the chiefs no longer listening, they still seemed to get their way much more often than
not. There was an old saying that she had never really understood before: “He strains to hear a
whisper who refuses to hear a shout.” She would not shout at Rand again. A quiet, firm, womanly
voice, that was the thing. For that matter, she ought not to shout at Nynaeve, either; she was a woman,
not a girl throwing tantrums.
She found herself giggling. She especially ought not to raise her voice with Nynaeve when
speaking calmly produced such results.
The tent finally seemed warm enough, and she scampered out, dressing quickly. She still had to

break ice in her water pitcher before she could wash the sleep out of her mouth. Tossing the dark
woolen cloak about her shoulders, she untied the strands of Fire—Fire by itself was dangerous to
leave tied—and as the flames vanished, ducked out of the tent. Cold closed on her like an icy vise as
she hurried through the camp.
Only the nearest tents were really visible to her, low, shadowed shapes that could have been
part of the rugged earth, save that the camp extended for miles into the mountainous land to either
side. These tall jagged peaks were not the Spine of the World; that was much higher, and lay days to
the west yet.
She approached Rand’s tent hesitantly. A sliver of light showed along the tent flap. A Maiden
seemed to rise out of the ground as she came closer, horn bow on her back, quiver at her waist, and
spears and buckler in hand. Egwene could not make out any others in the darkness, but she knew they
were there, even here surrounded by six clans all claiming loyalty to the Car’a’carn. The Miagoma
were somewhere to the north, paralleling their march; Timolan would not say what his intentions
were. Where the other clans were, Rand did not seem to care. His attention was all on the race for
Jangai Pass.
“Is he awake, Enaila?” she asked.
Moonshadows shifted on the Maiden’s face as she nodded. “He does not sleep enough. A man
cannot go without rest.” She sounded for all the world like a mother fretting over her son.
A shadow beside the tent stirred, became Aviendha with her shawl wrapped around her. She did
not seem to feel the cool, only the hour. “I would sing him a lullaby, if I thought it might work. I have
heard of women being kept awake all night by an infant, but a grown man should know that others
would like to have their blankets.” She and Enaila shared a quiet chuckle.
Shaking her head over Aiel strangeness, Egwene bent to peer through the crack. Several lamps
lit the interior. He was not alone. Natael’s dark eyes looked haggard, and he stifled a yawn. He at
least wanted sleep. Rand lay sprawled close by one of the gilded oil lamps, reading a battered
leather-bound book. One translation or another of the Prophecies of the Dragon, if she knew him at
all.
Abruptly he flipped back through the pages, read, then laughed. She tried to tell herself there was
nothing of madness in that laugh, only bitterness. “A fine joke,” he told Natael, snapping the book shut
and tossing it to him. “Read page two hundred eighty-seven and page four hundred, and tell me if you
don’t agree.”
Egwene’s mouth tightened as she straightened. He really should be more careful with a book.
She could not speak to him, not in front of the gleeman. It was a shame that he had to use a man he
barely knew for company. No. He had Aviendha, and the chiefs often enough, and Lan every day, and
Mat sometimes. “Why don’t you join them, Aviendha? If you were there, maybe he’d want to talk of
something besides that book.”
“He wanted to talk with the gleeman, Egwene, and he seldom does that in front of me or anyone.
Had I not left, he and Natael would have.”
“Children are a great worry, I have heard.” Enaila laughed. “And sons the worst. You may find
out the truth of this for me, now that you have given up the spear.” Aviendha gave her a moonlit frown
and stalked back to her place against the side of the tent like an offended cat. Enaila seemed to think
that funny, too; she clutched her sides laughing.
Muttering to herself about Aiel humor—she almost never understood it—Egwene made her way
to Moiraine’s tent, not far from Rand’s. Here, too, there was a sliver of light, and she knew that the
Aes Sedai was awake. Moiraine was channeling; only tiny amounts of the Power, but still enough for

Egwene to sense. Lan lay sleeping nearby, wrapped in his Warder’s cloak; except for his head and
boots, the rest of him seemed part of the night. Gathering her cloak, she held her skirts up and tiptoed
so as not to wake him.
His breathing did not change, but something made her look at him again. Moonlight glinted on his
eyes, open and watching her. Even as she turned her head, they closed again. Not another muscle
stirred; he might never have wakened at all. Sometimes the man unnerved her. Whatever Nynaeve
saw in him, she could not see.
Kneeling beside the tent flap, she peered in. Moiraine sat surrounded by the glow of saidar, the
small blue stone that usually hung on her forehead dangling from her fingers in front of her face. It
shone, adding a bit to the light of a single lamp. The firepit held only ashes; even the smell was gone.
“May I come in?”
She had to repeat herself before Moiraine answered. “Of course.” The light ofsaidar faded
away, and the Aes Sedai began fastening the fine golden chain back into her hair.
“You were eavesdropping on Rand?” Egwene settled herself beside the other woman. It was as
cold in the tent as it was outside. She channeled flames atop the ashes in the firepit and tied the flow.
“You said you would not do it again.”
“I said that since the Wise Ones could watch his dreams, we should allow him some privacy.
They have not asked again since he shut them out, and I have not offered. Remember that they have
their own goals, which may not be those of the Tower.”
As quickly as that, they had come to it. Egwene was still not sure how to tell what she knew
without betraying herself to the Wise Ones, but perhaps the only method was to just tell it and then
feel her way. “Elaida is Amyrlin, Moiraine. I do not know what has happened to Siuan.”
“How do you know?” Moiraine said quietly. “Did you learn something dreamwalking? Or has
your Talent as a Dreamer finally manifested itself?”
That was her way out. Some of the Aes Sedai in the Tower thought that she might be a Dreamer,
a woman whose dreams foretold the future. She did have dreams that she knew were significant, but
learning to interpret them was another matter. The Wise Ones said the knowledge had to come from
within, and none of the Aes Sedai had been any more help. Rand sitting down in a chair, and
somehow she knew that the chair’s owner would be murderously angry at having her chair taken; that
the owner was a woman was as much as she could pick out of that, and not a thing more. Sometimes
the dreams were complex. Perrin, lounging with Faile on his lap, kissing her while she played with
the short-cut beard that he wore in the dream. Behind them two banners waved, a red wolf’s head and
a crimson eagle. A man in a bright yellow coat stood near to Perrin’s shoulder, a sword strapped to
his back; in some way she knew that he was a Tinker, though no Tinker would even touch a sword.
And every bit of it except the beard seemed important. The banners, Faile kissing Perrin, even the
Tinker. Every time he moved closer to Perrin it was as if a chill of doom shot through everything.
Another dream. Mat throwing dice with blood streaming down his face, the wide brim of his hat
pulled low so she could not see his wound, while Thom Merrilin put his hand into a fire to draw out
the small blue stone that now dangled on Moiraine’s forehead. Or a dream of a storm, great dark
clouds rolling without wind or rain while forked lightning bolts, every one identical, rent the earth.
She had the dreams, but as a Dreamer she was a failure so far.
“I saw an arrest warrant for you, Moiraine, signed by Elaida as Amyrlin. And it was no ordinary
dream.” All true. Just not all of the truth. She was suddenly glad that Nynaeve was not there. I’d be
the one staring at a cup, if she was.
“The Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills. Perhaps it will not matter so much if Rand takes the

Aiel across the Dragonwall. I doubt that Elaida has continued to approach rulers, even if she knows
that Siuan was doing so.”
“Is that all you can say? I think Siuan was your friend once, Moiraine. Can’t you shed a tear for
her?”
The Aes Sedai looked at her, and that cool, serene gaze told her how far she had to go before she
could use that title herself. Sitting, Egwene was nearly a head taller, and she was stronger in the
Power besides, but there was more to being Aes Sedai than strength. “I have no time for tears,
Egwene. The Dragonwall is not many days distant now, and the Alguenya. . . . Siuan and I were
friends, once. In a few months it will be twenty-one years since we began the search for the Dragon
Reborn. Only the two of us, newly raised Aes Sedai. Sierin Vayu was raised Amyrlin shortly after, a
Gray with more than a touch of Red in her. Had she learned what we intended, we would have spent
the rest of our lives doing penance with Red sisters watching us even while we slept. There is a
saying in Cairhien, though I have heard it as far away as Tarabon and Saldaea. ‘Take what you want,
and pay for it.’ Siuan and I took the path we wanted, and we knew we would have to pay for it
eventually.”
“I do not see how you can be so calm. Siuan could be dead, or even stilled. Elaida will either
oppose Rand altogether or try to hold him somewhere until Tarmon Gai’don; you know she’ll never
let a man who can channel run free. At least not everyone is behind Elaida. Some of the Blue Ajah are
gathering somewhere—I don’t know where yet—and I think others have left the Tower, too. Nynaeve
said that she was given a message about all sisters being welcome to return to the Tower by an eyesand-ears of the Yellow. If Blues and Yellows have both gone, others must have. And if they oppose
Elaida, they may support Rand.”
Moiraine sighed, a soft sound. “Do you expect me to be happy that the White Tower has split
apart? I am Aes Sedai, Egwene. I gave my life to the Tower long before I ever suspected the Dragon
would be Reborn in my lifetime. The Tower has been a bulwark against the Shadow for three
thousand years. It has guided rulers to wise decisions, stopped wars before they began, halted wars
that did begin. That humankind even remembers that the Dark One waits to escape, that the Last Battle
will come, is because of the Tower. The Tower, whole and united. I could almost wish that every
sister had sworn to Elaida, whatever happened to Siuan.”
“And Rand?” Egwene kept her voice just as steady, just as smooth. The flames were beginning
to put a little warmth into the air, but Moiraine had just added her own chill. “The Dragon Reborn.
You yourself said that he cannot be ready for Tarmon Gai’don unless he is allowed his freedom, both
to learn and to affect the world. The Tower united could take him prisoner despite all the Aiel in the
Waste.”
Moiraine smiled a small smile. “You learn. Cool reason is always better than hot words. But
you forget that only thirteen sisters linked can shield any man from saidin, and even if they do not
know the trick of tying flows, fewer can hold that shield.”
“I know you are not giving up, Moiraine. What do you mean to do?”
“I mean to deal with the world as I find the world, for as long as I can. At least Rand will be—
easier to be around—now that I no longer need try to turn him from what he wants. I suppose I should
be happy that he does not make me fetch his wine. He does listen most of the time, even if he seldom
gives any sign what he thinks of what I tell him.”
“I will leave you to tell him about Siuan and the Tower.” That would avoid awkward questions;
with Rand as bigheaded as he was, he might want to know more about her Dreaming than she could
invent. “There’s something else. Nynaeve has seen Forsaken in Tel’aran’rhiod. She mentioned every

last one still alive except Asmodean and Moghedien. Including Lanfear. She thinks they are plotting
something, perhaps together.”
“Lanfear,” Moiraine said after a moment.
They both knew that Lanfear had visited Rand in Tear, and maybe other times that he had not told
them of. No one had much knowledge of the Forsaken except the Forsaken themselves—only
fragments of fragments remained in the Tower—but it was known that Lanfear had loved Lews Therin
Telamon. They two, and Rand, knew that she still did.
“With luck,” the Aes Sedai went on, “we will not have to worry about Lanfear. The others
Nynaeve saw are another matter. You and I must keep as close a watch as we can. I wish more of the
Wise Ones could channel.” She gave a small laugh. “But I might as well wish they were all Tower
trained while I am about it, or to live forever. They may be strong in many ways, but they are sadly
lacking in others.”
“A watch is all very well, but what else? If six Forsaken come at him together, he will need
every bit of help we can give him.”
Moiraine leaned over to put a hand on her arm, a look of affection on her face. “We cannot hold
his hand forever, Egwene. He has learned to walk. He is learning to run. We can only hope he learns
before his enemies catch him. And, of course, continue to advise him. To guide him when we can.”
Straightening, she stretched, and stifled a small yawn behind her hand. “It is late, Egwene. And I
expect that Rand will have us breaking camp in a very few hours now, even if he gets no sleep at all.
I, however, would like to take what rest I can before facing my saddle.”
Egwene made ready to go, but first she had a question. “Moiraine, why have you started doing
everything Rand tells you to? Even Nynaeve doesn’t think it is right.”
“She does not, does she?” Moiraine murmured. “She will be Aes Sedai yet, whatever she
wishes. Why? Because I remembered how to control saidar.”
After a moment, Egwene nodded. To control saidar, first you had to surrender to it.
It was not until she was shivering her way back to her own tent that she realized Moiraine had
spoken to her the whole time as an equal. Perhaps she was closer to being ready to choose her Ajah
than she thought.

CHAPTER
16

An Unexpected Offer

Sunlight creeping through the window woke Nynaeve. For a moment she lay sprawled atop the
striped coverlet. Elayne lay sleeping in the other bed. The early morning was already warm, and the
night had not been much better, but that was not the reason Nynaeve’s shift was twisted and sweaty.
Her dreams after discussing what she had seen with Elayne had not been good. In most she had been
back in the Tower, being dragged before the Amyrlin, who was sometimes Elaida and sometimes
Moghedien. In some Rand had been lying beside the Amyrlin’s writing table like a dog, collared and
leashed and muzzled. The dreams about Egwene had been as bad in a way; boiled catfern and
powdered mavinsleaf tasted just as bad in a dream as they did awake.
Making her way to the washstand, she cleansed her face, and scrubbed her teeth with salt and
soda. The water was not hot, but it could not be called cool either. The sodden shift she stripped off,
and dug a fresh one from one of the chests, along with a hairbrush and mirror. Peering at her own
image, she regretted undoing her braid for comfort. It had not helped, and now her hair hung in a
tangle to her waist. Sitting down on the chest, she laboriously worked the knots out, then began giving
her hair its hundred strokes.
Three scratches ran down her neck and disappeared beneath her shift. They were not as red as
they might have been, thanks to an ointment of healall taken from the Macura woman. She had told
Elayne they came from brambles. Foolish—she suspected that Elayne knew it was not true, despite
her tale of looking about the Tower grounds after Egwene left—but she had been too upset to think
straight. She had snapped at the other woman several times, for no reason except that she was thinking
about her unfair treatment by Melaine and Egwene. Not that it doesn’t do her good to be reminded
she’s not the Daughter-Heir here. Still, it was none of the girl’s fault; she would have to make it up
to her.
In the mirror she saw Elayne rise and begin washing. “I still think my plan is best,” the girl said,
scrubbing her face. Her raven-dyed hair did not seem to have one snarl, despite her curls. “We could
be in Tear much more quickly my way.”
Her plan was to abandon the coach once they reached the Eldar, at some small village where
there would not likely be many Whitecloaks, and just as important, no eyes-and-ears for the Tower.
There they were to take a riverboat down to Ebou Dar, where they could find a ship for Tear. That
they had to go to Tear was no longer in doubt. Tar Valon they would avoid at all cost.
“How long before a boat stops where we are?” Nynaeve said patiently. She had thought this was
all settled before they went to sleep. It had been, to her mind. “You yourself said that every boat
might not stop. And how long do we wait in Ebou Dar before we find a ship for Tear?” Putting the
brush down, she began remaking her braid.

“The villagers hang out a flag if they want a boat to put in, and most will. And there are always
ships for anywhere in a seaport the size of Ebou Dar.”
As if the girl had ever been in a seaport of any size before leaving the Tower with Nynaeve.
Elayne always thought that whatever she had not learned of the world as Daughter-Heir of Andor, she
had learned in the Tower, even after plenty of proof to the contrary. And how dare she put on that
forbearing tone with her! “We are not likely to find that gathering of Blues on a ship, Elayne.”
Her own plan was to stick with the coach, cross the rest of Amadicia, then Altara and Murandy,
to Far Madding in the Hills of Kintara, and over the Plains of Maredo to Tear. It would certainly take
longer, but aside from the chance of finding that gathering somehow, coaches very rarely sank. She
could swim, but she was not comfortable with land completely out of sight.
Patting her face dry, Elayne changed her shift and came to help with doing the braid. Nynaeve
was not fooled; she would hear about boats again. Her stomach did not like boats. Not that that had
influenced her decision, of course. If she could bring Aes Sedai to Rand’s aid, it would be well
worth the longer travel time.
“Have you recalled the name?” Elayne asked, weaving the strands of hair.
“At least I remembered there was a name. Light, give me time.” She was sure there had been a
name. A town, it would have to be, or a city. She could not have seen the name of a country and
forgotten it. Drawing a long breath, she took a hold on her temper, and went on in a milder tone. “I
will remember it, Elayne. Just give me time.”
Elayne made a noncommittal sound and continued braiding. After a bit, she said, “Was it really
wise to send Birgitte looking for Moghedien?”
Nynaeve shot the young woman a sidelong frown, but it rolled off her like water off oiled silk.
As a change of subject, this was not the one she would have chosen. “Better we find her than she finds
us.”
“I suppose so. But what will we do when we find her?”
She had no answer for that. But it was better to be the hunter than the hunted, however roughly it
went. The Black Ajah had taught her that.
The common room was not crowded when they went down, yet even at that early hour there was
a sprinkling of pale cloaks among the patrons, mostly on older men, all with officers’ rank. No doubt
they preferred to eat from the inn’s kitchens rather than what Whitecloak cooks dished up in the
garrison. Nynaeve would almost rather have eaten on a tray again, but that little room was like a box.
All of these men were intent on their food, the Whitecloaks no less than the others. Surely it was quite
safe. Cooking smells filled the air; apparently these men wanted beef or mutton even first thing in the
morning.
No sooner did Elayne’s foot leave the last step than Mistress Jharen bustled up to offer them, or
“the Lady Morelin” rather, a private dining room. Nynaeve never shifted her eyes toward Elayne, but
the other woman said, “I think we will eat here. I seldom have the opportunity to eat in a common
room, and I quite enjoy it, really. Have one of your girls bring us something cooling. If the day is like
this already, I fear I’ll swelter before we reach the next stop.”
It was a constant wonder to Nynaeve that that haughty manner never got them thrown bodily into
the street. She had met enough lords and ladies by now to know that nearly all behaved in that fashion,
but still. She would not have put up with it for a minute. The innkeeper, though, bobbed a curtsy,
smiling and drywashing her hands, then showed them to a table near a window looking onto the street
and scurried away to do Elayne’s bidding. Perhaps that was her way of getting back at the girl. They
were off by themselves, well away from the men already at other tables, but anyone walking by could

stare in at them, and if any of their food was hot—which she hoped it was not—they were as far from
the kitchens as it was possible to be.
When it came, breakfast consisted of spicy muffins—wrapped in a white cloth and still warm,
and pleasant even so—yellow pears, blue grapes that looked a bit wizened, and some sort of red
things that the serving girl called strawberries, though they looked like no berry that Nynaeve had
ever seen. They certainly did not taste anything like straw, especially with clotted cream spooned on
top. Elayne claimed to have heard of them, but then she would. With a lightly spiced wine supposedly
cooled in the springhouse—one sip told her that the spring was not very cool, if there was one—it
made a refreshing morning meal.
The nearest man was three tables away, and he wore a dark blue woolen coat, a prosperous
tradesman perhaps, but they did not talk. Plenty of time for that when they were on the road again, and
could be sure that there was no danger of sharp ears. Nynaeve finished her food well before Elayne.
The way the girl took her time quartering a pear, you would think they had all day to sit at table.
Suddenly Elayne’s eyes went wide with shock, and the short knife clattered to the table.
Nynaeve’s head whipped around to find a man taking the bench on the other side of the table.
“I thought it was you, Elayne, but the hair put me off at first.”
Nynaeve stared at Galad, Elayne’s half-brother. Stared was the word, of course. Tall and steely
slender, dark of hair and eye, he was the most handsome man she had ever seen. Handsome was not
enough; he was gorgeous. She had seen women cluster around him in the Tower, even Aes Sedai, all
of them smiling like fools. She wiped the smile from her own face. But she could do nothing about her
racing heart, nor make herself breathe properly. She did not feel anything for him; it was just that he
was beautiful. Take hold of yourself, woman!
“What are you doing here?” She was pleased that she did not sound strangled. It was not fair for
a man to look like that.
“And what are you doing wearing that?” Elayne’s voice was low, but it still held a snap.
Nynaeve blinked, and realized he wore a shirt of shining mail and a white cloak with two golden
knots of rank beneath a flaring sun. She felt color rising in her cheeks. Staring at a man’s face so hard
that she had not even seen what he was wearing! She wanted to hide her own face from humiliation.
He smiled, and Nynaeve had to take a deep breath. “I am here because I was one of the Children
recalled from the north. And I am a Child of the Light because it seemed the right thing to do. Elayne,
when you two and Egwene vanished, it did not take long for Gawyn and me to find out that you were
not doing penance on a farm, whatever we were told. They had no right to involve you in their plots,
Elayne. Any of you.”
“You seem to have attained rank very quickly,” Nynaeve said. Did the fool man not realize that
talking of Aes Sedai plots here was a good way to get them both killed?
“Eamon Valda seemed to think my experience warranted it, wherever gained.” His shrug
dismissed rank as unimportant. It was not modesty, precisely, but not pretense either. The finest
swordsman among those who came to study with the Warders in the Tower, he had also stood high in
the classes on strategy and tactics, but Nynaeve could not remember him boasting about his prowess,
even in jest. Accomplishments meant nothing to him, perhaps because they came so easily.
“Does Mother know of this?” Elayne demanded, still in that quiet voice. Her scowl would have
frightened a wild boar, though.
Galad shifted just a hair, uneasily. “There has been no good time to write her. But do not be so
sure she will disapprove, Elayne. She is not so friendly with the north as she was. I hear a ban may be
made law.”

“I sent her a letter, explaining.” Elayne’s glare had transformed to puzzlement. “She must
understand. She trained in the Tower, too.”
“Keep your voice down,” he said, low and hard. “Remember where you are.” Elayne flushed a
deep red, but whether in anger or embarrassment, Nynaeve could not say.
Abruptly she realized that he had been speaking as quietly as they, and carefully, too. He had not
mentioned the Tower once, or Aes Sedai.
“Is Egwene with you?” he went on.
“No,” she replied, and he sighed deeply.
“I had hoped . . . Gawyn was nearly unhinged with worry when she disappeared. He cares for
her, too. Will you tell me where she is?”
Nynaeve took note of that “too.” The man had become a Whitecloak, yet he “cared for” a woman
who wanted to be Aes Sedai. Men were so strange they were hardly human sometimes.
“We will not,” Elayne said firmly, the crimson receding from her cheeks. “Is Gawyn here, too? I
will not believe he has become a—” She had the wit to lower her voice further, but she still said, “A
Whitecloak!”
“He remains in the north, Elayne.” Nynaeve supposed that he meant Tar Valon, but surely Gawyn
had gone from there. Surely he could not support Elaida. “You cannot know what has happened there,
Elayne,” he continued. “All the corruption and vileness in that place bubbled to the top, as it had to.
The woman who sent you away has been deposed.” He looked around and dropped his voice to a
momentary whisper, despite no one being close enough to overhear. “Stilled and executed.” Taking a
deep breath, he made a disgusted sound. “It was never a place for you. Or for Egwene. I have not
been long with the Children, but I am certain my captain will give me leave to escort my sister home.
That is where you should be, with Mother. Tell me where Egwene is, and I will see that she is
brought to Caemlyn, too. You will both be safe there.”
Nynaeve’s face felt numb. Stilled. And executed. Not an accidental death, or illness. That she
had considered the possibility did not make the fact less shocking. Rand had to be the reason. If there
had ever been any small hope that the Tower might not oppose him, it was gone. Elayne showed no
expression at all, her eyes staring at the distance.
“I see my news shocks you,” he said in a low voice. “I do not know how deeply that woman
meshed you in her plot, but you are free of her now. Let me see you safely to Caemlyn. No one need
know you had any more contact with her than the other girls who went there to learn. Either of you.”
Nynaeve showed him her teeth, in what she hoped looked like a smile. It was nice to be
included, finally. She could have smacked him. If only he were not so good-looking.
“I will think on it,” Elayne said slowly. “What you say makes sense, but you must give me time
to think. I must think.”
Nynaeve stared at her. It made sense? The girl was blathering.
“I can give you a little time,” he said, “but I do not have much if I am to ask leave. We may be
ordered—”
Suddenly there was a square-faced, black-haired Whitecloak clapping Galad on the shoulder
and grinning widely. Older, he wore the same two knots of rank on his cloak. “Well, young Galad,
you can’t keep all the pretty women for yourself. Every girl in town sighs when you walk by, and
most of their mothers as well. Introduce me.”
Galad scraped back his bench to stand. “I . . . thought I knew them when they came downstairs,
Trom. But whatever charm you think I possess, it does not work on this lady. She does not like me,
and I think she will not like any friend of mine. If you practice the sword with me this afternoon,

perhaps you can attract one or two.”
“Never with you around,” Trom grumped good-naturedly. “And I’d sooner let the farrier pound
my head with his hammer than practice against you.” But he let Galad start him for the door with only
a regretful look at the two women. As they left, Galad shot a glance back at the table, full of
frustration and indecision.
No sooner were they out of sight than Elayne stood. “Nana, I need you upstairs.” Mistress Jharen
materialized at her side, inquiring if she had enjoyed her repast, and Elayne said, “I require my driver
and footman immediately. Nana will settle the bill.” She was moving for the stairs before she finished
speaking.
Nynaeve stared after her, then dug out her purse and paid the woman, making assurances that
everything had been to her mistress’s liking and trying not to wince at the price. Once rid of the
woman, she hurried upstairs. Elayne was stuffing their things into the chests any which way, including
the sweaty shifts they had hung on the ends of the beds to dry.
“Elayne, what’s the matter?”
“We must leave immediately, Nynaeve. At once.” She did not look up until the last article was
crammed in. “Right this minute, wherever he is, Galad is puzzling over something he may never have
faced before. Two things that are right, but opposite. To his mind it is right to tie me to a pack horse if
necessary and haul me to Mother, to salve her worries and save me from becoming Aes Sedai,
whatever I want. And it is also right to turn us in, to the Whitecloaks or the army or both. That is the
law in Amadicia, and Whitecloak law, too. Aes Sedai are outlawed here, and so is any woman who
has ever trained in the Tower. Mother met Ailron once to sign a trade treaty, and they had to do it in
Altara because Mother could not legally enter Amadicia. I embraced saidar the moment I saw him,
and I won’t let it go until we are far from him.”
“Surely you exaggerate, Elayne. He is your brother.”
“He is not my brother!” Elayne drew a deep breath and let it out slowly. “We had the same
father,” she said in a calmer voice, “but he is not my brother. I will not have him. Nynaeve, I’ve told
you time and again, but you will not take it in. Galad does what is right. Always. He never lies. Did
you hear what he said to that Trom fellow? He didn’t say he did not know who we are. Every word
he said was the truth. He does what is right, no matter who is hurt by it, even himself. Or me. He used
to tell on Gawyn and me for everything, and on himself, too. If he decides the wrong way, we will
have Whitecloaks lying in ambush for us before we reach the edge of the village.”
A tap sounded at the door, and Nynaeve’s breath caught in her throat. Surely Galad would not
really . . . Elayne’s face was set, ready to fight.
Hesitantly, Nynaeve cracked the door. It was Thom, and Juilin with that fool hat in his hand.
“My Lady wants us?” Thom asked, with a touch of servility for anyone who might overhear.
Able to breathe again, not caring who was listening, she snatched the door the rest of the way
open. “Get in here, you two!” She was growing tired of them looking at one another every time she
spoke.
Before she had the door shut again, Elayne said, “Thom, we must leave right away.” The
determined look had left her face, and anxiety filled her voice. “Galad is here. You must remember
what a monster he was as a child. Well, he is no better grown, and he is a Whitecloak besides. He
could—” The words seemed to catch in her throat. She stared at Thom, mouth working soundlessly,
but no more wide-eyed than he stared at her.
He sat down heavily on one of the chests, never taking his eyes from Elayne’s. “I—” Clearing
his throat roughly, he went on. “I thought I saw him, watching the inn. A Whitecloak. But he looked

the man the boy would grow into. I suppose it shouldn’t be a surprise he grew into a Whitecloak at
that.”
Nynaeve went to the window; Elayne and Thom hardly seemed to notice her passage between
them. Traffic was beginning to pick up in the street, farmers and farm carts and villagers mingling
with Whitecloaks and soldiers. Across the way, one Whitecloak was sitting on an upended barrel,
that perfect face unmistakable.
“Did he—?” Elayne swallowed. “Did he recognize you?”
“No. Fifteen years changes a man more than it does a boy. Elayne, I thought you had forgotten.”
“I remembered in Tanchico, Thom.” With a wavering smile, Elayne reached out and tugged one
of his long mustaches. Thom smiled back almost as unsteadily; he looked as if he was contemplating a
leap from the window.
Juilin was scratching his head, and Nynaeve wished she had some idea what they were talking
about, too, but there were more important matters at hand. “We still have to leave before he brings the
entire garrison down on us. With him watching, it won’t be easy. I haven’t seen another patron who
looks like they have a coach.”
“Ours is the only one in the stableyard,” Juilin said. Thom and Elayne were still staring at one
another, plainly not hearing a word.
Driving off with the curtains down was no protection, then. Nynaeve was willing to bet that
Galad had already learned exactly how they had come to Sienda. “Is there a back way from the
stableyard?”
“A gate wide enough for one of us at a time,” Juilin said dryly. “And what’s on the other side is
little more than an alley, anyway. There aren’t more than two or three streets in this village wide
enough for the coach.” He studied that cylindrical hat, turning it in his hands. “I could get close
enough to crack his head. If you were ready, you could drive off during the confusion. I could catch
you up on the road.”
Nynaeve sniffed loudly. “How? Gallop after on Skulker? Even if you didn’t fall out of the saddle
inside a mile, do you think you would even reach a horse if you attacked a Whitecloak in that street?”
Galad was still there across the street, and Trom had joined him, the pair apparently chatting idly.
She leaned over and yanked Thom’s nearest mustache. “Do you have anything to add? Any brilliant
plans? Did all your listening to gossip yield anything that might help?”
He clapped a hand to his face and gave her an offended look. “Not unless you think there’s help
in Ailron laying claim to some border villages in Altara. A strip the whole length of the border, from
Salidar to So Eban to Mosra. Is there any help in that, Nynaeve? Is there? Try to pull a man’s
mustache out of his face. Somebody ought to box your ears, for once.”
“What would Ailron want with a strip along the border, Thom?” Elayne asked. Perhaps she was
interested—she seemed interested in every fool twist and turn of politics and diplomacy—or perhaps
she was just trying to stop an argument. She used to try smoothing over things all the time, before she
became wrapped up in flirting with Thom.
“It isn’t the King, child.” His voice softened, for her. “It’s Pedron Niall. Ailron does what he is
told usually, though he and Niall make out that it isn’t so. Most of those villages have been empty
since the Whitecloak War, what the Children call the Troubles. Niall was the general in the field then,
and I doubt he’s ever given up wanting Altara. If he controls both banks of the Eldar, he can squeeze
the river trade to Ebou Dar, and if he can crack Ebou Dar, the rest of Altara will trickle into his hands
like grain flowing from a hole in a sack.”
“That is all very well,” Nynaeve said firmly before he or the girl could speak again. There had

been something in what he had said that tickled her memory, but she could not say what or why. In any
case, they had no time for lectures on relations between Amadicia and Altara, not with Galad and
Trom watching the front of the inn. She said as much, adding, “What about you, Juilin? You consort
with low types.” The thief-catcher always sought out the cutpurses and burglars and footpads in a
town; he claimed they knew more of what was really going on than any official. “Are there smugglers
we can bribe to sneak us out, or . . . or . . . You know the sort of thing we need, man.”
“I heard little. Thieves keep low in Amadicia, Nynaeve. First offense is branding, second is loss
of your fight hand, and third is hanging, whether it’s the King’s crown or a loaf of bread. There aren’t
many thieves in a town this size, not who do it for a living”—he was contemptuous of amateur thieves
—“and for the most part they only wanted to talk about two things. Whether the Prophet is really
coming to Amadicia, the way rumor says he is, and whether the town fathers might relent and let that
traveling menagerie put on a show. Sienda is too far from the borders for smugglers to—”
She cut him off with peremptory satisfaction. “That is it! The menagerie.” They all looked at her
as if she had gone mad.
“Of course,” Thom said, much too mildly. “We can get Luca to bring the boar-horses back, and
make off while they destroy some more of the town. I don’t know what you gave him, Nynaeve, but he
threw a rock at us as we were driving off.”
For once Nynaeve forgave him his sarcasm, feeble as it was. And his lack of wit to see what she
saw. “That’s as may be, Thom Merrilin, but Master Luca wants a patron, and Elayne and I are going
to be his patrons. We still have to abandon the coach and team—” That smarted; she could have built
a snug house in the Two Rivers for what they had cost. “—And sneak out that back way.” Tossing
open the chest with the leaf-shaped hinges, she rooted through clothes and blankets and pots and
everything that she had not wanted to leave behind with the wagon full of dyes—she had made sure
that the men packed everything except the harness—until she came to the gilded caskets and the
purses. “Thom, you and Juilin go out by that back gate, and find a wagon and team of some sort. Buy
some supplies and meet us on the road back to Luca’s camp.” Regretfully, she filled Thom’s hand
with gold, not even bothering to count; there was no telling what things would cost, and she did not
want him wasting time bargaining.
“That is a wonderful idea,” Elayne said, grinning. “Galad will be looking for two women, not a
troupe of animals and jugglers. And he will never think we would head for Ghealdan.”
Nynaeve had not thought of that. She had intended making Luca head straight for Tear. A
menagerie such as he had put together, with tumblers and jugglers in addition to animals, could earn
its way almost anywhere, she was sure. But if Galad did come looking for them, or send someone, it
would be to the east. And he might be smart enough to look even in a menagerie; men did show brains
sometimes, usually when you least expected it. “That was the first thing I thought of, Elayne.” She
ignored the sudden faint taste in her mouth, the acrid memory of boiled catfern and powered
mavinsleaf.
Thom and Juilin protested, of course. Not the idea as such, but they seemed to think that one of
them remaining behind could protect her and Elayne against Galad and any number of Whitecloaks.
They did not seem to realize that if it came to that, channeling would do more than the pair of them
and ten more besides. They still seemed troubled, but she managed to push them both out with the
stern injunction “And don’t you dare come back here. We will meet you on the road.”
“If it comes to channeling,” Elayne quietly said once the door was shut, “we will quickly find
ourselves facing the whole Whitecloak garrison, and probably the army garrison as well. The Power
doesn’t make us invincible. All it will take is two arrows.”

“We will worry about that when it comes,” Nynaeve told her. She hoped the men had not thought
of that. If they had, likely one of them would lurk about, and probably rouse Galad’s suspicions if he
was not careful. She was ready to accept their help when it was needed—Ronde Macura had taught
her that, though having to be rescued like a kitten down a well still galled—but it would be when she
thought it necessary, not they.
A quick trip downstairs found Mistress Jharen. Her lady had changed her mind; she did not think
she could face the heat and dust of travel again so quickly; she intended to nap, and did not want to be
disturbed until a late supper that she would send down for. Here was the coin for another night’s
lodging. The innkeeper was very understanding of a noble lady’s delicacy, and how inconstant their
desires. Nynaeve thought, Mistress Jharen would be understanding of anything short of murder, so
long as the reckoning was paid.
Leaving the plump woman, Nynaeve cornered one of the serving girls for a moment. A few
silver pennies changed hands, and the girl darted off in her apron to find two of the deep bonnets that
Nynaeve said looked so shady and cool; not the sort of thing her lady would wear, of course, but they
would do nicely for her.
When she got back to the room, Elayne had the gilded caskets on a blanket with the dark
polished box holding the recovered ter’angreal and the washleather purse that held the seal. The fat
purses of coin lay beside Nynaeve’s scrip on the other bed. Folding the blanket, Elayne tied the
bundle with some stout cord from one of their chests. Nynaeve had saved everything.
She regretted leaving it all behind now. It was not just the expense. Not only that. You never
knew when something was going to come in handy. Take the two woolen dresses that Elayne had laid
out on her bed. They were not fine enough for a lady, and too fine for a lady’s maid, but if they had
left them in Mardeein as Elayne had wanted, they would be in a fine fix for clothing now.
Kneeling, Nynaeve rummaged in another chest. A few shifts, two more wool dresses for
changes. The pair of cast-iron frying pans in a canvas bag were perfectly good, but too heavy, and the
men would certainly not forget replacements for those. The sewing kit, in its neat bone-inlaid box;
they would never think to buy so much as a pin. Her mind was only partly on her selections, though.
“You knew Thom before?” she asked in what she hoped was a casual tone. She watched Elayne
from the corner of her eye while pretending to concentrate on rolling stockings.
The girl had begun pulling out clothes of her own, sighing over the silks before putting them
aside. She froze with her hands deep in one of the chests, and she did not look at Nynaeve. “He was
Court-bard in Caemlyn when I was little,” she said quietly.
“I see.” She did not see at all. How did a man go from a court-bard, entertaining royalty, the next
thing to a noble, to a gleeman wandering from village to village?
“He was Mother’s lover after Father died.” Elayne had gone back to choosing, and she said it so
matter-of-factly that Nynaeve gaped.
“Your mother’s—!”
The other woman still was not looking at her, though. “I did not remember him until Tanchico. I
was very small. It was his mustaches, and standing close enough to look up at his face, and hearing
him recite part of The Great Hunt of the Horn. He thought I’d forgotten again.” Her face colored
slightly. “I—drank too much wine, and the next day I made out that I could not remember anything.”
Nynaeve could only shake her head. She remembered the night the girl had filled her fool self
with wine. At least she had never done that again; her head the next morning had seemed an effective
cure. Now she knew why the girl behaved as she did with Thom. She had seen the same back in the
Two Rivers a few times. A girl just old enough to really think of herself as a woman. Who else would

she measure herself against except her mother? And sometimes, who better to compete against, to
prove that she was a woman? Usually it led to no more than trying to be better at everything from
cooking to sewing, or maybe some harmless flirting with her father, but in the case of one widow,
Nynaeve had seen the woman’s nearly grown daughter make a complete fool of herself trying to
capture the man her mother intended to marry. The trouble was, Nynaeve had no idea what to do
about this silliness in Elayne. Despite severe lectures and more from her and the Women’s Circle,
Sari Ayellin had not settled down until her mother was married again and she herself had found a
husband, too.
“I suppose he must have been like a second father to you,” Nynaeve said carefully. She
pretended to concentrate on her own packing. Thom had certainly been looking at the girl that way. It
explained so much.
“I hardly think of him so.” Elayne appeared intent on deciding how many silk shifts to take, but
her eyes saddened. “I cannot really remember my father; I was only a baby when he died. Gawyn says
he spent all of his time with Galad. Lini tried to make the best of it, but I know he never came to see
Gawyn or me in the nursery. He would have, I know, once we were old enough to teach things, like
Galad. But he died.”
Nynaeve tried again. “At least Thom is fit for a man of his age. We’d be in a fine fix if he
suffered from stiff joints. Old men often do.”
“He could still do backflips if not for his limp. And I don’t care if he does limp. He is intelligent
and knowledgeable about the world. He is gentle, and yet I feel quite safe with him. I don’t think I
should tell him that. He tries to protect me enough as it is.”
With a sigh, Nynaeve gave up. For now, at least. Thom might look on Elayne as a daughter, but if
the girl kept this up he just might remember that she was not, and then Elayne would find herself in the
pickling kettle. “Thom is very fond of you, Elayne.” Time to shift to some other subject. “Are you
sure about Galad? Elayne? Are you sure Galad could turn us in, Elayne?”
The other woman gave a start, wiping a small frown from her face.
“What? Galad? I’mcertain, Nynaeve. And if we refuse to let him take us to Caemlyn, that will
only make the decision for him.”
Muttering to herself, Nynaeve pulled a silk riding dress out of her chest. Sometimes she thought
the Creator had only made men to cause trouble for women.

CHAPTER
17

Heading West

When the serving girl came with the bonnets, Elayne was stretched out on one of the beds in a
white silk shift, a damp cloth over her eyes, and Nynaeve was pretending to mend the hem of the pale
green dress that Elayne had been wearing. As often as not she stuck her thumb; she would never have
admitted it to anyone, but she was not very good at needlework. She wore her dress, of course—
maids did not loll about like ladies—but she did have her hair hanging loose. Clearly she had no
intention of leaving the room any time soon. She thanked the girl in a whisper, so as not to wake her
lady, and pressed another silver penny on her, with the repeated injunction that her lady was not to be
disturbed on any account.
As soon as the door clicked shut, Elayne bounded to her feet and began pulling their bundles out
from under the beds. Nynaeve tossed the silk gown down and twisted her arms behind her to undo her
buttons. In no time at all they were ready, Nynaeve in green wool, Elayne in blue, with the bundles on
their backs. Nynaeve carried the scrip with her herbs and the money, Elayne the blanket-wrapped
boxes. The deep curving brims of the bonnets hid their faces so well that Nynaeve thought they could
have walked right by Galad without him knowing them, especially with her hair down; he would
remember the braid. Mistress Jharen, however, might well stop two strange women coming with fat
bundles from upstairs.
The back stairs ran down the outside of the inn, narrow stone flights clinging to the wall.
Nynaeve felt a moment of sympathy for Thom and Juilin, hauling the heavy chests up these, but mainly
her attention was on the stableyard and the slate-roofed stone stable. A yellow dog lay in the shade
beneath the coach, sheltering from the already increasing heat, but all of the grooms were inside. Now
and again she could see movement beyond the open stable doors, but no one came out; it was shady in
there, too.
They trotted quickly across the stableyard to the alley between the stable and a tall stone fence.
A full dung cart, swarming with flies and scarcely narrower than the alleyway, was just rumbling by.
Nynaeve suspected that the glow of saidar surrounded Elayne, though she could not see it. She herself
was hoping that the dog did not decide to bark, that no one came out of the kitchens or the stable.
Using the Power was no way to sneak off quietly, and talking their way clear would leave traces for
Galad to follow.
The rough wooden gate at the end of the alley had only a lift-latch, and the narrow street beyond,
lined with simple stone houses with more thatched roofs than otherwise, was empty except for a
handful of boys playing some game that seemed to involve hitting each other with a beanbag. The only
adult in sight was a man feeding a cote of pigeons on a roof opposite, his head and shoulders up
through a trapdoor. Neither he nor the boys more than glanced at them as they shut the gate and started

along the winding street as if they had every right to be there.
They had walked a good five miles west of Sienda along the dusty road before Thom and Juilin
caught up, Thom driving what looked like a Tinker’s wagon, save that it was all one color, a drab
green, with the paint flaked off in large patches. Nynaeve was grateful to stuff her bundles under the
driver’s seat and climb up beside him, but not so pleased to see Juilin riding Skulker. “I told you not
to go back to the inn,” she told him, vowing to hit him with something if he looked at Thom.
“I did not go back,” he said, unaware that he had saved himself a sore head. “I told the head
stableman that my Lady wanted berries fresh from the country, and Thom and I had to go fetch them.
It’s the sort of nonsense that some no—” He cut off, clearing his throat, as Elayne gave him a cool,
expressionless look from the other side of Thom. Sometimes he forgot that she really was of royalty.
“We had to have some reason to leave the inn and the stables,” Thom said, whipping up the
horses. “I suppose you two said you were taking to your room with fainting spells, or the Lady
Morelin was, but the grooms would have been wondering why we wanted to wander about in the heat
instead of staying in a nice cool hayloft with no work to do, and maybe a pitcher of ale. Perhaps we’ll
not be worth talking about, now.”
Elayne gave Thom a level look—no doubt for the “fainting spells”—that he pretended not to see.
Or perhaps did not. Men could be blind when it suited them. Nynaeve sniffed loudly; he could not
miss that. He certainly cracked his whip over the lead horses sharply enough right after. It was all just
an excuse so they could take turns riding. That was another thing men did; made excuses to do exactly
what they wanted. At least Elayne was frowning at him slightly instead of simpering.
“There is something else I learned last night,” Thom went on after a time. “Pedron Niall is trying
to unite the nations against Rand.”
“Not that I don’t believe it, Thom,” Nynaeve said, “but how could you learn that? I cannot think
some Whitecloak simply told you.”
“Too many people were saying the same thing, Nynaeve. There’s a false Dragon in Tear. A false
Dragon, and never mind prophecies about the Stone of Tear falling, or Callandor. This fellow is
dangerous, and the nations ought to unite, the way they did in the Aiel War. And who better to lead
them against this false Dragon than Pedron Niall? When so many tongues say the same thing, the same
thought exists higher up, and in Amadicia, not even Ailron expresses a thought without asking Niall
first.”
The old gleeman always seemed to put together rumors and whispers and come up with right
answers far more often than not. No, not a gleeman; she had to remember that. Whatever he might
claim, he had been a court-bard, and had probably seen court intrigue like that in his stories at close
hand. Perhaps even dabbled in it himself, if he had been Morgase’s lover. She eyed him sideways,
that leathery face with bushy white eyebrows, those long mustaches as snowy as the hair on his head.
There was no accounting for some women’s taste.
“It isn’t as if we should not have expected something like this.” She never had. But she should
have.
“Mother will support Rand,” Elayne said. “I know she will. She knows the Prophecies. And she
has as much influence as Pedron Niall.”
The slight shake of Thom’s head denied the last, at least. Morgase ruled a wealthy nation, but
there were Whitecloaks in every land and from every land. Nynaeve realized she was going to have
to start paying more attention to Thom. Perhaps he really did know as much as he pretended. “So now
you think we should have let Galad escort us to Caemlyn?”
Elayne leaned forward to give her a firm look past Thom. “Certainly not. For one thing, there is

no way to be sure that that would be his decision. And for another . . .” She straightened, obscuring
herself behind the man; she seemed to be talking to herself, reminding herself. “For another, if Mother
really has turned against the Tower, I want to do all my speaking to her by letter for the time being.
She is quite capable of holding us both in the palace for our own good. She may not be able to
channel, but I do not want to try going against her until I am full Aes Sedai. If then.”
“A strong woman,” Thom said pleasantly. “Morgase would teach you manners quickly enough,
Nynaeve.” She gave him another loud sniff—all that loose hair hanging over her shoulders was no
good for gripping—but the old fool only grinned at her.
The sun stood high by the time they reached the menagerie, still camped exactly where they had
left it, in the clearing by the road. In the still heat, even the oaks looked a bit wilted. Except for the
horses and the great gray boar-horses, the animals were all back in their cages and the humans were
out of sight, too, no doubt inside the wagons that looked not much different from theirs. Nynaeve and
the others had all climbed down before Valan Luca appeared, still in that ridiculous red silk cape.
There were no flowery speeches this time, no cape-swirling bows. His eyes widened when he
recognized Thom and Juilin, narrowed at the boxlike wagon behind them. He bent to peer into the
deep bonnets, and his smile was not pleasant. “So, come down in the world, have we, my Lady
Morelin? Or maybe we were never up at all. Stole a coach and some clothes, did you? Well, I would
hate to see such a pretty forehead branded. That is what they do here, in case you don’t know, if they
do not do worse. So since it seems you’ve been found out—else why are you running?—I would
suggest you hurry on as fast as you can. If you want your bloody penny back, it’s somewhere up the
road. I threw it after you, and it can lie there till Tarmon Gai’don for all I care.”
“You wanted a patron,” Nynaeve said as he was turning away. “We can be your patrons.”
“You?” he sneered. But he stopped. “Even if a few coins stolen from some lord’s purse would
help, I will not accept stolen—”
“We will pay your expenses, Master Luca,” Elayne broke in with that coolly arrogant tone of
hers, “and one hundred gold marks besides, if we can travel with you to Ghealdan, and if you agree
not to stop until you reach the border.” Luca stared at her, running his tongue over his teeth.
Nynaeve groaned softly. A hundred marks, and gold! A hundred silver would cover his expenses
easily, to Ghealdan and further, whatever those so-called boar-horses ate.
“You stole that much?” Luca said cautiously. “Who is after you? I won’t risk Whitecloaks, or the
army. They’ll throw us all into prison, and probably kill the animals.”
“My brother,” Elayne replied before Nynaeve could angrily deny that they had stolen anything.
“It seems that a marriage has been arranged while I was away, and my brother was sent to find me. I
have no intention of returning to Cairhien to marry a man a head shorter, three times my weight and
thrice my age.” Her cheeks colored in only a fair imitation of anger; her throat clearing did it better.
“My father has dreams of claiming the Sun Throne if he can gain enough support. My dreams concern
a red-haired Andorman whom I shall wed, whatever my father says. And that, Master Luca, is as
much as you need know of me and more.”
“Maybe you are who you say you are,” Luca said slowly, “and maybe you are not. Show me
some of this money you claim you’ll give me. Promises buy small cups of wine.”
Angrily Nynaeve fumbled in her scrip for the fattest purse and shook it at him, then stuffed it out
of sight when he reached for it. “You’ll get what you need as you need it. And the hundred marks after
we reach Ghealdan.” A hundred marks gold! They would have to find a banker and use those lettersof-rights if Elayne kept on like this.
Luca gave a sour grunt. “Whether you stole that or not, you are still running from somebody. I

won’t risk my show for you, whether it’s the army or some Cairhienin lord who might come looking.
The lord might be worse, if he thinks I have stolen his sister. You will have to blend in.” That
unpleasant smile came on his face again; he was not going to forget that silver penny. “Everybody
who travels with me works at something, and you must as well, if you mean not to stand out. If the
others know you are paying your way, they will talk, and you would not want that. Cleaning the cages
will do; the horse handlers are always complaining about having to do that. I’ll even find that penny
and give it back to you for pay. Never let it be said Valan Luca is not generous.”
Nynaeve was about to say in no uncertain terms that they would not pay his way to Ghealdan and
work, too, when Thom laid a hand on her arm. Wordlessly, he bent to scuffle up pebbles from the
ground and began juggling them, six in a circle.
“I have jugglers,” Luca said. The six became eight, then ten, a dozen. “You are not bad.” The
circle became two, intertwining. Luca rubbed at his chin. “Maybe I could find a use for you.”
“I can also eat fire,” Thom said, letting the stones fall, “perform with knives,” he fanned his
empty hands, then seemingly pulled a pebble from Luca’s ear, “and do a few other things.”
Luca suppressed his quick grin. “That does for you, but what about the rest?” He seemed angry
with himself for showing any enthusiasm or approval.
“What is that?” Elayne asked, pointing.
The two tall poles Nynaeve had seen being erected now each had ropes to stay it and a flat
platform at its top, with a rope stretched taut over the thirty paces between. A rope ladder hung from
each platform.
“That is Sedrin’s apparatus,” Luca replied, then shook his head. “Sedrin the highwalker,
dazzling with feats ten paces up on a thin rope. The fool.”
“I can walk on it,” Elayne told him. Thom reached for her arm as she took off her bonnet and
started forward, but he subsided at a small shake of her head and a smile.
Luca barred her way, though. “Listen, Morelin, or whatever your name is, your forehead may be
too pretty to brand, but your neck is far too pretty to snap. Sedrin knew what he was doing, and we
finished burying him not more than an hour ago. That’s why everyone is in their wagons. Of course, he
drank too much last night, after we were chased out of Sienda, but I’ve seen him highwalk with a
bellyful of brandy. I will tell you what. You do not have to clean cages. You move into my wagon,
and we will tell everyone you’re my ladylove. Just as a tale, of course.” His sly smile said he hoped
for more than a tale.
Elayne’s smile in return should have raised frost on him. “I do thank you for the offer, Master
Luca, but if you will kindly step aside. . . .” He had to, or else have her walk over him.
Juilin crumpled that cylindrical hat in his hands, then crammed it back onto his head as she began
climbing one of the rope ladders, having a little difficulty with her skirts. Nynaeve knew what the girl
was doing. The men should have, and perhaps Thom did, at least, but he still looked ready to rush
over to catch her if she fell. Luca moved nearer, as though the same thought was in his head.
For a moment Elayne stood on the platform, smoothing her dress. The platform looked much
smaller, and higher, with her on it. Then, delicately holding her skirts up as if to keep them out of
mud, she stepped out onto the narrow rope. She might as well have been walking across a street. In a
way, Nynaeve knew, she was. She could not see the glow of saidar, but she knew that Elayne had
woven a path between the two platforms, of Air, no doubt, turned hard as stone.
Abruptly Elayne put her hands down and turned two cartwheels, raven-black hair flailing, silkstockinged legs flashing in the sun. For the merest instant as she righted herself, her skirts seemed to
brush a flat surface before she snatched them up again. Two more steps took her to the far platform.

“Did Master Sedrin do that, Master Luca?”
“He did somersaults,” he shouted back. In a mutter, he added, “But he did not have legs like that.
A lady! Hah!”
“I am not the only one with this skill,” Elayne called. “Juilin and—” Nynaeve gave a fierce
shake of her head; channeling or no channeling, her stomach would enjoy that high rope as much as it
did a storm at sea. “—and I have done this many times. Come on, Juilin. Show him.”
The thief-catcher looked as if he would rather clean the cages with his bare hands. The lions’
cages, with the lions inside. He closed his eyes, mouth moving in a silent prayer, and went up the
rope ladder in the manner of a man mounting the scaffold. At the top, he stared from Elayne to the
rope with a fearful concentration. Abruptly, he stepped out, walking rapidly, arms stretched out to
either side, eyes fixed on Elayne and mouth moving in prayer. She climbed partway down the ladder
to make room for him on the platform, then had to help him find the rungs with his feet and guide him
down.
Thom grinned at her proudly as she came back and took her bonnet from Nynaeve. Juilin looked
as if he had been soaked in hot water and wrung out.
“That was good,” Luca said, rubbing his chin judiciously. “Not as good as Sedrin, mind, but
good. I especially like the way you make it seem so easy, while—Juilin?—Juilin pretends to be
frightened to death. That will go over very well.” Juilin gave the man a bleak grin that had something
of reaching for knives in it. Luca actually swirled that red cape as he turned to Nynaeve; he looked
very satisfied indeed. “And you, my dear Nana? What surprising talent do you have? Tumbling,
perhaps? Swallowing swords?”
“I dole out the money,” she told him, slapping the scrip. “Unless you want to offer me your
wagon?” She gave him a smile that wiped his clean away and backed him up two steps besides.
The shouting had roused people from the wagons, and everyone gathered around while Luca
introduced the troupe’s new performers. He was rather vague about Nynaeve, merely calling what she
did startling; she needed to have a talk with him.
The horse handlers, as Luca called the men who had no performing talent, were a scruffy, surly
lot in general, perhaps because they were paid less. There were not very many of them, compared to
the number of wagons. In fact, it turned out that everyone helped with the work, including driving the
wagons; there was not much money in a traveling menagerie, even one like this. The others were a
mixed lot.
Petra, the strongman, was the biggest man Nynaeve had ever seen. Not tall, but wide; his leather
vest showed arms the size of tree trunks. He was married to Clarine, the plump, brown-cheeked
woman who trained dogs; she looked undersized beside him. Latelle, who performed with the bears,
was a stern-faced, dark-eyed woman with short black hair and the beginnings of a sneer permanently
on her lips. Aludra, the slender woman who was supposed to be an Illuminator, might even have been
one. She did not wear her dark hair in Taraboner braids, not surprising given the feelings in
Amadicia, but she had the proper accents, and who could say what had happened to the Guild of
Illuminators? Their chapter house in Tanchico had certainly closed its doors. The acrobats, on the
other hand, claimed to be brothers named Chavana, but though they were all short, compact men, they
ranged in coloring from green-eyed Taeric—his high cheekbones and hooked nose proclaiming
Saldaean blood—to Barit, who was darker than Juilin and had Sea Folk tattoos on his hands, though
he wore no earrings or nose rings.
All but Latelle greeted the newcomers warmly; more performers meant more people attracted to
the show, and more money. The two jugglers, Bari and Kin—they really were brothers, it turned out

—engaged Thom in talk of their trade, once they found out that he did not work the same way they did.
Drawing more people was one thing, competition another. Yet it was the pale-haired woman who
cared for the boar-horses who attracted Nynaeve’s immediate interest. Cerandin stood stiffly on the
fringes and barely spoke—Luca claimed she had come from Shara with the animals—but her soft,
slurred manner of speech made Nynaeve’s ears go to points.
It took a little time to get their wagon in place. Thom and Juilin seemed more than pleased to
have the horse handlers’ help with the team, sullenly as it was given, and invitations were given to
Nynaeve and Elayne. Petra and Clarine asked them to have tea once they were settled. The Chavanas
wanted the two women to have supper with them, and Kin and Bari did, too, all of which made
Latelle’s sneer become a scowl. Those invitations they declined gracefully, Elayne perhaps a bit
more so than Nynaeve; the memory of herself goggling at Galad like a frog-eyed girl was too fresh for
her to be more than minimally polite to any man. Luca had his own invitation, for Elayne alone,
spoken where Nynaeve could not hear. It earned him a slapped face, and Thom ostentatiously flashed
knives that seemed to roll across his hands until the man went away growling to himself and rubbing
his cheek.
Leaving Elayne putting her things away in the wagon—throwing them, really, and muttering to
herself furiously—Nynaeve went off to where the boar-horses were hobbled. The huge gray animals
seemed placid enough, but remembering that hole in the stone wall of The King’s Lancer, she was not
too sure about the leather cords connecting their massive front legs. Cerandin was scratching the big
male with her bronze-hooked goad.
“What are they really called?” Diffidently, Nynaeve patted the male’s long nose, or snout, or
whatever it was. Those tusks were as big around as her leg and a good three paces long, and only a
little larger than the female’s at that. The snout snuffled at her skirt and she stepped back hastily.
“S’redit,” the pale-haired woman said. “They are s’redit, but Master Luca thought a name more
easily said was better.” That drawling accent was unmistakable.
“Are there many s’redit in Seanchan?”
The goad stopped moving for an instant, then resumed scratching. “Seanchan? Where is that? The
s’redit are from Shara, as I am. I have never heard of—”
“Perhaps you’ve seen Shara, Cerandin, but I doubt it. You are Seanchan. Unless I miss my guess,
you were part of the invasion on Toman Head, left behind after Falme.”
“There is no doubt,” Elayne said, stepping up beside her. “We heard Seanchan accents in Falme,
Cerandin. We will not hurt you.”
That was more than Nynaeve was willing to promise; her memories of the Seanchan were not
fond ones. And yet . . . A Seanchan helped you when you needed it. They are not all evil. Only most
of them.
Cerandin let out a long sigh, and sagged a little. It was as if a tension so old that she was no
longer aware of it had gone. “Very few people I have met know anything approaching the truth of The
Return, or Falme. I have heard a hundred tales, each more fanciful than the last, but never the truth. As
well for me. I was left behind, and many of the s’redit, also. These three were all I could gather. I do
not know what happened to the rest. The bull is Mer, the cow Sanit, and the calf Nerin. She is not
Sanit’s.”
“Is that what you did?” Elayne asked. “Train s’redit?”
“Or were you a sul’dam?” Nynaeve added before the other woman could speak.
Cerandin shook her head. “I was tested, as all girls are, but I could do nothing with the a’dam. I
was glad to be chosen to work with s’redit. They are magnificent animals. You know a great deal, to

know of sul’dam and damane. I have encountered no one before who knows of them.” She showed no
fear. Or perhaps it had been used up since finding herself abandoned in a strange land. Then again,
maybe she was lying.
The Seanchan were as bad as Amadicians when it came to women who could channel, perhaps
worse. They did not exile or kill; they imprisoned and used. By means of a device called an a’dam—
Nynaeve was sure it must be a sort of ter’angreal—a woman who had the ability to wield the One
Power could be controlled by another woman, a sul’dam, who forced the damane to use her talents
for whatever the Seanchan wanted, even as a weapon. A damane was no better than an animal, if a
well-tended one. And they made damane of every last woman found with the ability to channel or the
spark born in her; the Seanchan had scoured Toman Head more thoroughly than the Tower had ever
dreamed of. The mere thought of a’dam and sul’dam and damane made Nynaeve’s stomach churn.
“We know a little,” she told Cerandin, “but we want to know more.” The Seanchan were gone,
driven away by Rand, but that was not to say they would not return one day. It was a distant danger
beside everything else they had to face, yet just because you had a thorn in your foot did not mean that
a briar scratch on your arm would not fester eventually. “You would do well to answer our questions
truthfully.” There would be time on the journey north.
“I promise that nothing will happen to you,” Elayne added. “I will protect you, if need be.”
The pale-haired woman’s eyes shifted from one of them to the other, and suddenly, to Nynaeve’s
amazement, she prostrated herself on the ground in front of Elayne. “You are a High Lady of this land,
just as you told Luca. I did not realize. Forgive me, High Lady. I submit myself to you.” And she
kissed the ground in front of Elayne’s feet. Elayne’s eyes looked ready to leap out of her face.
Nynaeve was sure she was no better. “Get up,” she hissed, looking around frantically to see if
anyone was watching. Luca was—curse him!—and Latrelle, still wearing that scowl, but there was
nothing to be done. “Get up!” The woman did not stir.
“Stand on your feet, Cerandin,” Elayne said. “No one requires people to behave that way in this
land. Not even a ruler.” As Cerandin scrambled erect, she added, “I will teach you the proper way to
behave in return for your answers to our questions.”
The woman bowed, hands on her knees and head down. “Yes, High Lady. It will be as you say. I
am yours.”
Nynaeve sighed heavily. They were going to have a fine time traveling to Ghealdan.

CHAPTER

A Hound of Darkness

Liandrin guided her horse through the crowded streets of Amador, the sneer on her rosebud
lips hidden by her deep, curving bonnet. She had hated to give up her multitude of braids, and hated
even more the ludicrous fashions of this ludicrous land; the reddish yellow of hat and riding dress she
rather liked, but not the large velvet bows on both. Still, the bonnet hid her eyes—combined with
honey-yellow hair, brown eyes would have named her Taraboner in an instant, not a good thing in
Amadicia just now—and it hid what would have been even worse to show here, an Aes Sedai’s face.
Safely hidden, she could smirk at the Whitecloaks, who seemed to be every fifth man in the streets.
Not that the soldiers who made another fifth would have been any better. None of them ever thought to
look inside the bonnet, of course. Aes Sedai were outlawed here, and that meant there were none.
Even so, she felt a little better when she turned in at the elaborate iron gates in front of Jorin
Arene’s house. Another fruitless trip looking for word from the White Tower; there had been nothing
since she had learned that Elaida thought she was in control of the Tower, and that the Sanche woman
had been disposed of. Siuan had escaped, true, but she was a useless rag now.
The gardens behind the gray stone fence were full of plants going rather brown from lack of rain,
but trimmed and trained into cubes and balls, though one was shaped like a leaping horse. Only one,
of course. Merchants like Arene mimicked their betters, but they dared not go too far lest someone
think their conceit too high. Elaborate balconies decorated the large wooden house with its red-tiled
roofs, and even a colonnade of carved columns, but unlike the lord’s dwelling it was meant to copy, it
stood on a stone foundation no more than ten feet tall. A childish pretense at a noble’s manor.
The stringy, gray-haired man who scurried out deferentially to hold her stirrup while she
dismounted, and take her reins, was clad all in black. Whatever colors a merchant chose for livery,
they were sure to be some real lord’s colors, and even a minor lord could cause trouble for the
richest seller of goods. People in the streets called black “merchant’s livery,” and snickered when
they said it. Liandrin despised the groom’s black coat as much as she did Arene’s house and Arene
himself. She would have true manors, one day. Palaces. They had been promised to her, and the
power that went with them.
Stripping off her riding gloves, she stalked up the ridiculous ramp that slanted along the
foundations to the vine-carved front doors. The lords’ fortress manors had ramps, so of course a
merchant who thought well of himself could not have steps. A black-clad young serving girl took
gloves and hat in the round entrance hall, with its many doors and carved and brightly painted
columns and its encircling balcony. The ceiling was lacquered in imitation of a mosaic, stars within
stars in gold and black. “I will have my bath in one hour,” she told the woman. “It will be the proper
temperature this time, yes?” The maid went pale as she curtsied, stammering agreement before

scurrying away.
Amellia Arene, Jorin’s wife, came through one of the doors deep in conversation with a fat
balding man in a spotless white apron. Liandrin breathed contemptuously. The woman had
pretensions, yet she not only spoke to the cook herself, she brought the man out of his kitchens to
discuss meals. She treated the servant like—like a friend!
Fat Evon saw her first and gulped, his piggy eyes darting away immediately. She did not like
men looking at her, and she had spoken sharply to him on her first day here about the way his gaze
sometimes lingered. He had tried to deny it, but she knew men’s vile habits. Without waiting to be
dismissed by his mistress, Evon all but ran back the way he had come.
The graying merchant’s wife had been a stern-faced woman when Liandrin and the others came.
Now she licked her lips and smoothed her bow-draped green silk needlessly. “There is someone
upstairs with the others, my Lady,” she said diffidently. She had thought that she could use Liandrin’s
name that first day. “In the front withdrawing room. From Tar Valon, I believe.”
Wondering who it could be, Liandrin started for the nearest of the curving staircases. She knew
few others of the Black Ajah, of course, for safety’s sake; what others did not know, they could not
betray. In the Tower she had known only one of the twelve who went with her when she left. Two of
the twelve were dead, and she knew at whose feet to lay the blame. Egwene al’Vere, Nynaeve
al’Meara, and Elayne Trakand. Everything had gone so badly in Tanchico that she would have thought
those three upstart Accepted had been there, except that they were fools who had twice walked
tamely into traps she had set. That they had escaped each was of no consequence. Had they been in
Tanchico, they would have fallen into her hands, whatever Jeaine claimed to have seen. The next time
she found them, they would never escape anything again. She would be done with them whatever her
orders.
“My Lady,” Amellia stammered. “My husband, my Lady. Jorin. Please, will one of you help
him? He did not mean it, my Lady. He has learned his lesson.”
Liandrin paused with one hand on the carved banister, looking back over her shoulder. “He
should not have thought that his oaths to the Great Lord could be conveniently forgotten, no?”
“He has learned, my Lady. Please. He lies beneath blankets all day—in this heat—shivering. He
weeps when anyone touches him, or speaks above a whisper.”
Liandrin paused as if considering, then nodded graciously. “I will ask Chesmal to see what she
can do. Yet you understand that I make no promises.” The woman’s unsteady thanks followed her up,
but she paid them no mind. Temaile had let herself be carried away. She had been Gray Ajah before
becoming Black, and she always made a point of spreading the pain evenly when she mediated; she
had been very successful as a mediator, for she liked spreading pain. Chesmal said he might be able
to do small tasks in a few months, so long as they were not too hard and no one raised a voice. She
had been one of the best Healers in generations among the Yellow, so she should know.
The front withdrawing room startled her when she went in. Nine of the ten Black sisters who had
come with her stood around the room against the carved and painted paneling, though there were
plenty of silk-cushioned chairs on the gold-fringed carpet. The tenth, Temaile Kinderode, was
handing a delicate porcelain cup of tea to a dark-haired, sturdily handsome woman in a bronzecolored gown of unfamiliar cut. The seated woman looked vaguely familiar, though she was not Aes
Sedai; she was plainly approaching her middle years, and despite smooth cheeks there was nothing of
agelessness about her.
Yet the mood made Liandrin cautious. Temaile was deceptively fragile in appearance, with big,
childlike blue eyes that made people trust her; those eyes appeared worried now, or uneasy, and the

teacup rattled on the saucer before the other woman took it. Every face looked uneasy, except that of
the oddly familiar woman. Coppery-skinned Jeaine Caide, in one of those disgusting Domani
garments that she wore inside the house, had tears still glistening on her cheeks; she had been a
Green, and liked flaunting herself in front of men even more than most Greens. Rianna Andomeran,
once White and always a coldly arrogant killer, nervously kept touching the pale streak in her black
hair above her left ear. Her arrogance had been flattened.
“What has happened here?” Liandrin demanded. “Who are you, and what—?” Suddenly the
memory flashed into her head. A Darkfriend, a servant in Tanchico who had continually gotten above
herself. “Gyldin!” she snapped. This servant had followed them in some fashion and obviously was
trying to pass herself off as a Black courier with some dire news. “You have overstepped yourself
too far this time.” She reached to embrace saidar, yet even as she did the glow surrounded the other
woman, and Liandrin’s reach ran into a thick invisible wall shutting her away from the Source. It hung
there like the sun, tantalizingly out of reach.
“Stop gaping, Liandrin,” the woman said calmly. “You look like a fish. It is not Gyldin, but
Moghedien. This tea needs more honey, Temaile.” The slender, fox-faced woman darted to take the
cup, breathing heavily.
It had to be so. Who else could have so cowed the others? Liandrin looked at them standing
around the walls. Round-faced Eldrith Jhondar, for once not looking vague at all despite an ink
smudge on her nose, nodded vigorously. The others seemed afraid to twitch. Why one of the Forsaken
—they were not supposed to use that name, but usually did, among themselves—why Moghedien
would have masqueraded as a servant, she could not understand. The woman had or could have
everything that she herself wanted. Not just knowledge of the One Power beyond her dreams, but
power. Power over others, power over the world. And immortality. Power for a lifetime that would
never end. She and her sisters had speculated on dissension among the Forsaken; there had been
orders at odds with each other, and orders given to other Darkfriends at odds with theirs. Perhaps
Moghedien had been hiding from the rest of the Forsaken.
Liandrin spread her divided riding skirts as best she could in a deep curtsy. “We welcome you,
Great Mistress. With the Chosen to lead us, we shall surely triumph before the Day of the Great
Lord’s Return.”
“Nicely said,” Moghedien said dryly, taking the cup back from Temaile. “Yes, this is much
better.” Temaile looked absurdly grateful, and relieved. What had Moghedien done?
Suddenly a thought came to Liandrin, an unwelcome one. She had treated one of the Chosen as a
servant. “Great Mistress, in Tanchico I did not know that you—”
“Of course you did not,” Moghedien said irritably. “What good to bide my time in the shadows
if you and these others knew me?” Abruptly a small smile appeared on her lips; it touched nothing
else. “Are you worried about those times you sent Gyldin to the cook to be beaten?” Sweat beaded
suddenly on Liandrin’s face. “Do you truly believe I would allow such a thing? The man no doubt
reported to you, but he remembered what I wanted him to remember. He actually felt sorry for Gyldin,
so cruelly treated by her mistress.” That seemed to amuse her greatly. “He gave me some of the
desserts that he made for you. It would not displease me if he still lives.”
Liandrin drew a relieved breath. She would not die. “Great Mistress, there is no need to shield
me. I also serve the Great Lord. I swore my oaths as a Darkfriend before ever I went to the White
Tower. I sought the Black Ajah from the day that I knew that I could channel.”
“So you will be the only one in this ill-ordered pack who does not need to learn who her
mistress is?” Moghedien quirked an eyebrow. “I would not have thought it of you.” The glow around

her vanished. “I have tasks for you. For all of you. Whatever you have been doing, you will forget.
You are an inept lot, as you proved in Tanchico. With my hand on the dog whip, perhaps you will
hunt more successfully.”
“We await orders from the Tower, Great Mistress,” Liandrin said. Inept! They had almost found
what they were hunting for in Tanchico, when the city exploded in riots; they had barely escaped
destruction at the hands of Aes Sedai who had somehow wandered into the middle of their plan. Had
Moghedien revealed herself, or even taken part on their behalf, they would have triumphed. If their
failure was anyone’s fault, it was Moghedien’s herself. Liandrin reached toward the True Source, not
to embrace it, but to be certain that the shield had not merely been tied off. It was gone. “We have
been given great responsibilities, great works to perform, and surely we will be commanded to
continue—”
Moghedien cut her off sharply. “You serve whichever of the Chosen chooses to snap you up.
Whoever sends you orders from the White Tower, she takes her own from one of us now, and very
likely grovels on her belly when she does. You will serve me, Liandrin. Be sure of it.”
Moghedien did not know who headed the Black Ajah. It was a revelation. Moghedien did not
know everything. Liandrin had always imagined the Forsaken as close to omnipotent, something far
beyond ordinary mortals. Perhaps the woman truly was in flight from the other Forsaken. To hand her
over to them would surely earn her a high place. She might even become one of them. She had a trick,
learned in childhood. And she could touch the Source. “Great Mistress, we serve the Great Lord, as
you do. We also were promised eternal life, and power, when the Great Lord re—”
“Do you think that you are my equal, little sister?” Moghedien grimaced in disgust. “Did you
stand in the Pit of Doom to dedicate your soul to the Great Lord? Did you taste the sweetness of
victory at Paaran Disen, or the bitter ashes at the Asar Don? You are a barely trained puppy, not the
packmistress, and you will go where I point until I see fit to give you a better place. These others
thought themselves more than they are, too. Do you wish to try your strength against me?”
“Of course not, Great Mistress.” Not when she was forewarned and ready. “I—”
“You will do so sooner or later, and I prefer to put it out of the way now, in the beginning. Why
do you think your companions look so cheerful? I have taught each of them the same lesson already
today. I will not wonder when you must be taught, too. I will be done with it now. Try.”
Licking her lips fearfully, Liandrin looked around at the women standing rigidly against the
walls. Only Asne Zeramene so much as blinked; she shook her head ever so slightly. Asne’s tilted
eyes, high cheekbones and strong nose marked her Saldaean, and she had all the vaunted Saldaean
boldness. If she counseled against, if her dark eyes held a tinge of fear, then it was surely best to
grovel however much was needed to make Moghedien relent. And yet, there was her trick.
She went to her knees, head low, looking up at the Forsaken with a fear that was only partly
feigned. Moghedien lounged in her chair, sipping the tea. “Great Mistress, I beg you to forgive me if I
have presumed. I know that I am but a worm beneath your foot. I beg, as one who would be your
faithful hound, for your mercy on this wretched dog.” Moghedien’s eyes dropped to her cup, and in a
flash, while the words still tumbled from her mouth, Liandrin embraced the Source and channeled,
seeking the crack that must be in the Forsaken’s confidence, the crack that was in everyone’s façade
of strength.
Even as she lashed out, the light of saidar surrounded the other woman, and pain enveloped
Liandrin. She crumpled to the carpet, trying to howl, but agony beyond anything she had ever known
silenced her gaping mouth. Her eyes were going to burst from her head; her skin was going to peel
away in strips. For an eternity she thrashed, and when it vanished as suddenly as it had begun, all she

could do was lie there, shuddering and weeping open-mouthed.
“Do you begin to see?” Moghedien said calmly, handing the empty cup to Temaile with, “That
was very good. But next time a little stronger.” Temaile looked as though she might faint. “You are
not quick enough, Liandrin, you are not strong enough, and you do not know enough. That pitiful little
thing you tried against me. Would you like to see what it is really like?” She channeled.
Liandrin gazed up at her adoringly. Crawling across the floor, she pushed words through the
sobs she still could not stop. “Forgive me, Great Mistress.” This magnificent woman, like a star in the
heavens, a comet, above all kings and queens in wonder. “Forgive, please,” she begged, pressing
kisses against the hem of Moghedien’s skirt as she babbled. “Forgive. I am a dog, a worm.” It shamed
her to her core that she had not meant those things before. They were true. Before this woman, they
were all true. “Let me serve you, Great Mistress. Allow me to serve. Please. Please.”
“I am not Graendal,” Moghedien said, pushing her away roughly with one velvet-slippered foot.
Suddenly the sense of worship was gone. Lying there in a heap, weeping, Liandrin could
remember it clearly, though. She stared at the Forsaken in horror.
“Are you convinced yet, Liandrin?”
“Yes, Great Mistress,” she managed. She was. Convinced that she dared not even think of trying
again until she was certain of success. Her trick was only the palest shadow of what Moghedien had
done. Could she but learn that . . .
“We shall see. I think you may be one of those who needs a second lesson. Pray it is not so,
Liandrin; I make second lessons exceedingly sharp. Now take your place with the others. You will
find that I have taken some of the objects of power that you had in your room, but you may keep the
trinkets that remain. Am I not kind?”
“The Great Mistress is kind,” Liandrin agreed around hiccoughs and occasional sobs that she
could not stifle.
Limply she staggered to her feet and went to stand beside Asne; the wall panel against her back
helped to hold her upright. She saw the flows of Air being woven; only Air, but she still flinched as
they bound her mouth shut and stopped sound from her ears. She certainly did not try to resist. She did
not even let herself think of saidar. Who knew what one of the Forsaken could do? Perhaps read her
thoughts. That almost made her run. No. If Moghedien knew her thoughts, she would be dead by now.
Or still screaming on the floor. Or kissing Moghedien’s feet and begging to serve. Liandrin shivered
uncontrollably; if that weave had not bound her mouth, her teeth would have been chattering.
Moghedien wove the same around all of them save Rianna, whom the Forsaken beckoned with
an imperious finger to kneel before her. Then Rianna left, and Marillin Gemalphin was unbound and
summoned.
From where she stood, Liandrin could see their faces even if their mouths moved soundlessly for
her. Plainly each woman was receiving orders the others knew nothing of. The faces told little,
though. Rianna merely listened, a touch of relief in her eyes, bowed her head in assent and went.
Marillin looked surprised, and then eager, but she had been a Brown, and Browns could be
enthusiastic over anything that allowed them a chance to unearth some moldy bit of lost knowledge.
Jeaine Caide donned a slow mask of horror, shaking her head at first and trying to cover herself and
that disgustingly sheer gown, but Moghedien’s face hardened, and Jeaine nodded hurriedly and fled, if
not as eagerly as Marillin, just as quickly. Berylla Naron, lean almost to scrawniness and as fine a
manipulator and plotter as there was, and Falion Bhoda, long-faced and cold despite her obvious
fear, showed as little expression as Rianna had. Ispan Shefar, like Liandrin from Tarabon, though
dark-haired, actually kissed Moghedien’s hem before she rose.

Then the flows were unwoven around Liandrin. She thought that it was her turn to be sent away
on the Shadow knew what errand, until she saw the bonds dispelled around the others remaining as
well. Moghedien’s finger beckoned peremptorily, and Liandrin knelt between Asne and Chesmal
Emry, a tall, handsome woman, dark-haired and dark-eyed. Chesmal, once Yellow, could Heal or kill
with equal ease, but the intensity of her gaze on Moghedien, the way her hands trembled as they
clutched her skirts, said she intended only to obey.
She would have to go by such signs, Liandrin realized. Approaching one of the others with her
belief that rewards could be had for handing Moghedien to the rest of the Forsaken might well be
disastrous if the one she spoke to had decided that it was in her best interests to be Moghedien’s
lapdog. She almost whimpered at the thought of a “second lesson.”
“You, I keep with me,” the Forsaken said, “for the most important task. What the others do may
bear sweet fruit, but to me yours will be the most important harvest. A personal harvest. There is a
woman named Nynaeve al’Meara.” Liandrin’s head came up, and Moghedien’s dark eyes sharpened.
“You know of her?”
“I despise her,” Liandrin replied truthfully. “She is a filthy wilder who ought never to have been
allowed in the Tower.” She loathed all wilders. Dreaming of being Black Ajah, she herself had begun
learning to channel a full year before going to the Tower, but she was in no way a wilder.
“Very good. You five are going to find her for me. I want her alive. Oh, yes, I do want her
alive.” Moghedien’s smile made Liandrin shiver; giving Nynaeve and the other two to her might be
entirely suitable. “The day before yesterday she was in a village called Sienda, perhaps sixty miles
east of here, with another young woman in whom I may be interested, but they have vanished. You
will . . .”
Liandrin listened eagerly. For this, she could be a faithful hound. For the other, she would wait
patiently.

CHAPTER
19

Memories

“My Queen?”
Morgase looked up from the book on her lap. Sunlight slanted through the window of the sitting
room next to her bedchamber. The day was already hot, with no breeze, and sweat dampened her
face. It would be noon before much longer, and she had not stirred from the room. That was unlike
her; she could not remember why she had decided to laze the morning away with a book. She seemed
unable to concentrate on reading of late. By the golden clock on the mantel above the marble
fireplace, an hour had passed since she last turned a page, and she could not recall its words. It must
be the heat.
The red-coated young officer of her Guards, kneeling with one fist pressed to the red-and-gold
carpet, looked vaguely familiar. Once she had known the name of every Guard assigned to the Palace.
Perhaps it was all the new faces. “Tallanvor,” she said, surprising herself. He was a tall, well-made
young man, but she could not tell why she remembered him in particular. Had he brought someone to
her once? Long ago? “Guardsman Lieutenant Martyn Tallanvor.”
He glanced at her, startlingly rough-eyed, before putting his gaze back on the carpet. “My Queen,
forgive me, but I am surprised that you remain here, given the morning’s news.”
“What news?” It would be good to learn something besides Alteima’s gossip of the Tairen court.
At times she felt that there was something else she wanted to ask the woman, but all they ever did was
gossip, which she could never remember doing before. Gaebril seemed to enjoy listening to them,
sitting in that tall chair in front of the fireplace with his ankles crossed, smiling contentedly. Alteima
had taken to wearing rather daring dresses; Morgase would have to say something to her. Dimly she
seemed to remember thinking that before. Nonsense. If I had, I would have spoken to her already.
She shook her head, realizing that she had drifted away from the young officer entirely, that he had
begun speaking and stopped when he saw she was not listening. “Tell me again. I was distracted. And
stand.”
He rose, face angry, eyes burning on her before they dropped again. She looked where he had
been staring and blushed; her dress was cut extremely low. But Gaebril liked her to wear them so.
With that thought she ceased fretting about being nearly naked in front of one of her officers.
“Be brief,” she said curtly. How dare he look at me in that manner? I should have him flogged.
“What news is so important that you think you can walk into my sitting room as if it were a tavern?”
His face darkened, but whether from proper embarrassment or increased anger she could not say.
How dare he be angry with his queen! Does the man think all I have to do is listen to him?
“Rebellion, my Queen,” he said in a flat tone, and all thought of anger and stares vanished.
“Where?”
“The Two Rivers, my Queen. Someone has raised the old banner of Manetheren, the Red Eagle.

A messenger came from Whitebridge this morning.”
Morgase drummed her fingers on the book, her thoughts coming more clearly than it seemed they
had in a very long time. Something about the Two Rivers, some spark she could not quite fan to life,
tugged at her. The region was hardly part of Andor at all, and had not been for generations. She and
the last three queens before her had been hard pressed to maintain a modicum of control over the
miners and smelters in the Mountains of Mist, and even that modicum would have been lost had there
been any way to get the metals out save through the rest of Andor. A choice between holding the
mines’ gold and iron and other metals and keeping the Two Rivers’ wool and tabac had not been
difficult. But rebellion unchecked, even rebellion in a part of her realm that she ruled only on a map,
could spread like wildfire, to places that were hers in fact. And Manetheren, destroyed in the Trolloc
Wars, Manetheren of legend and story, still had a hold on some men’s minds. Besides, the Two
Rivers was hers. If they had been left to go their own way for far too long, they were still a part of her
realm.
“Has Lord Gaebril been informed?” Of course he had not. He would have come to her with the
news, and suggestions on how to deal with it. His suggestions were always clearly right.
Suggestions? Somehow, it seemed that she could remember him telling her what to do. That was
impossible, of course.
“He has, my Queen.” Tallanvor’s voice was still bland, unlike his face, where slow anger yet
smoldered. “He laughed. He said the Two Rivers seemed to throw up trouble, and he would have to
do something about it one day. He said this minor annoyance would have to wait its turn behind more
important matters.”
The book fell as she sprang to her feet, and she thought Tallanvor smiled in grim satisfaction as
she swept by him. A serving woman told her where Gaebril was to be found, and she marched
straight to the colonnaded court, with its marble fountain, the basin full of lily pads and fish: It was
cooler there, and shaded a little.
Gaebril sat on the broad white coping of the fountain, lords and ladies gathered around him. She
recognized fewer than half. Dark square-faced Jarid of House Sarand, and his shrewish honey-haired
wife, Elenia. That simpering Arymilla of House Marne, melting brown eyes always so wide in
feigned interest, and bony, goat-faced Nasin of House Caeren, who would tumble any woman he
could corner despite his thin white hair. Naean of House Arawn, as usual with a sneer marring her
pale beauty, and Lir of House Baryn, a whip of a man, wearing a sword of all things, and Karind of
House Anshar, with the same flat-eyed stare that some said had put three husbands under the ground.
The others she did not know at all, which was strange enough, but these she never allowed into the
Palace except on state occasions. Every one had opposed her during the Succession. Elenia and
Naean had wanted the Lion Throne for themselves. What could Gaebril be thinking to actually bring
them here?
“. . . the size of our estates in Cairhien, my Lord,” Arymilla was saying, leaning over Gaebril, as
Morgase approached. None of them more than glanced at her. As if she were a servant with the wine!
“I want to speak with you concerning the Two Rivers, Gaebril. In private.”
“It has been dealt with, my dear,” he said idly, dabbling his fingers in the water. “Other matters
concern me now. I thought you were going to read during the heat of the day. You should return to
your room until the evening’s coolness, such as it is.”
My dear. He had called her “my dear” in front of these interlopers! As much as she thrilled to
hear that on his lips when they were alone . . . Elenia was hiding her mouth. “I think not, Lord
Gaebril,” Morgase said coldly. “You will come with me now. And these others will be out of the

Palace before I return, or I will exile them from Caemlyn completely.”
Suddenly he was on his feet, a big man, towering over her. She seemed unable to look at
anything but his dark eyes; her skin tingled as if an icy wind were blowing through the courtyard.
“You will go and wait for me, Morgase.” His voice was a distant roar filling her ears. “I have dealt
with all that needs dealing with. I will come to you this evening. You will go now. You will go.”
She had one hand lifted to open the door of her sitting room before she realized where she was.
And what had happened. He had told her to go, and she had gone. Staring at the door in horror, she
could see the smirks on the men’s faces, open laughter on some of the women’s. What has happened
to me? How could I become so besotted with any man? She still felt the urge to enter, and wait for
him.
Dazed, she forced herself to turn and walk away. It was an effort. Inside, she cringed at the idea
of Gaebril’s disappointment in her when he did not find her where he expected, and cringed further at
recognizing the fawning thought.
At first she had no notion of where she was going or why, only that she would not wait
obediently, not for Gaebril, not for any man or woman in the world. The fountained courtyard kept
repeating in her head, him telling her to go, and those hateful, amused faces watching. Her mind still
seemed fogged. She could not comprehend how or why she could have let it happen. She had to think
of something that she could understand, something she could deal with. Jarid Sarand and the others.
When she assumed the throne she had pardoned them for everything they had done during the
Succession, as she had pardoned everyone who opposed her. It had seemed best to bury all
animosities before they could fester into the sort of plotting and scheming that infected so many lands.
The Game of Houses it was called—Daes Dae’mar—or the Great Game, and it led to endless,
tangled feuds between Houses, to the toppling of rulers; the Game was at the heart of the civil war in
Cairhien, and no doubt had done its part in the turmoil enveloping Arad Doman and Tarabon. The
pardons had had to go to all to stop Daes Dae’mar being born in Andor, but could she have left any
unsigned, they would have been the parchments with those seven’s names.
Gaebril knew that. Publicly she had shown no disfavor, but in private she had been willing to
speak of her distrust. They had had to pry their jaws open to swear fealty, and she could hear the lie
on their tongues. Any one would leap at a chance to pull her down, and all seven together . . .
There was only one conclusion she could reach. Gaebril must be plotting against her. It could not
be to put Elenia or Naean on the throne. Not when he has me already, she thought bitterly, behaving
like his lapdog. He must mean to supplant her himself. To become the first king that Andor had ever
had. And she still felt the desire to return to her book and wait for him. She still ached for his touch.
It was not until she saw the aged faces in the hallway around her, the creased cheeks and often
bent backs, that she became aware of where she was. The Pensioners’ Quarters. Some servants
returned to their families when they grew old, but others had been so long in the Palace that they
could think of no other life. Here they had their own small apartments, their own shaded garden and a
spacious courtyard. Like every queen before her, she supplemented their pensions by letting them buy
food through the Palace kitchens for less than its cost, and the infirmary treated their ills. Creaky
bows and unsteady curtsies followed her, and murmurs of “The Light shine upon you, my Queen,” and
“The Light bless you, my Queen,” and “The Light protect you, my Queen.” She acknowledged them
absently. She knew where she was going now.
Lini’s door was like all the others along the green-tiled corridor, unadorned save for a carving
of the rearing Lion of Andor. She never thought of knocking before entering; she was the Queen, and
this was her Palace. Her old nurse was not there, though a teakettle steaming over a small fire in the

brick fireplace said she would not be long.
The two snug rooms were neatly furnished, the bed made to perfection, the two chairs precisely
aligned at the table, where a blue vase in the exact center held a small fan of greenery. Lini had
always been a great one for neatness. Morgase was willing to wager that within the wardrobe in the
bedchamber every dress was arranged just so with every other, and the same for pots in the cupboard
beside the fireplace in the other room.
Six painted ivory miniatures in small wooden stands made a line on the mantelpiece. How Lini
could have afforded them on a nurse’s stipend was more than Morgase had ever been able to imagine;
she could not ask such a question, of course. In pairs, they showed three young women and the same
three as babes. Elayne was there, and herself. Taking down the portrait of herself at fourteen, a
slender filly of a girl, she could not believe that she had ever looked so innocent. She had worn that
ivory silk dress the day she had gone to the White Tower, never dreaming at the time that she would
be Queen, only harboring the vain hope that she might become Aes Sedai.
Absentmindedly she thumbed the Great Serpent ring on her left hand. She had not earned that,
precisely; women who could not channel were not awarded the ring. But short of her sixteenth
nameday she had returned to contest the Rose Crown in the name of House Trakand, and when she
won the throne nearly two years later, the ring had been presented to her. By tradition, the DaughterHeir of Andor always trained in the Tower, and in recognition of Andor’s long support of the Tower
was given the ring whether or not she could channel. She had only been the heir to House Trakand in
the Tower, but they gave it to her anyway once the Rose Crown was on her head.
Replacing her own portrait, she took down her mother’s, taken at perhaps two years older. Lini
had been nurse to three generations of Trakand women. Maighdin Trakand had been beautiful.
Morgase could remember that smile, when it had become a mother’s loving beam. It was Maighdin
who should have had the Lion Throne. But a fever had carried her away, and a young girl had found
herself High Seat of House Trakand, in the middle of a struggle for the throne with no more support in
the beginning than her House retainers and the House bard. I won the Lion Throne. I will not give it
up, and I will not see a man take it. For a thousand years a queen has ruled Andor, and I will not
let that end now!
“Meddling in my things again, are you, child?”
That voice triggered long-forgotten reflexes. Morgase had the miniature hidden behind her back
before she knew it. With a rueful shake of her head she put the portrait back on its stand. “I am not a
girl in the nursery any longer, Lini. You must remember that, or one day you will say something where
I must do something about it.”
“My neck is scrawny and old,” Lini said, setting a net bag of carrots and turnips on the table. She
looked frail in her neat gray dress, her white hair drawn back in a bun from a narrow face with skin
like thin parchment, but her back was straight, her voice clear and steady, and her dark eyes as sharp
as ever. “If you want to give it to hangman or headsman, I am almost done with it anyway. ‘A gnarled
old branch dulls the blade that severs a sapling.’ ”
Morgase sighed. Lini would never change. She would not curtsy if the entire court were
watching. “You do grow tougher as you grow older. I am not certain a headsman could find an axe
sharp enough for your neck.”
“You’ve not been to see me in some time, so I suppose there’s something you need to work out
in your mind. When you were in the nursery—and later—you always used to come to me when you
couldn’t work matters out. Shall I make a pot of tea?”
“Some time, Lini? I visit you every week, and a wonder I do, given how you speak to me. I

would exile the highest lady in Andor if she said half what you do.”
Lini gave her a level look. “You have not darkened my doorway since the spring. And I talk as I
always have; I’m too old to change now. Do you want tea?”
“No.” Morgase put a hand to her head in confusion. She did visit Lini every week. She could
remember. . . . She could not remember. Gaebril had filled her hours so completely that sometimes it
was hard to remember anything other than him. “No, I do not want tea. I do not know why I came. You
cannot help me with the problem I have.”
Her old nurse snorted, though somehow she made it a delicate sound. “Your trouble is with
Gaebril, isn’t it? Only now you’re ashamed to tell me. Girl, I changed you in your cradle, tended you
when you were sick and heaving your stomach up, and told you what you needed to know about men.
You have never been too shamed to discuss anything with me, and now is no time to begin.”
“Gaebril?” Morgase’s eyes widened. “You know? But how?”
“Oh, child,” Lini said sadly, “everyone knows, though no one’s had the courage to tell you. I
might have, if you hadn’t stayed away, but it is hardly something I could go running to you with, now
is it? It is the kind of thing a woman won’t believe until she finds out for herself.”
“What are you talking about?” Morgase demanded. “It was your duty to come to me if you knew,
Lini. It was everyone’s duty! Light, I am the last to know, and now it may be too late to stop it!”
“Too late?” Lini said incredulously. “Why should it be too late? You bundle Gaebril out of the
Palace, out of Andor, and Alteima and the others with him, and it is done with. Too late, indeed.”
For a moment Morgase could not speak. “Alteima,” she said finally, “and . . . the others?”
Lini stared at her, then shook her head in disgust. “I am an old fool; my wits are dryrooted. Well,
you know now. ‘When the honey’s out of the comb, there’s no putting it back.’ ” Her voice became
gentler and at the same time brisk, the voice she had used for telling Morgase that her pony had
broken a leg and had to be put down. “Gaebril spends most of his nights with you, but Alteima has
nearly as much of his time. He spreads himself thin with the other six. Five have rooms in the Palace.
One, a big-eyed young thing, he sneaks in and out for some reason all swathed in a cloak, even in this
heat. Perhaps she has a husband. I’m sorry, girl, but truth is truth. ‘Better to face the bear than run
from it.’ ”
Morgase’s knees sagged, and if Lini had not hurriedly pulled a chair from the table to shove
under her, she would have sat down on the floor. Alteima. Him watching the two of them as they
gossiped took on a new image, now. A man fondly watching two of his pet cats at play. And six
others! Rage boiled up in her, a rage that had been lacking when she only thought he was after her
throne. That she had considered coldly, clearly; as clearly as she could consider anything recently.
That was a danger that had to be looked at with cold reason. But this! The man had ensconced his
jades in her palace. He had made her just another of his trulls. She wanted his head. She wanted him
flayed alive. The Light help her, she wanted his touch. I must be going mad!
“That will be solved along with everything else,” she said coldly. Much depended on who was
in Caemlyn, and who on their country estates. “Where is Lord Pelivar? Lord Abelle? Lady
Arathelle?” They led strong Houses, and many retainers.
“Exiled,” Lini said slowly, giving her an odd look. “You exiled them from the city last spring.”
Morgase stared back. She remembered none of that. Except that now, dim and distant, she did.
“Lady Ellorien?” she said slowly. “Lady Aemlyn, and Lord Luan?” More strong Houses. More
Houses that had been behind her before she gained the throne.
“Exiled,” Lini replied just as slowly. “You had Ellorien flogged for demanding to know why.”
She bent to brush Morgase’s hair back, gnarled fingers lingering on her cheek as they had when she

checked for fever. “Are you well, girl?”
Morgase nodded dully, but it was because she was remembering, in a shadowy way. Ellorien,
screaming in outrage as her gown was ripped down the back. House Traemane had been the very first
to throw its support to Trakand, brought by a plumply pretty woman only a few years older than
Morgase. Brought by Ellorien, now one of her closest friends. At least, she had been. Elayne had
been named after Ellorien’s grandmother. Vaguely she could recall others leaving the city; distancing
themselves from her, it seemed obvious now. And those who remained? Houses too weak to be of any
use, or else sycophants. She seemed to recall signing numerous documents Gaebril had laid in front of
her, creating new titles. Gaebril’s toadeaters and her enemies; they were all she could count on being
strong in Caemlyn.
“I do not care what you say,” Lini said firmly. “You have no fever, but there’s something wrong.
You need an Aes Sedai Healer is what you need.”
“No Aes Sedai.” Morgase’s voice was even harder. She fingered her ring again, briefly. She
knew that her animosity toward the Tower had grown recently beyond what some might say was
reasonable, yet she could no longer make herself trust a White Tower that seemed to be trying to hide
her daughter from her. Her letter to the new Amyrlin demanding Elayne’s return—no one demanded
anything of an Amyrlin Seat, but she had—that letter was yet unanswered. It had barely had time to
reach Tar Valon. In any case, she knew for cold fact that she would not have an Aes Sedai near her.
And yet, right alongside that, she could not think of Elayne without a swell of pride. Raised Accepted
after so short a time. Elayne might well be the first woman to sit on the throne of Andor as full Aes
Sedai, not just Tower trained. It made no sense that she could feel both things at once, but very little
made any sense just now. And her daughter would never have the Lion Throne if Morgase did not
secure it for her.
“I said no Aes Sedai, Lini, so you might as well stop looking at me like that. This is one time you
will not make me take bad-tasting medicine. Besides which, I doubt there is an Aes Sedai of any
stripe to be found in Caemlyn.” Her old supporters gone, exiled by her own signature, and maybe her
enemies for good over what she had done to Ellorien. New lords and ladies in their places in the
Palace. New faces in the Guards. What loyalty remained there? “Would you recognize a Guardsman
Lieutenant named Tallanvor, Lini?” At the other woman’s quick nod, she went on. “Find him for me,
and bring him here. But do not let him know you are bringing him to me. In fact, tell everyone in the
Pensioners’ Quarters that, should anyone ask, I am not here.”
“There is more to this than Gaebril and his women, isn’t there?”
“Just go, Lini. And hurry. There is not much time.” By the shadows she could see in the treefilled garden through the window, the sun had passed its height. Evening would be there all too soon.
Evening, when Gaebril would be looking for her.
When Lini left, Morgase remained in the chair, sitting rigidly. She dared not stand; her knees
were stronger now, but she feared that if she began moving she would not stop until she was back in
her sitting room, waiting for Gaebril. The urge was that strong, especially now that she was alone.
And once he looked at her, once he touched her, she had no doubt that she would forgive him
everything. Forget everything, maybe, based on how fuzzy and incomplete her memories were. Had
she not known better, she could have thought that he had used the One Power on her in some way, but
no man who could channel survived to his age.
Lini had often told her that there was always one man in the world for whom a woman would
find herself behaving a brainless fool, but she had never believed that she could succumb. Still, her
choices in men had never been good, however right they seemed at the time.

Taringail Damodred she had wed for political reasons. He had been married to Tigraine, the
Daughter-Heir whose disappearance had set off the Succession when Mordrellen died. Marrying him
had made a link with the old queen, smoothing the doubts of most of her opponents, and more
importantly, had maintained the alliance that had ended the ceaseless wars with Cairhien. In such
ways did queens choose their husbands. Taringail had been a cold, distant man, and there was never
love, despite two wonderful children; it had been almost a relief when he died in a hunting accident.
Thomdril Merrilin, House bard and then Court-bard, had been a joy at first, intelligent and witty,
a laughing man who used the tricks of the Game of Houses to aid her to the throne and help strengthen
Andor once she had it. He had been twice her age then, yet she might have married him—marriages
with commoners were not unheard of in Andor—but he vanished without a word, and her temper got
the better of her. She never had learned why he had gone, but it did not matter. When he finally
returned she would surely have rescinded the arrest order, but for once instead of softly turning her
anger aside he had met her harsh word for harsh word, saying things she could never forgive. Her
ears still burned to remember being called a spoiled child and a puppet of Tar Valon. He had actually
shaken her, his queen!
Then there had been Gareth Bryne, strong and capable, as bluff as his face and as stubborn as
she; he had turned out to be a treasonous fool. He was well out of her life. It seemed years since she
had seen him instead of little more than half of one.
And finally Gaebril. The crown to her list of bad choices. At least the others had not tried to
supplant her.
Not so many men for one woman’s life, but in another way, too many. Another thing that Lini
sometimes said was that men were only good for three things, though very good for those. She had
been on the throne before Lini had thought her old enough to tell what the three things were. Perhaps
if I’d kept just to the dancing, she thought wryly, I’d not have so much trouble with them.
The shadows in the garden beyond the window had shifted an hour’s worth before Lini returned
with young Tallanvor, who went to one knee while she was still shutting the door. “He didn’t want to
come with me at first,” she said. “Fifty years ago I suppose I could have shown what you are
displaying to the world, and he’d have followed quick enough, but now I must needs use sweet
reason.”
Tallanvor turned his head to look up at her sourly. “You threatened to harry me here with a stick
if I did not come. You are lucky I wondered what was so important to you, instead of having
somebody drag you to the infirmary.” Her stern sniff did not faze him. His acrid gaze turned angry as
it shifted to Morgase. “I see your meeting with Gaebril did not go well, my Queen. I had hoped for
. . . more.”
He was looking straight at her eyes, but Lini’s comment had made her aware of her dress again.
She felt as though glowing arrows were pointing to her exposed bosom. It was an effort to keep her
hands calmly in her lap. “You are a sharp lad, Tallanvor. And loyal, I believe, else you would not
have come to me with the news of the Two Rivers.”
“I am not a boy,” he snapped, jerking upright where he knelt. “I am a man who has sworn his life
in service to his queen.”
She let her temper flare right back at him. “If you are a man, behave as one. Stand, and answer
your queen’s questions truthfully. And remember that I am your queen, young Tallanvor. Whatever
you think may have happened, I am Queen of Andor.”
“Forgive me, my Queen. I hear and obey.” The words were properly said, if not exactly contrite,
but he stood, head high, staring at her as defiantly as ever. Light, the man was as stubborn as Gareth

Bryne had ever been.
“How many loyal men are there among the Guards in the Palace? How many will obey their
oaths and follow me?”
“I will,” he said quietly, and suddenly all of his anger was gone, though he still stared intently at
her face. “For the rest . . . If you wish to find loyal men, you must look to the outlying garrisons,
perhaps as far as Whitebridge. Some who were in Caemlyn were sent to Cairhien with the levies, but
the rest in the city are Gaebril’s to a man. Their new . . . Their new oath is to throne and law, not the
Queen.”
It was worse than she had hoped for, but no more than she had expected, really. Whatever he
was, Gaebril was no fool. “Then I must go elsewhere to begin reestablishing my rule.” The Houses
would be difficult to rally after the exiles, after Ellorien, but it had to be done. “Gaebril may try to
stop me leaving the Palace”—she found a faint memory of trying to leave, twice, and being halted by
Gaebril—“so you will procure two horses and wait in the street behind the south stables. I will meet
you there, dressed for riding.”
“Too public,” he said. “And too close. Gaebril’s men might recognize you, however you
disguised yourself. I know a man. . . . Could you find an inn called The Queen’s Blessing, in the
western part of the New City?” The New City was new only in comparison with the Inner City it
surrounded.
“I can.” She did not like being opposed, even when it made sense. Bryne had done that, too. It
would be a pleasure to show this young man just how well she could disguise herself. It was her habit
once a year, though she realized that she had not done it so far this year, to dress as a commoner and
walk the streets to feel the pulse of the people. No one had ever recognized her. “But can this man be
trusted, young Tallanvor?”
“Basel Gill is as loyal to you as I am myself.” He hesitated, anguish crossing his face then being
replaced by anger once more. “Why have you waited so long? You must have known, you must have
seen, yet you have waited while Gaebril tightened his hands around Andor’s neck. Why have you
waited?”
So. His anger was honestly come by, and it deserved an honest answer. Only she had no answer,
certainly not one she could tell him. “It is not your place to question your Queen, young man,” she
said with a gentle firmness. “A loyal man, as I know that you are loyal, serves without question.”
He let out a long breath. “I will await you in the stable of The Queen’s Blessing, my Queen.”
And with a bow suitable for a state audience, he was gone.
“Why do you keep calling him young?” Lini demanded once the door closed. “It puts his back
up. ‘A fool puts a burr under the saddle before she rides.’ ”
“He is young, Lini. Young enough to be my son.”
Lini snorted, and this time there was nothing delicate about it. “He has a few years on Galad,
and Galad is too old to be yours. You were playing with dolls when Tallanvor was born, and thinking
babes came the same way as dolls.”
Sighing, Morgase wondered if the woman had treated her mother like this. Probably. And if Lini
lived long enough to see Elayne on the throne—which somehow she did not doubt, Lini would last
forever—she would probably treat Elayne no differently. That was assuming that a throne remained
for Elayne to inherit. “The question is, is he as loyal as he seems, Lini? One faithful Guardsman,
when every other loyal man in the Palace has been sent away. Suddenly it seems too good to be true.”
“He swore the new oath.” Morgase opened her mouth, but Lini forestalled her. “I saw him
afterwards, alone behind the stables. That’s how I knew who you meant; I found out his name. He did

not see me. He was on his knees, tears streaming down his face. He alternated apologizing to you and
repeating the old oath. Not just to ‘the Queen of Andor,’ but to ‘Queen Morgase of Andor.’ He swore
in the old way, on his sword, slicing his arm to show he would shed his last drop before breaking it. I
know a thing or two of men, girl. That one will follow you against an army with nothing but his bare
hands.”
That was good to know. If she could not trust him, she would have to doubt Lini next. No, never
Lini. He had sworn in the old way? That was something for stories, now. And she was letting her
thoughts drift again. Surely Gaebril’s clouding of her mind was finished now, with all she knew. Then
why did a part of her still want to go back to her sitting room and wait? She had to concentrate. “I
will need a simple dress, Lini. One that does not fit too well. A little soot from the fireplace, and . . .”
Lini insisted on coming, too. Morgase would have had to tie her to a chair to leave her behind,
and she was not certain that the old woman would have let herself be tied; she had always seemed
frail, and had always been far stronger than she seemed.
When they slipped out through a small side gate, Morgase did not look very much like herself. A
bit of soot had darkened her red-gold hair, taken its sheen away and made it lank. Sweat rolling down
her face helped, as well. No one believed that queens sweated. A shapeless dress of rough—very
rough—gray wool, with divided skirts, completed her disguise. Even her shift and stockings were
coarse wool. She looked a farm woman who had ridden the cart horse to market and now wanted to
see a little of the city. Lini looked herself, straight-backed and no-nonsense, in a green woolen riding
dress, well cut but ten years out of fashion.
Wishing she could scratch, Morgase also wished that the other woman had not taken her so to
heart about the dress not fitting very well. Stuffing the low-necked gown away under the bed, her old
nurse had muttered some saying about displaying wares you did not mean to sell, and when Morgase
claimed she had just made it up, her reply was At my age, if I make it up, it’s still an old saying.
Morgase more than half-suspected that her itchy, ill-draped dress was punishment for that gown.
The Inner City was built on hills, streets following the natural curve of the land and planned to
give sudden views of parks full of trees and monuments, or tile-covered towers glittering a hundred
colors in the sun. Sudden rises hurled the eye across Caemlyn entire, to the rolling plains and forests
beyond. Morgase saw none of it as she hurried through the crowds thronging the streets. Usually she
would have tried to listen to the people, to gauge their mood. This time she heard only the hum and
babble of a great city. She had no thought of trying to rouse them. Thousands of men armed mainly
with stones and rage could overwhelm the Guards in the Royal Palace, but if she had not known it
before, the riots in the spring that had brought Gaebril to her attention, and the near riots the year
before, had shown what mobs could do. She meant to rule again in Caemlyn, not see it burned.
Beyond the white walls of the Inner City, the New City had its own beauties. Tall slender
towers, and domes gleaming white and gold, huge expanses of red-tiled roofs, and the great, towered
outer walls, pale gray streaked with silver and white. Broad boulevards, split down the middle by
wide expanses of trees and grass, were jammed with people and carriages and wagons. Except to
notice in passing that the grass was dying for lack of rain, Morgase kept her mind on what she was
hunting.
From the experience of her annual forays, she chose the people she questioned carefully. Men,
mostly. She knew how she looked, even with soot in her hair, and some women would give wrong
directions from jealousy. Men, on the other hand, racked their brains to be right, to impress her. None
with too smug a face, or too rough. The first were often offended at being approached, as though they
were not afoot themselves, and the others were likely to think a woman asking directions had

something else on her mind.
One fellow with a chin too big for his face, hawking a tray of pins and needles, grinned at her
and said, “Did anyone ever tell you you look a mite like the Queen? Whatever mess she’s made of us,
she’s a pretty one.”
She gave him a raucous laugh that earned a stern look from Lini. “You save your flattery for your
wife. The second turn to the left, you say? I thank you. And for the compliment, too.”
As she pushed on through the crowd, a frown settled on her face. She had heard too much of that.
Not that she looked like the Queen, but that Morgase had made a mess of things. Gaebril had raised
taxes heavily to pay for his levies, it seemed, but she took the blame, and rightly so. The
responsibility was the Queen’s. Other laws had come out of the Palace, as well, laws that made little
sense, but did make people’s lives more difficult. She heard whispers about herself, that maybe
Andor had had queens long enough. Only murmurs, but what one man dared speak in a low voice, ten
thought. Perhaps it would not have been as easy as she had thought to rouse mobs against Gaebril.
Eventually she found her goal, a broad stone inn, the sign over the door bearing a man kneeling
before a golden-haired woman in the Rose Crown, one of her hands on his head. The Queen’s
Blessing. If it was meant to be her, it was not a good likeness. The cheeks were too fat.
Not until she stopped in front of the inn did she realize that Lini was puffing. She had set a quick
pace, and the woman was far from young. “Lini, I am sorry. I should not have walked so—”
“If I can’t keep up with you, girl, how will I be able to tend Elayne’s babes? Do you mean to
stand there? ‘Dragging feet never finish a journey.’ He said he would be in the stable.”
The white-haired woman stalked off, muttering to herself, and Morgase followed her around the
inn. Before stepping into the stone stable, she shaded her eyes to look at the sun. No more than two
hours until dusk; Gaebril would be looking by then, if he was not already.
Tallanvor was not alone in the stall-lined stable. When he went to one knee on the strawcovered floor, in a green wool coat with his sword belted over it, two men and a woman knelt with
him, if a bit hesitantly, unsure of her as she was. The stout man, pink-faced and balding, must be Basel
Gill, the innkeeper. An old leather jerkin, studded with steel discs, strained around his girth, and he
wore a sword at his hip, too.
“My Queen,” Gill said, “I’ve not carried a sword in years—not since the Aiel War—but I’d
count it an honor if you allowed me to follow you.” He should have looked ridiculous, but he did not.
Morgase studied the other two, a hulking fellow in a rough gray coat, with heavy-lidded eyes, an
oft-broken nose, and scars on his face, and a short, pretty woman approaching her middle years. She
seemed to be with the street tough, but her high-necked blue wool dress appeared too finely woven
for one like him to have bought.
The fellow sensed her doubts, for all his lazy-eyed appearance. “I am Lamgwin, my Queen, and
a good Queen’s man. ’Tisn’t right, what’s been done, and it has to be put straight. I want to follow
you, too. Me and Breane, both.”
“Rise,” she told them. “It may be some days yet before it is safe for you to acknowledge me as
your queen. I will be glad of your company, Master Gill. And yours, Master Lamgwin, but it will be
safer for your woman if she remains in Caemlyn. There are hard days ahead.”
Brushing straw from her skirts, Breane gave her a sharp look, and Lini a sharper. “I have known
hard days,” she said in a Cairhienin accent. Nobly born, unless Morgase missed her guess; one of the
refugees. “And I never knew a good man until I found Lamgwin. Or until he found me. The loyalty and
love he bears for you, I bear for him tenfold. He follows you, but I follow him. I will not stay
behind.”

Morgase drew breath, then nodded her acceptance. The woman seemed to take it for granted in
any case. A fine seed for the army to retake her throne: One young soldier who scowled at her as
often as not, a balding innkeeper who looked as if he had not been on a horse in twenty years, a street
tough who appeared more than half-asleep, and a refugee Cairhienin noblewoman who had made it
clear that her loyalties went only as far as the tough. And Lini, of course. Lini, who treated her as
though she were still in the nursery. Oh, yes, a very fine seed.
“Where do we go, my Queen?” Gill asked as he began leading already saddled horses out of
their stalls. Lamgwin moved with surprising speed to throw another high-cantled saddle on a horse
for Lini.
Morgase realized that she had not considered that. Light, Gaebril can’t still be fogging my
mind. She still felt that urge to return to her sitting room, though. It was not he. She had had to
concentrate on getting out of the Palace and reaching here. Once she would have gone to Ellorien
first, but Pelivar or Arathelle would do. Once she had reasoned out how to explain away their exiles.
Before she could open her mouth, Tallanvor said, “It must be to Gareth Bryne. There is hard
feeling against you among the great Houses, my Queen, but with Bryne following you, they will
reswear allegiance, if only because they know he will win every battle.”
She clamped her teeth shut to hold back instant refusal. Bryne was a traitor. But he was also one
of the finest generals alive. His presence would be a convincing argument when she had to make
Pelivar and the rest forget that she had exiled them. Very well. No doubt he would leap at the chance
to be Captain-General of the Queen’s Guards once more. And if not, she would manage well enough
without him.
When the sun touched the horizon, they were five miles out of Caemlyn and riding hard for Kore
Springs.
Night was when Padan Fain felt most comfortable. As he padded through the tapestry-bedecked
corridors of the White Tower, it seemed as though the darkness outside made a cloak to hide him
from his enemies, despite the stand-lamps, gilded and mirrored, burning along his way. A false
feeling, he knew; his enemies were many and everywhere. Right that moment, as in every waking
hour, he could feel Rand al’Thor. Not where he was, but that he was still alive, somewhere. Still
alive. It was a gift received at Shayol Ghul, in the Pit of Doom, that awareness of al’Thor.
His mind skittered away from memories of what had been done to him in the Pit. He had been
distilled there, remade. But later, in Aridhol, he had been reborn. Reborn to smite old enemies and
new.
He could feel something else as he stalked the empty night hallways of the Tower, a thing that
was his, stolen from him. A sharper desire drew him at this moment than his longing for al’Thor’s
death, or the Tower’s destruction, or even revenge against his ancient foe. A hunger to be whole.
The heavy paneled door had thick hinges and iron straps, and a black iron lock set in it as big as
his head. Few doors in the Tower were ever locked—who would dare steal in the midst of Aes
Sedai?—yet some things the Tower accounted too dangerous to be easily accessible. The most
dangerous of all they kept behind this door, guarded by a stout lock.
Giggling softly, he took two thin, curved metal rods from his coat pocket, inserted them into the
keyhole, probing and pressing, twisting. With a slow snap, the bolt came back. For a moment he
sagged against the door, laughing hoarsely. Guarded by a stout lock. Surrounded by Aes Sedai power,
and guarded by simple metal. Even the servants and novices should be done with their chores at this
hour, but someone still might be awake, might just wander by. Occasional ripples of mirth still shook

him as he replaced the lockpicks in his pocket and took out a fat beeswax candle, lighting the wick at
a nearby stand-lamp.
He held the candle high as he closed the door behind him, peering around. Shelves lined the
walls, holding plain boxes and inlaid chests of various sizes and shapes, small figures in bone or
ivory or darker material, things of metal and glass and crystal that sparkled in the candlelight. Nothing
that appeared dangerous. Dust covered everything; even the Aes Sedai came here seldom, and they
allowed no one else in. What he was seeking pulled him to it.
On a waist-high shelf stood a dark metal box. He opened it, revealing lead walls two inches
thick, with just enough space inside for a curved dagger in a golden sheath, a large ruby set in its hilt.
Neither the gold nor the ruby, glittering dark as blood, interested him. Hastily he spilled a little wax
to hold the candle beside the box and snatched up the dagger.
He sighed as soon as he touched it, stretched languorously. He was whole again, one with what
had bound him so long ago, one with what in a very real way had given him life.
Iron hinges creaked faintly, and he darted for the door, baring the curved blade. The pale young
woman opening the door had only time to gape, to try to leap back, before he slashed her cheek; in the
same motion he dropped the sheath and seized her arm, jerked her past him into the storeroom. Putting
his head out, he peered up and down the hallway. Still empty.
He took his time about pulling his head back and shutting the door again. He knew what he
would find.
The young woman lay thrashing on the stone floor, trying and failing to scream. Her hands
clawed at a face already black and bloated beyond recognition, the dark swelling oozing down onto
her shoulders like thick oil. Her snowy skirts, banded in colors at the hem, flailed as her feet
scrabbled uselessly. He licked at a splash of blood on his hand and giggled as he picked up the
sheath.
“You are a fool.”
He spun, dagger reaching, but the air around him seemed to turn solid, encasing him from his
neck to the soles of his boots. He hung there, on the balls of his feet, dagger extended to stab, staring
at Alviarin as she shut the door behind her and leaned against it to study him. There had been no creak
this time. The soft scraping of the dying girl’s slippers on the floorstones could never have masked it.
He blinked away sweat that was suddenly stinging his eyes.
“Did you really think,” the Aes Sedai went on, “that there would be no guard on this room, no
watch kept? A ward was set on that lock. That young fool’s task tonight was to monitor it. Had she
done as she was supposed to, you would find a dozen Warders and as many Aes Sedai outside this
door now. She is paying the price of her stupidity.”
The thrashing behind him stilled, and his eyes narrowed. Alviarin was not Yellow Ajah, but
even so she could have made an attempt to Heal the young woman. And she had not raised the alarm
the Accepted should have, either, or she would not now be here alone. “You are Black Ajah,” he
whispered.
“A dangerous accusation,” she said calmly. It was not clear to which of them it was dangerous.
“Siuan Sanche tried to claim the Black Ajah was real when she was under the question. She begged to
tell us of them. Elaida would not hear it, and will not. Tales of the Black Ajah are a vile slander
against the Tower.”
“You are Black Ajah,” he said in a louder voice.
“You want to steal that?” She sounded as though he had not spoken. “The ruby is not worth it,
Fain. Or whatever your name is. That blade is tainted so none but a fool would touch it except with

tongs, or be near it for a moment longer than necessary. You can see what it did to Verine. So why did
you come here and go straight to what you should not have known was here? You cannot have had
time for any search.”
“I could dispose of Elaida for you. One touch of this, and even Healing will not save her.” He
tried to gesture with the dagger, but could not budge it a hair; if he could have moved it, Alviarin
would be dead by now. “You could be first in the Tower, not second.”
She laughed at him, cool contemptuous chimes. “Do you think I would not be first if I had wished
it? Second suits me. Let Elaida claim credit for what she calls successes, and sweat for her failures,
too. I know where the power lies. Now, answer my questions, or two corpses will be found here in
the morning instead of one.”
There would be two in any case, whether he answered her with suitable lies or not; she did not
mean to let him live. “I have seen Thakan’dar.” Saying that hurt; the memories it brought were agony.
He refused to whimper, forced the words out. “The great sea of fog, rolling and crashing in silence
against the black cliffs, the fires of the forges glowing red beneath, and lightning stabbing up into a
sky fit to drive men mad.” He did not want to go on, but he made himself. “I have taken the path down
to the belly of Shayol Ghul, down the long way with stones like fangs brushing my head, to the shore
of a lake of fire and molten rock—” No, not again! “—that holds the Great Lord of the Dark in its
endless depths. The heavens above Shayol Ghul are black at noon with his breath.”
Alviarin was standing upright now, eyes wide. Not fearful, but impressed. “I have heard of . . .”
she began softly, then shook herself and stared at him piercingly. “Who are you? Why are you here?
Did one of the For—the Chosen send you? Why was I not informed?”
He threw back his head and laughed. “Are the tasks given to the likes of me for the likes of you
to be knowing?” The accents of his native Lugard were strong again; in a way it was his native city.
“Do the Chosen confide everything in you, then?” Something inside seemed to shout that this was not
the way, but he hated Aes Sedai, and that something inside him did, too. “Be careful, pretty little Aes
Sedai, or they’ll be giving you to a Myrddraal for its sport.”
Her glare was icicles stabbing his eyes. “We shall see, Master Fain. I will clear away this mess
you have made, and then we shall see which of us stands higher with the Chosen.” Eyeing the dagger,
she backed from the room. The air around him did not soften until she had been gone a full minute.
Silently he snarled at himself. Fool. Playing the Aes Sedai’s game, groveling for them, then one
moment of anger to ruin all. Sheathing the dagger, he nicked himself, and licked the wound before
sticking the weapon under his coat. He was not at all what she thought. He had been a Darkfriend
once, but he was beyond that, now. Beyond it, above it. Something different. Something more. If she
managed to communicate with one of the Forsaken before he could dispose of her . . . Better not to
try. No time to find the Horn of Valere now. There were followers awaiting him outside the city.
They should still be waiting. He had put fear into them. He hoped some of the humans were still alive.
Before the sun rose he was out of the Tower, off the island of Tar Valon. Al’Thor was out there,
somewhere. And he was whole again.

CHAPTER
20

Jangai Pass

Under the looming Spine of the World, Rand guided Jeade’en up the stony slope from the
foothills that began the foot of Jangai Pass. The Dragonwall pierced the sky, dwarfing all other
mountains, its snowcapped peaks defying the baking afternoon sun. The tallest thrust well above
clouds that mocked the Waste with promises of rain that had never come. Rand could not imagine why
a man would want to climb a mountain, but it was said that men who had tried to scale these heights
turned back, overcome with fear and unable to breathe. He could well believe that a man might grow
too afraid to breathe, attempting to climb so high.
“. . . yet though the Cairhienin are consumed with the Game of Houses,” Moiraine was saying at
his shoulder, “they will follow you so long as they know that you are strong. Be firm with them, but I
would ask you to be fair also. A ruler who gives true justice . . .”
He tried to ignore her, as he did the other riders, and the creak and rumble of Kadere’s wagons,
making heavy going further back. The broken gorges and gullies of the Waste were behind them, but
these rugged rising hills, nearly as barren, were little better for wagons. No one had traveled this path
in over twenty years.
Moiraine talked at him that way from daybreak to sunset whenever he let her. Her lectures could
be on small things—details of court behavior, say, in Cairhien or Saldaea or somewhere else—or on
large: the political influence of the Whitecloaks, or perhaps the effects of trade on rulers’ decisions to
go to war. It was as if she meant to see him educated, as a noble would be, or should be, before he
reached the other side of the mountains. It was surprising how often what she said reflected what
anyone back in Emond’s Field would have called simple common sense. And also how often it did
not.
Occasionally she came out with something startling; for instance, that he should trust no woman
of the Tower except herself, Egwene, Elayne and Nynaeve, or the news that Elaida was now the
Amyrlin Seat. Oath to obey or no, she would not tell him how she knew that. She said it was someone
else’s place to tell if she chose, someone else’s secret, and she could not usurp it. He suspected the
Wise One dreamwalkers, though they had stared him right in the eye and refused to say aye or nay. He
wished he could make them swear Moiraine’s oath; they interfered between him and the chiefs
continually, as if they wanted him to go through them to reach the chiefs.
Right that minute he did not want to think about Elaida or the Wise Ones, or listen to Moiraine.
Now he wanted to study the pass ahead, a deep gap in the mountains that twisted as though a blunt axe
had tried to chop through again and again, never quite succeeding. A few minutes’ hard ride, and he
could be in it.
On one side of the pass mouth a sheer cliff had been smoothed over a hundred-pace width and

carved, a wind-weathered snake entwining a staff a good three hundred spans high; monument or
marker or ruler’s sigil, it surely dated from some lost nation before Artur Hawkwing, perhaps even
before the Trolloc Wars. He had seen remnants before from nations long vanished; often even
Moiraine did not know their source.
High on the other side, so far up that he was not sure he was seeing what he thought, just below
the snow line, stood something even stranger. Something that made the first monument of a few
thousand years a commonplace. He could have sworn it was the remnants of shattered buildings,
shining gray against the darker mountain, and stranger still, what appeared to be a dock of the same
material, as for ships, slanting drunkenly down the mountain. If he was not imagining it, that had to
date from before the Breaking. The face of the world had been changed utterly in those years. This
could well have been an ocean’s floor, before. He would have to ask Asmodean. Even if he had had
the time, he did not think he would want to try reaching that altitude to find out for himself.
At the foot of the huge snake lay Taien, a high-walled town of moderate size, a remnant itself of
the time when Cairhien had been allowed to send caravans across the Three-fold Land, and wealth
had flowed from Shara along the Silk Path. There appeared to be birds above the town, and dark
blotches at regular intervals along the gray stone walls. Mat stood in Pips’ stirrups, shading his eyes
with that broad-brimmed hat to peer up the pass, frowning. Lan’s hard face wore no expression at all,
yet he appeared just as intent; a gust of wind, a little cooler here, whipped his color-shifting cloak
around him, and for a moment all of him from shoulders to boots seemed to blend into the rocky hills
and sparse thornbushes.
“Are you listening to me?” Moiraine said suddenly, reining her white mare closer. “You must
—!” She took a deep breath. “Please, Rand. There is so much that I must tell you, so much that you
need to know.”
The hint of pleading in her tone made him glance at her. He could remember when he had been
overawed by her presence. Now she seemed quite small, for all her regal manner. A fool thing, that
he should feel protective of her. “There is plenty of time ahead of us, Moiraine,” he said gently. “I
don’t pretend to think I know as much of the world as you. I mean to keep you close from now on.” He
barely realized how great a change that was from when she was keeping him close. “But I have
something else on my mind right now.”
“Of course.” She sighed. “As you wish. We have plenty of time yet.”
Rand heeled the dappled gray stallion to a trot, and the others followed. The wagons quickened,
too, though they could not keep up on the slope. Asmodean’s—Jasin Natael’s—patch-covered
gleeman’s cloak rippled behind him like the banner he carried at his stirrup, brilliant red with the
white-and-black symbol of the ancient Aes Sedai at its center. His face wore a sullen glower; he had
not been best pleased at having to be the bannerman. Under that sign he would conquer, the Prophecy
of Rhuidean said, and perhaps it would not frighten the world so much as the Dragon Banner, Lews
Therin’s banner, that he had left flying over the Stone of Tear. Few would know this sign.
The blotches on the walls of Taien were bodies, contorted in their final agonies, bloated in the
sun and hanging by their necks in a row that seemed to encircle the town. The birds were glossy black
ravens, and vultures with their heads and necks befouled. Some ravens perched on corpses, gorging,
unconcerned for the new arrivals. The sickly sweet stench of corruption hung in the dry air, and the
acrid smell of char. Iron-strapped gates stood gaping open on an expanse of ruin, soot-streaked stone
houses and collapsed roofs. Nothing moved except the birds.
Like Mar Ruois. He tried to shake the thought away, but in his head he could see that great city
after it was retaken, immense towers blackened and collapsing, the remains of great bonfires at every

street crossing, where those who had refused to swear to the Shadow had been bound and thrown
alive to the flames. He knew whose memory it had to be, though he had not discussed it with
Moiraine. I am Rand al’Thor. Lews Therin Telamon is dead three thousand years. I am myself!
That was one battle he meant to win. If he did have to die at Shayol Ghul, he would die as himself. He
made himself think of something else.
Half a month since he had left Rhuidean. Half a month, though the Aiel had set a pace afoot from
sunup to sundown that wearied the horses. But Couladin had been moving this way a week before he
learned of it. If they had not managed to close any ground, he would have that long to ravage Cairhien
before Rand could reach it. Longer, before the Shaido could be brought to bay. Not a much happier
thought.
“There’s someone watching us from those rocks to the left,” Lan said quietly. He seemed to be
completely engrossed in studying what remained of Taien. “Not Aiel, or I doubt I would have seen a
glimmer.”
Rand was glad that he had made Egwene and Aviendha stay with the Wise Ones. The town gave
him a new reason, but the watcher fit in with his original plan, when he had hoped that Taien had
escaped. Egwene still wore the same Aiel clothes as Aviendha, and Aiel would not have been very
welcome in Taien. They were even less likely to be welcome among the survivors.
He looked back at the wagons drawing to a halt a short distance downslope. Mutters drifted up
from the drivers now that they could see the town clearly, and the wall’s decorations. Kadere, his
bulk all in white again today, mopped at his hawk-nosed face with a large kerchief; he appeared
unperturbed, merely pursing his lips thoughtfully.
Rand expected that Moiraine would have to find new drivers once they were through the pass.
Kadere and his crew would likely flee as soon as they had the chance. And he would have to let them
go. It was not right—it was not justice—but it was necessary to protect Asmodean. How long now
had he been doing what was necessary instead of what was right? In a fair world, they would be one
and the same. That made him laugh, a hoarse wheeze. He was far from the village boy he had been,
but sometimes that boy sneaked up on him. The others looked at him, and he fought the urge to tell
them that he was not mad yet.
Long minutes passed before two coatless men and a woman emerged from the rocks, all three
ragged and dirty and barefoot. They approached hesitantly, heads tilted uneasily, eyes darting from
rider to rider, to the wagons and back, as though they might take flight at a shout. Gaunt cheeks and
wavering steps spoke of hunger.
“Thank the Light,” one of the men said finally. He was gray-haired—none of the three was young
—his face deeply creased. His eyes lingered a moment on Asmodean, with falls of lace at collar and
cuffs, but the leader of this train would not be riding a mule and carrying a banner. It was Rand’s
stirrup that he clutched anxiously. “The Light be praised that you came out of those terrible lands
alive, my Lord.” That might have been Rand’s blue silk coat, embroidered in gold on the shoulders,
or the banner, or simple flattery. The man certainly had no reason to think them other than merchants,
if well dressed for it. “Those murdering savages have risen again. It is another Aiel War. They were
over the wall in the night before anybody knew, killing everyone who raised a hand, stealing
everything not mortared in place.”
“In the night?” Mat said sharply. Hat pulled low, he was still studying the ruined town. “Were
your sentries asleep? You did have sentries this close to your enemies? Even Aiel would have a hard
time coming at you if you kept a good watch.” Lan gave him an appraising look.
“No, my Lord.” The gray-haired man blinked at Mat, then gave his answer to Rand. Mat’s green

coat was fine enough for a lord, but it hung open and looked slept in. “We . . . We had only a
watchman at each gate. It has been long since any have even seen one of the savages. But this time . . .
Whatever they did not steal, they burned, and drove us out to starve. Filthy animals! Thank the Light
you have come to save us, my Lord, or we would all have died here. I am Tal Nethin. I am—I was—a
saddlemaker. A good one, my Lord. This is my sister Aril, and her husband, Ander Corl. He makes
fine boots.”
“They stole people, too, my Lord,” the woman said, her voice raw. Somewhat younger than her
brother, she might have been handsome once, but haggard worry had etched lines in her face that Rand
suspected would never entirely go away. Her husband had a lost look in his eyes, as if not exactly
sure where he was. “My daughter, my Lord, and my son. They took all the young ones, everyone
above sixteen, and some twice that or more. Said they were guy-something, and stripped them naked
right in the street and herded them off. My Lord, can you . . . ?” She trailed off, eyes squeezing shut as
the impossibility overwhelmed her, swaying. Small odds that she would ever see her children again.
Moiraine was out of her saddle in an instant and by Aril’s side. The haggard woman gave a loud
gasp as soon as the Aes Sedai’s hands touched her, shivering to her toetips. Her wondering look
turned to Moiraine questioningly, but Moiraine only held her as if supporting her.
The woman’s husband suddenly gaped, staring at Rand’s gilded belt buckle, the gift from
Aviendha. “His arms were marked like that. Like that. All twined around, like the cliff snake.”
Tal looked up at Rand uncertainly. “The savages’ leader, my Lord. He—had markings like that
on his arms. He wore those strange clothes they all do, but he had his coatsleeves cut off, and he made
sure everybody saw.”
“A gift I received in the Waste,” Rand said. He made sure to keep his hands still on his pommel;
his coatsleeves hid his own Dragons, except for the heads; they would be visible on the backs of his
hands to anyone who looked closely. Aril had forgotten about wondering what Moiraine had actually
done, and all three looked on the point of running. “How long since they left?”
“Six days, my Lord,” Tal said uneasily. “They did what they did in a night and a day and were
gone the next. We would have gone, too, but what if we met them coming back? Surely they were
turned back at Selean?” That was the town at the other end of the pass. Rand doubted that Selean was
in any better condition than Taien by this time.
“How many survivors are there besides you three?”
“Maybe a hundred, my Lord. Maybe more. Nobody has counted.”
Abruptly anger flared in him, though he tried to hold it down. “A hundred of you?” His voice
was icy iron. “And six days? Then why are your dead left for the ravens? Why do corpses still
decorate your town walls? Those are your people filling your nostrils with their stink!” Huddling
together, the three backed away from his horse.
“We were afraid, my Lord,” Tal said hoarsely. “They went, but they could come back. And he
told us . . . The one with the markings on his arms told us not to touch anything.”
“A message,” Ander said in a dull voice. “He chose them out to hang, just pulling them out until
he had enough to line the wall. Men, women, he did not care.” His eyes were fixed on Rand’s buckle.
“He said they were a message for some man who would be following him. He said he wanted this
man to know . . . know what they were going to do on the other side of the Spine. He said . . . He said
he would do worse to this man.”
Aril’s eyes widened suddenly, and the three stared beyond Rand for a moment, gaping. Then,
screaming, they turned and ran. Black-veiled Aiel rose from the rocks they had come from, and they
darted off in another direction. Veiled Aiel appeared there, too, and they collapsed to the ground,

sobbing and holding each other as they were surrounded. Moiraine’s face was cool and composed,
but her eyes were not serene.
Rand twisted in his saddle. Rhuarc and Dhearic were coming up the slope, unveiling themselves
and unwrapping the shoufa from around their heads. Dhearic was thicker than Rhuarc, with a
prominent nose and paler streaks through his golden hair. He had brought the Reyn Aiel as Rhuarc had
said he would.
Timolan and his Miagoma had been paralleling them to the north for three days, exchanging
occasional messengers but giving no clue to his intentions. The Codarra and the Shiande and the
Daryne were still somewhere to the east; following, so Amys and the others said from dreamtalking to
their Wise Ones, but slowly. Those Wise Ones had no more idea of their clan chiefs’ aims than Rand
did of Timolan’s.
“Was that necessary?” he said as the two chiefs came up to him. He had frightened the people
first, but for cause, and had not made them think that they were going to die.
Rhuarc simply shrugged, and Dhearic said, “We put spears in place around this hold unseen, as
you wished, and there seemed no reason to wait since no one remained here to dance spears. Besides,
they are only treekillers.”
Rand drew a deep breath. He had known this might be as large a problem as Couladin, in its
own way. Nearly five hundred years ago the Aiel had presented Cairhien with a sapling, a cutting
from Avendesora, and with it a right granted to no other nation, to trade across the Three-fold Land to
Shara. They had given no reason—they did not like wetlanders very much at the best—but to the Aiel
it had been required by ji’e’toh. During the long years of journey that had brought them to the Waste,
only one people had not attacked them, only one had allowed them water uncontested when the world
grew parched. And finally they had found the descendants of those people. The Cairhienin.
For five hundred years riches had flowed into Cairhien with the silk and the ivory. Five hundred
years, and Avendoraldera grew in Cairhein. And then King Laman had had the tree cut down to make
a throne. The nations knew why the Aiel had crossed the Spine of the World twenty years ago—
Laman’s Sin, they called it, and Laman’s Pride—but few knew that to the Aiel it had not been a war.
Four clans had come to find an oathbreaker, and when they had killed him, they returned to the Threefold Land. But their contempt for the treekillers, the oathbreakers, had never died. Moiraine being
Aes Sedai offset her being Cairhienin, but Rand was never sure how much.
“These folk broke no oaths,” he told them. “Find the others; the saddlemaker says there are about
a hundred. And be gentle with them. If any of them were watching, they’re probably running away into
the mountains by now.” The two Aiel started to turn away, and he added, “Did you hear what they
told me? What do you think of what Couladin did here?”
“They killed more than they had to,” Dhearic said with a disgusted shake of his head. “Like
black ferrets falling on rockhens’ nests in a gully.” Killing was as easy as dying, so the Aiel said; any
fool could do either.
“And the other thing? Taking prisoners. Gai’shain.”
Rhuarc and Dhearic exchanged looks, and Dhearic’s mouth tightened. Clearly they had heard,
and it made them uncomfortable. It took a great deal to make an Aiel uncomfortable.
“It cannot be so,” Rhuarc said at last. “If it is . . . Gai’shain is a thing of ji’e’toh. No one can be
made gai’shain who does not follow ji’e’toh, else they are only human animals, such as the Sharans
keep.”
“Couladin has abandoned ji’e’toh.” Dhearic sounded as though he were saying stones had grown
wings.

Mat guided Pips closer, using his knees. He had never been more than an indifferent rider, but
sometimes, when he was thinking of something else, he rode as though born on a horse’s back. “That
surprises you?” he said. “After everything he has done already? The man would cheat at dice with his
mother.”
They gave him flat-eyed stares, like blue stones. In many ways, Aiel were ji’e’toh. And
whatever else Couladin was, he was still Aiel in their eyes. Sept before clan, clan before outsiders,
but Aiel before wetlanders.
Some of the Maidens joined them, Enaila and Jolien and Adelin, and wiry, white-haired Sulin,
who had been chosen roofmistress of the Roof of the Maidens in Rhuidean. She had told the Maidens
who stayed to choose another, and now she led the Maidens here. They sensed the mood, and said
nothing, only grounded their spearpoints patiently. An Aiel who wanted to could make the rocks look
hasty.
Lan broke the silence. “If Couladin expects you to be following him, he may have left a surprise
somewhere in the pass. A hundred men could hold some of those narrows against an army. A
thousand . . .”
“We will camp here, then,” Rand said, “and send scouts ahead to make sure the way is clear.
Duadhe Mahdi’in?”
“Water Seekers,” Dhearic agreed, sounding pleased. That had been his society before he became
clan chief.
Sulin and the other Maidens gave Rand flat stares as the Reyn chief walked away downslope.
He had chosen scouts from other societies for the last three days, when he had begun to fear what he
might find here, and he had the feeling they knew he was not just giving the others their turns. He tried
to ignore their looks. Sulin’s was especially difficult; the woman could have driven nails with those
pale blue eyes.
“Rhuarc, once the survivors are found, see that they’re fed. And well treated. We will take them
with us.” His gaze was drawn to the town wall. Some Aiel were already using their curved horn
bows to kill ravens. Sometimes Shadowspawn used ravens and other animals that fed on death as
spies; Shadoweyes, the Aiel called them. These barely paused in the frenzied feeding until they fell
transfixed with an arrow, but a wise man did not take chances with ravens or rats. “And see that the
dead are buried.” At least in that, right and necessity were the same.

The Gift of a Blade

The camp began to go up quickly, in the mouth of Jangai Pass, if away from Taien, and
spreading over the hills around the approaches, among the scattered thornbushes, and even onto the
slopes of the mountains. Not that anything was very visible except what was inside the pass; Aiel
tents blended into the stony soil so well that you could miss them even when you knew what you were
looking for and where. In the hills the Aiel camped by clan, but those in the pass itself grouped
themselves by society. They were mostly Maidens, but the men’s societies sent their representatives,
too, some fifty each, spreading tents well above the ruins of Taien in slightly separated camps.
Everyone understood, or thought they did, about the Maidens carrying Rand’s honor, but all societies
wanted to guard the Car’a’carn.
Moiraine—and Lan, of course—went to get Kadere’s wagons settled, just below the town; the
Aes Sedai fussed over what was in those wagons nearly as much as she did over Rand. The drivers
muttered and cursed about the town’s smell, and avoided watching the Aiel cut bodies down from the
wall, but after their months in the Waste, they seemed to like being close even to the wreckage of
what they saw as civilization.
Gai’shain were erecting the Wise Ones’ tents—those of Amys and Bair and Melaine—below
the town, astride the faded track that led up out of the hills. Rand was sure they would say they had
chosen the spot to be available to him as well as to the countless dozens of Wise Ones below, but he
thought it no coincidence that anyone coming up from the hills to him would have to go through or
around their camp to reach him. He was a little surprised to see Melaine directing the white-robed
figures. Only three nights before, she had married Bael, in a ceremony that made her his wife and
first-sister to his other wife, Dorindha. That part had been just as important as the marriage,
apparently; Aviendha had been shocked at his surprise, or maybe angry.
When Egwene arrived with Aviendha up behind her on the gray mare, those full skirts pushed
above their knees, they looked a matched pair despite their different coloring and Aviendha being tall
enough to look over Egwene’s shoulder without stretching, each with just one ivory bracelet and one
necklace. The work of removing the hanged corpses had barely begun. Most of the ravens lay dead,
bundles of black feathers littering the ground, and the rest had flown, but vultures too gorged to flap
aloft still waddled through the ashes inside the walls.
Rand wished that there was some way he could keep the two women from having to see, but to
his surprise, neither went running to empty her stomach. Well, he had not really expected anything of
the sort from Aviendha; she had seen death often enough, and dealt it out, too, and her face remained
expressionless. But he had not expected the pure pity in Egwene’s eyes as she gazed at the bloated
dead coming down.

She drew Mist over to Jeade’en and leaned to put a hand on his arm. “I am so sorry, Rand. There
was no way you could have stopped this.”
“I know,” he told her. He had not even known there was a town here until Rhuarc mentioned it
casually five days ago—his councils with the chiefs had all been on whether they could cover more
ground in a day, and what Couladin would do when he cleared the Jangai—and by that time the
Shaido had finished here and gone. He had done with cursing himself for a fool then.
“Well, just you remember it. It was not your fault.” She heeled Mist on, and began talking to
Aviendha before she was out of earshot. “I am glad he is taking it so well. He has the habit of feeling
guilty over things he cannot control.”
“Men always believe they are in control of everything around them,” Aviendha replied. “When
they find out they are not, they think they have failed, instead of learning a simple truth women already
know.”
Egwene giggled. “That is the simple truth. Once I saw those poor people, I thought we would
find him heaving somewhere.”
“Is his stomach so tender? I . . .”
Their voices faded away as the mare ambled on. Rand pulled himself back upright in the saddle,
flushing. Trying to eavesdrop on them; he was behaving like an idiot. That did not stop him frowning
at their departing backs. He only took responsibility for what he was accountable for, if only to
himself. Just for things he could do something about. And what he should have done something about.
He did not like them talking about him. Behind his back, or under his nose. The Light only knew what
they were saying.
Dismounting, he led Jeade’en in search of Asmodean, who seemed to have wandered off. After
so many days in the saddle, it was good to walk. Various clusters of tents were springing up along the
pass; the mountain slopes and cliffs made formidable barriers, but the Aiel still arranged themselves
as if they could expect attack from them. He had tried walking with the Aiel, but half a day was
enough to put him back on the horse. It was hard enough to keep up with them mounted; they could
wear out horses when they pressed.
Mat was down, too, squatting with his reins in one hand and that black-hafted spear across his
knees, peering at the gaping gates, studying the town and muttering to himself while Pips tried to
nibble at a thornbush. Mat was studying, not just staring. Where had that remark about sentries come
from? Mat said odd things at times now, since their first visit to Rhuidean. Rand wished that he were
willing to talk about what had happened, but he still denied that anything had, despite the foxhead
medallion, the spear, and that scar around his neck. Melindhra, the Shaido Maiden that Mat had taken
up with, was off to one side, watching Mat, until Sulin came and chased her away on some errand.
Rand wondered if Mat knew the Maidens were laying bets on whether Melindhra would give up the
spear for him. And on whether she would teach him to sing, too, though they only laughed when Rand
asked what that meant.
The sound of music drew him to Asmodean, seated by himself on a granite outcrop with his harp
on his knee. The crimson banner’s staff had been twisted into the rocky soil, and the mule tethered to
it. “You see, my Lord Dragon,” he said cheerfully, “your bannerman keeps loyally to his duties.” His
voice and expression changed, and he said, “If you must have this thing, why not let Mat carry it, or
Lan? Or Moiraine, for that matter? She would be glad to carry your banner, and clean your boots. Be
careful of her. She is a devious woman. When a woman says she will obey you, of her own will, it is
time to sleep lightly and watch your back.”
“You carry it because you were chosen, Master Jasin Natael.” Asmodean gave a start and

looked around, though everyone else was too far away, and too busy, to be listening. None but they
two would have understood, anyway. “What do you know about those ruins up near the snow line?
They must come from the Age of Legends.”
Asmodean did not even glance up the mountain. “This world is very changed from the world I
. . . went to sleep in.” He sounded weary, and he shivered slightly. “What I know of what lies where,
I have learned since waking.” The mournful sounds of “The March of Death” rose from his harp.
“That could be what is left of the city where I was born, for all I know. Shorelle was a port.”
The sun had maybe an hour before the Spine of the World hid it; this close to high mountains,
night came early. “I am too tired for one of our discussions tonight.” That was what they called
Asmodean’s lessons in public, even when no one was around. Added to practice sessions with Lan or
Rhuarc, those lessons had left him little time for sleep since leaving Rhuidean. “You take to your tent
when you’re ready, and I will see you in the morning. With the banner.” There was no one else to
carry the bloody thing. Maybe he could find somebody in Cairhien.
As he was turning away, Asmodean plucked something discordant and said, “No burning nets
woven around my tent tonight? Do you finally begin to trust me?”
Rand looked back over his shoulder. “I trust you like a brother. Until the day you betray me. You
have a parole for what you’ve done, in return for your teaching, and a better bargain than you deserve,
but the day you turn against me, I will tear it up and bury it with you.” Asmodean opened his mouth,
but Rand forestalled him. “That is me talking, Natael. Rand al’Thor. Two Rivers folk don’t like
people who try to stab them in the back.”
Irritably, he pulled at the dapple’s reins and went on before the other man could say anything. He
was not sure whether Asmodean had any inkling that a dead man was trying to take him over, but he
should not let himself give the man hints. Asmodean was sure enough already that his was a helpless
cause; if he began to think that Rand was not in full control of his own mind, perhaps that he was
going mad, the Forsaken would abandon him in a heartbeat, and there was too much Rand had to learn
yet.
White-robed gai’shain were erecting his tent under Aviendha’s direction, well into the pass
mouth, with that huge carved snake fearing above. The gai’shain had their own tents, but those would
be the last erected, of course. Adelin and a dozen or so Maidens squatted nearby, watching, waiting
to guard his sleep. Even with over a thousand Maidens encamped around him every night, they still
put a guard on his tent.
Before approaching, he reached out through the angreal in his coat pocket to seize saidin. There
was no need to actually touch the carving of the fat little man with a sword, of course. Mingled filth
and sweetness filled him, that raging river of fire, that crushing avalanche of ice. Channeling as he
had done every night since leaving Rhuidean, he set wards around the entire encampment, not only
what was in the pass but every tent in the hills below as well, and on the slopes of the mountains. He
needed the angreal to set wardings so large, but only just. He had thought that he was strong before,
but Asmodean’s teachings were making him stronger. No human or animal crossing the line of that
ward would notice anything, but Shadowspawn that touched it would sound a warning that everyone
in the tents would hear. Had he done this in Rhuidean, the Darkhounds could never have entered
without him knowing.
The Aiel themselves would have to keep watch for human enemies. Wardings were complex
weaves, if tenuous, and trying to make them do more than one thing could render them useless, in
practicality. He could have made this one to kill Shadowspawn instead of merely giving warning, but
that would have been like a beacon to any male Forsaken who might be searching, and to Myrddraal,

too. No need to bring his enemies down on him when they might not know where he was. This, even
one of the Forsaken would not know until he was close, and a Myrddraal not until it was too late.
Letting go of saidin was an exercise in self-control, despite the foulness of the taint, despite the
way the Power tried to scour him away like sand on a riverbed, to burn him, obliterate him. He
floated in the vast emptiness of the Void, yet he could feel the air stirring against each hair on his
head, see the weave of the gai’shain’s robes, smell Aviendha’s warm scent. He wanted more. But he
could smell the ashes of Taien, too, smell the dead who had been burned, the corruption of those who
had not, even the ones already buried, mingled with the dry soil of their graves. That helped. For a
while after saidin was gone, all he did was take deep breaths of hot, arid air; compared to before, the
whiff of death seemed absent, and the air itself pure and wonderful.
“Look what was here before us,” Aviendha said as he let a meek-faced white-robed woman take
Jeade’en. She held up a brown snake, dead, but as thick as his forearm and nearly three paces long.
The bloodsnake took its name from the effect of its bite, turning the blood to jelly in minutes. Unless
he missed his guess, the neat wound behind its head had come from her belt knife. Adelin and the
other Maidens looked approving.
“Did you ever for one minute think that it could have bitten you?” he said. “Did you ever think of
using the Power instead of a bloody belt knife? Why didn’t you kiss it first? You had to be close
enough.”
She drew herself up, and her big green eyes should have brought on the night’s chill early. “The
Wise Ones say it is not good to use the Power too often.” The clipped words were as cold as her
eyes. “They say it is possible to draw too much and harm yourself.” Frowning slightly, she added,
more to herself than him, “Though I have not come near what I can hold yet. I am sure of it.”
Shaking his head, he ducked into the tent. The woman would not listen to reason.
No sooner had he settled himself against a silk cushion near the still unlit fire than she followed
him. Without the bloodsnake, thankfully, but gingerly carrying something long wrapped in thick layers
of gray-striped blanket. “You were worried for me,” she said in a flat voice. There was no
expression at all on her face.
“Of course not,” he lied. Fool woman. She’ll get herself killed yet because she doesn’t have
the sense to be careful when it’s needed. “I’d have been as worried for anyone. I would not want
anyone bitten by a bloodsnake.”
For a moment she eyed him doubtfully, then gave a quick nod. “Good. So long as you do not
presume toward me.” Tossing the bundled blanket at his feet, she sat on her heels across the firepit
from him. “You would not accept the buckle as canceling debt between us . . .”
“Aviendha, there is no debt.” He thought that she had forgotten about that. She went on as if he
had not spoken.
“. . . but perhaps that will cancel it.”
Sighing, he unwrapped the striped blanket—warily, since she had held it far more uneasily than
she had the snake; she had held the bloody snake as if it were a piece of cloth—unwrapped it, and
gasped. What lay inside was a sword, the scabbard so encrusted with rubies and moonstones that it
was hard to see the gold except where a rising sun of many rays had been inset. The ivory hilt, long
enough for two hands, had another inlaid rising sun in gold; the pommel was thick with rubies and
moonstones, and still more made a solid mass along the quillons. This had never been made to use,
only to be seen. To be stared at.
“This must have cost . . . Aviendha, how could you pay for it?”
“It cost little,” she said, so defensively that she might as well have added that she lied.

“A sword. How did you ever come by a sword? How did any Aiel come by a sword? Don’t tell
me Kadere had this hidden in his wagons.”
“I carried it in a blanket.” She sounded even more touchy now than she had about the price.
“Even Bair said that would make it all right, so long as I did not actually touch it.” She shrugged
uncomfortably, shifting and reshifting her shawl. “It was the treekiller’s sword. Laman’s. It was taken
from his body as proof that he was dead, because his head could not be brought back so far. Since
then it has passed from hand to hand, young men or fool Maidens who wanted to own the proof of his
death. Only, each began to think of what it was, and soon sold it to another fool. The price has come
down very far since it first was sold. No Aiel would lay hand to it even to remove the stones.”
“Well, it is very beautiful,” he said, as tactfully as he could manage. Only a buffoon would carry
something this gaudy. And that ivory hilt would twist in a hand slippery with sweat or blood. “But I
cannot let you . . .” He trailed off as he bared a few inches of the blade, out of habit, to examine the
edge. Etched into the shining steel stood a heron, symbol of a blademaster. He had carried a sword
marked like that once. Suddenly he was ready to bet that this blade was like it, like the raven-marked
blade on Mat’s spear, metal made with Power that would never break and never need sharpening.
Most blademasters’ swords were only copies of those. Lan could tell him for certain, but he was sure
already in his own mind.
Pulling the scabbard off, he leaned across the firepit to place it in front of her. “I will take the
blade to cancel the debt, Aviendha.” It was long and slightly curved, with a single edge. “Just the
blade. You can have the hilt back, too.” He could have a new hilt and scabbard made in Cairhien.
Maybe one of Taien’s survivors was a decent bladesmith.
She stared wide-eyed from the scabbard to him and back, mouth open, stunned for the first time
that he had ever seen. “But those gems are worth much, much more than I—You are trying to put me in
your debt again, Rand al’Thor.”
“Not so.” If this blade had lain untouched, and untarnished, in its scabbard for over twenty years,
it had to be what he thought. “I did not accept the scabbard, so it has been yours all along.” Tossing
one of the silk cushions into the air, he executed the seated version of the form called Low Wind
Rising; feathers rained down as the blade sliced neatly through. “And I don’t accept the hilt, either, so
that’s yours, too. If you have made a profit, it’s your own doing.”
Instead of looking happy at her good fortune—he suspected she had given everything that she had
for the sword, and likely gotten back a hundred times as much or more in the scabbard alone—instead
of seeming glad, or thanking him, she glared through the feathers as indignantly as any goodwife in the
Two Rivers seeing her floor littered. Stiffly, she clapped, and one of the gai’shain appeared,
immediately going to her knees to begin cleaning up the mess.
“It is my tent,” he said pointedly. Aviendha sniffed at him in perfect imitation of Egwene. Those
two women were definitely spending too much time together.
Supper, when it came at full dark, consisted of the usual flat pale bread, and a spicy stew of
dried peppers and beans with chunks of nearly white meat. He only grinned at her when he learned
that it was the bloodsnake; he had eaten snake and worse since coming to the Waste. Gara—the
poisonous lizard—was the worst in his estimation; not for the taste, which was rather like chicken,
but because it was lizard. It sometimes seemed that there must be more poisonous things—snakes,
lizards, spiders, plants—in the Waste than in the rest of the world combined.
Aviendha appeared disappointed that he did not spit the stew out in disgust, though sometimes it
was difficult to tell what she was feeling. At times she seemed to take great pleasure in discomfiting
him. Had he been trying to pretend that he was Aiel, he would have thought she was trying to prove he

was not.
Tired and eager for sleep, he only took off his coat and boots before crawling into his blankets
and turning his back to Aviendha. Aielmen and-women might take sweatbaths together, but a short
time in Shienar, where they did something much the same, had convinced him that he was not made
for that sort of thing, not without going so red in the face that he died of it. He tried not to listen to the
rustle of her undressing beneath her own blankets. At least she had that much modesty, but he kept his
back turned anyway, just in case.
She claimed she was supposed to sleep there to continue his lessons on Aiel ways and customs,
since he spent so much of his days with the chiefs. They both knew that was a lie, though what the
Wise Ones thought she could find out this way, he could not imagine. She gave little grunts every now
and then as she tugged at something, and muttered to herself.
To cover the sounds, and stop himself thinking of what they must mean, he said, “Melaine’s
wedding was impressive. Did Bael really know nothing about it until Melaine and Dorindha told
him?”
“Of course not,” she replied scornfully, pausing for what he thought was a stocking coming off.
“Why should he know before Melaine laid the bridal wreath at his feet and asked him?” Abruptly she
laughed. “Melaine nearly drove herself and Dorindha to distraction finding segade blossoms for the
wreath. Few grow so close to the Dragonwall.”
“Does that mean something special? Segade blossoms?” That was what he had sent her, the
flowers she had never acknowledged.
“That she has a prickly nature and means to keep it.” Another pause, broken by mutters. “Had
she used leaves or flowers from sweetroot, it would have meant she claimed a sweet nature. Morning
drop would mean she would be submissive, and . . . There are too many to list. It would take me days
to teach all the combinations to you, and you do not need to know them. You will not have an Aiel
wife. You belong to Elayne.”
He nearly looked at her when she said “submissive.” A word less likely to describe any Aiel
woman he could not conceive. Probably means she gives warning before she stabs you.
There had been more of a muffled sound to her voice at the end. Pulling her blouse over her
head, he realized. He wished the lamps were out. No, that would have made it worse. But then, he
had been through this every single night since Rhuidean, and every single night it was worse. He had
to put an end to it. The woman was going to sleep with the Wise Ones, where she belonged, from now
on; he would learn what he could from her as he could. He had thought exactly the same thing for
fifteen nights now.
Trying to chase the pictures out of his head, he said, “That bit at the end. After the vows were
said.” No sooner had half a dozen Wise Ones pronounced their blessings than a hundred of Melaine’s
blood kin had rushed in to surround her, all carrying their spears. A hundred of Bael’s kin had rallied
to him, and he had fought his way to her. No one had been veiled, of course—it was all part of custom
—but blood had still been shed on both sides. “A few minutes before, Melaine was vowing that she
loved him, but when he reached her, she fought like a cornered ridgecat.” If Dorindha had not
punched her in the shortribs, he did not think Bael would ever have gotten her over his shoulder to
carry off. “He still has the limp and the black eye she gave him.”
“Should she have been a weakling?” Aviendha said sleepily. “He had to know the worth of her.
She was not a trinket for him to put in his pouch.” She yawned, and he heard her nestling deeper into
her blankets.
“What does ‘teaching a man to sing’ mean?” Aielmen did not sing, not once they were old

enough to take up a spear, except for battle chants and laments for the dead.
“You are thinking of Mat Cauthon?” She actually giggled. “Sometimes, a man gives up the spear
for a Maiden.”
“You’re making that up. I never heard of anything like that.”
“Well, it is not really giving up the spear.” Her voice held a thick muzziness. “Sometimes a man
desires a Maiden who will not give up the spear for him, and he arranges to be taken gai’shain by
her. He is a fool, of course. No Maiden would look at gai’shain as he hopes. He is worked hard and
kept strictly to his place, and the first thing that is done is to make him learn to sing, to entertain the
spear-sisters while they eat. ‘She is going to teach him to sing.’ That is what Maidens say when a man
makes a fool of himself over one of the spear-sisters.” A very peculiar people.
“Aviendha?” He had said he was not going to ask her this again. Lan said it was Kandori work,
a pattern called snowflakes. Probably loot from some raid up north. “Who gave you that necklace?”
“A friend, Rand al’Thor. We came far today, and you will start us early tomorrow. Sleep well
and wake, Rand al’Thor.” Only an Aiel would wish you a good night by hoping you did not die in
your sleep.
Setting the much smaller if much more intricate ward on his dreams, he channeled the lamps out
and tried to sleep. A friend. The Reyn came from the north. But she had had the necklace in Rhuidean.
Why did he care? Aviendha’s slow breathing seemed loud in his ears until he fell asleep, and then he
dreamed a confused dream of Min and Elayne helping him throw Aviendha, wearing nothing but that
necklace, over his shoulder, while she beat him over the head with a wreath of segade blossoms.

CHAPTER

Birdcalls by Night

Lying facedown on his blankets with his eyes closed, Mat luxuriated in the feel of Melindhra’s
thumbs kneading their way down his spine. There was nothing quite as good as a massage after a long
day in the saddle. Well, some things were, but right then, he was willing to settle for her thumbs.
“You are well muscled for such a short man, Matrim Cauthon.”
He opened one eye and glanced back at her, kneeling astride his hips. She had built the fire up
twice as high as needed, and sweat trickled down her body. Her fine golden hair, close-cut except for
that Aiel tail at the nape of her neck, clung to her scalp. “If I’m too short, you can always find
somebody else.”
“You are not too short for my taste,” she laughed, ruffling his hair. It was longer than hers. “And
you are cute. Relax. This does no good if you tense.”
Grunting, he closed his eyes again. Cute? Light! And short. Only Aiel could call him short. In
every other land he had been in, he was taller than most men, if not always by much. He could
remember being tall. Taller than Rand, when he rode against Artur Hawkwing. And a hand shorter
than he was now when he fought beside Maecine against the Aelgari. He had spoken to Lan, claiming
he had overheard some names; the Warder said Maecine had been a king of Eharon, one of the Ten
Nations—that much Mat already knew—some four or five hundred years before the Trolloc Wars.
Lan doubted that even the Brown Ajah knew more; much had been lost in the Trolloc Wars, and more
in the War of the Hundred Years. Those were the earliest and latest of the memories that had been
planted in his skull. Nothing after Artur Paendrag Tanreall, and nothing before Maecine of Eharon.
“Are you cold?” Melindhra said incredulously. “You shivered.” She scrambled off him, and he
heard her add wood to the fire; there was enough scrub here for burning. She slapped his bottom hard
as she climbed back on, murmuring, “Good muscle.”
“If you keep on like that,” he muttered, “I’ll think you mean to spit me for supper, like a
Trolloc.” It was not that he did not enjoy Melindhra—as long as she refrained from pointing out that
she was taller, anyway—but the situation made him uncomfortable.
“No spits for you, Matrim Cauthon.” Her thumbs dug hard into his shoulder. “That is it. Relax.”
He supposed that he would marry someday, settle down. That was what you did. A woman, a
house, a family. Shackled to one spot for the rest of his life. I never heard of a wife yet that liked her
husband having a drink or a gamble. And there was what those folk on the other side of the
doorframe ter’angreal had said. That he was fated “to marry the Daughter of the Nine Moons.” A
man has to marry sooner or later, I suppose. But he certainly did not mean to take an Aiel wife. He
wanted to dance with as many women as he could, while he could.
“You are not made for spits, but for great honor, I think,” Melindhra said softly.
“Sounds fine to me.” Only now he could not get another woman to look at him, not the Maidens

or the others. It was as if Melindhra had hung a sign on him saying OWNED BY M ELINDHRA OF THE JUM AI
SHAIDO. Well, she would not have put that last bit on, not here. Then again, who knew what an Aiel
would do, especially a Maiden of the Spear? Women did not think the same as men, and Aielwomen
did not think like anybody else in the world.
“It is strange that you efface yourself so.”
“Efface myself?” he mumbled. Her hands did feel good; knots were coming out that he had not
known were there. “How?” He wondered if it had something to do with that necklace. Melindhra
seemed to set great store by it, or by receiving it, anyway. She never wore the thing, of course.
Maidens did not. But she carried it in her pouch, and showed it to every woman who asked. A lot of
them seemed to.
“You put yourself in the shadow of Rand al’Thor.”
“I’m not in anybody’s shadow,” he said absently. It could not be the necklace. He had given
jewelry to other women, Maidens and others; he liked giving things to pretty women, even if all he
got in return was a smile. He never expected more. If a woman did not enjoy a kiss and a cuddle as
much as he did, what was the point?
“Of course, there is honor of a sort in being in the shadow of the Car’a’carn. To be near the
mighty, you must stand in their shade.”
“Shade,” Mat agreed, not really hearing. Sometimes the women accepted and sometimes not, but
none had decided they owned him. That was what rankled, really. He was not about to be owned by
any woman, however pretty she was. And no matter how good her hands were at loosening knotted
muscles.
“Your scars should be scars of honor, earned in your own name, as a chief, not this.” One finger
traced along the hanging scar on his neck. “Did you earn this serving the Car’a’carn?”
Shrugging her hand away, he pushed up on his elbows and twisted to look at her. “Are you sure
‘Daughter of the Nine Moons’ doesn’t mean anything to you?”
“I have told you it does not. Lie down.”
“If you are lying to me, I swear I’ll welt your rump.”
Hands on hips, she looked down at him dangerously. “Do you think that you can . . . welt my
rump, Mat Cauthon?”
“I’ll give it my best try.” She would probably put a spear through his ribs. “Do you swear
you’ve never heard of the Daughter of the Nine Moons?”
“I never have,” she said slowly. “Who is she? Or what? Lie down, and let me—”
A blackbird called, seemingly everywhere in the tent and outside as well, and a moment later, a
redwing. Good Two Rivers birds. Rand had chosen his warnings from what he knew, birds not found
in the Waste.
Melindhra was off him in an instant, wrapping her shoufa around her head, veiling herself as she
snatched up spears and bucklers. She darted from the tent like that.
“Blood and bloody ashes!” Mat muttered as he struggled into his breeches. A redwing meant the
south. He and Melindhra had put up their tent to the south, with the Chareen, as far from Rand as they
could get and stay in the encampment. But he was not going outside in those thornbushes naked, the
way Melindhra had. The blackbird meant north, where the Shaarad were camped; they were coming
from two sides at once.
Stamping his feet in his boots as best he could in the low tent, he looked at the silver foxhead
lying beside his blankets. Shouts were rising outside, the clash of metal on metal. He had finally
figured out that that medallion had somehow kept Moiraine from Healing him on her first try. So long

as he had been touching it, her channeling had not affected him. He had never heard of Shadowspawn
able to channel, but there was always the Black Ajah—so Rand said, and he believed it—and always
the chance that one of the Forsaken had finally come after Rand. Pulling the leather thong over his
head so the medallion hung on his chest, he snatched up his raven-marked spear and ducked out into
cold moonlight.
He had no time to feel the icy chill. Before he was completely out of the tent, he almost lost his
head to a scythe-curved Trolloc sword. The blade brushed his hair as he threw himself into a low
dive, rolling to his feet with the spear ready.
At first glance in the darkness, the Trolloc might have been a bulky man, though half again as tall
as any Aiel man, garbed all in black mail with spikes at elbows and shoulders, and a helmet with
goat’s horns attached. But these horns grew out of that too human head, and below the eyes a goat’s
muzzle thrust out.
Snarling, the Trolloc lunged at him, and howled in a harsh language never meant for a human
tongue. Mat spun his spear like a quarterstaff, knocking the heavy, curved blade to one side, and thrust
his long spearpoint into the creature’s middle, mail parting for that Power-made steel as easily as the
flesh beneath. The goat-snouted Trolloc folded over with a harsh cry, and Mat pulled his weapon
free, dodging aside as it fell.
All around him Aiel, some unclothed or only half but all black-veiled, fought Trollocs with
tusked boars’ snouts or wolves’ muzzles or eagles’ beaks, some with heads horned or crested with
feathers, wielding those oddly curved swords and spiked axes, hooked tridents and spears. Here and
there one used a huge bow to shoot barbed arrows the size of small spears. Men fought alongside the
Trollocs, too, in rough coats, with swords, shouting desperately as they died among the thornbushes.
“Sammael!”
“Sammael and the Golden Bees!”
The Darkfriends were dying, most as soon as they engaged an Aiel, but the Trollocs died harder.
“I am no bloody hero!” Mat shouted to no one in particular as he battled a Trolloc with a bear’s
muzzle and hairy ears, his third. The creature carried a long-handled axe, with half a dozen sharp
spikes and a flaring blade big enough to split a tree, throwing it about like a toy in those great hairy
hands. It was being near Rand that got Mat into these things. All he wanted from life was some good
wine, a game of dice, and a pretty girl or three. “I don’t want to be mixed up in this!” Especially not if
Sammael was around. “Do you hear me?”
The Trolloc went down with a ruined throat, and he found himself facing a Myrddraal, just as it
finished killing two Aiel who had come at it together. The Halfman looked like a man, pasty pale,
armored in black overlapping scales like a snake’s. It moved like a snake, too, boneless and fluid and
quick, night-black cloak hanging still however it darted. And it had no eyes. Just a dead-white sweep
of skin where eyes should be.
That eyeless gaze turned on him, and he shivered, fear oozing along his bones. “The look of the
Eyeless is fear,” they said in the Borderlands, where they should know, and even Aiel admitted that a
Myrddraal’s stare sent chills through the marrow. That was the creature’s first weapon. The Halfman
came at him in a flowing run.
With a roar, Mat rushed to meet it, spear spinning like a quarterstaff, thrusting, ever moving. The
thing carried a blade as dark as its cloak, a sword hammered at the forges of Thakan’dar, and if that
cut him, he was as good as dead unless Moiraine appeared quickly with her Healing. But there was
only one sure way to take down a Fade. All-out attack; you had to overwhelm it before it
overwhelmed you, and a thought for defense could be a good way to die. He could not even spare a

glance for the battle raging around him in the night.
The Myrddraal’s blade flickered like a serpent’s tongue, darted like black lightning, but to
counter Mat’s attack. When raven-marked Power-wrought steel met Thakan’dar-made metal, blue
light flashed around them, a crackle of sheet lightning.
Suddenly Mat’s slashing attack struck flesh. Black sword and pale hand flew away, and the
reverse stroke sliced open the Myrddraal’s throat, but Mat did not stop. Thrust through the heart, cut
to one hamstring, then the other, all in rapid succession. Only then did he step away from the thing
still thrashing on the ground, flailing about with its good hand and severed stump, wounds spilling
inky blood. Halfmen took a long time to admit that they were dead; they did not die completely except
with a setting sun.
Looking around, Mat realized that the attack was over. Whatever Darkfriends or Trollocs were
not dead, had fled; at least, he saw none standing except Aiel. Some of them were down, too. He
plucked a kerchief from the neck of a Darkfriend corpse to wipe the Myrddraal’s black blood from
his spearpoint. It would etch the metal if left too long.
This night assault made no sense. By the bodies he could see in the moonlight, Trolloc and
human, none had made it much past the first line of tents. And without far greater numbers, they could
not have hoped for more.
“What was that you called out? Carai something. The Old Tongue?”
He turned to look at Melindhra. She had unveiled, but she still wore not a stitch more than her
shoufa. There were other Maidens about, and men, wearing as little, and showing as little concern,
though most did seem to be heading back to their tents without lingering. They had no modesty, that
was it. No modesty at all. She did not even seem to feel the cold, though her breath made wisps of
mist. He was as sweaty as she, and freezing now that he had no fight for his life to occupy his mind.
“Something I heard once,” he told her. “I liked the sound of it.” Carai an Caldazar! For the
honor of the Red Eagle. The battle cry of Manetheren. Most of his memories were from Manetheren.
Some of those he had had before the twisted doorway. Moiraine said it was the Old Blood coming
out. Just as long as it did not come out of his veins.
She put an arm around his shoulders as he started back toward their tent. “I saw you with the
Nightrunner, Mat Cauthon.” That was one of the Aiel names for Myrddraal. “You are as tall as a man
needs to be.”
Grinning, he slipped his arm around her waist, but he could not get the attack out of his head. He
wanted to—his thoughts were too snarled in his borrowed memories—but he could not. Why had
anyone launched such a hopeless assault? No one but a fool attacked overwhelming force without a
reason. That was the thought he could not pry out of his head. No one attacked without a reason.
The birdcalls pulled Rand awake immediately, and he seized saidin as he tossed the blankets
aside and ran out, coatless, in his stockinged feet. The night was cold and moonlit, faint sounds of
battle drifting up from the hills below the pass. Around him, Aiel stirred like scurrying ants, rushing
into the night to where an attack might come here in the pass. The wards would signal again—
Shadowspawn in the pass would cause a winterfinch to call—until he unraveled them in the morning,
but there was no point in taking foolish chances.
Soon the pass was still again, the gai’shain in their tents, forbidden weapons even now, the
other Aiel off at the places that might need defending. Even Adelin and the other Maidens had gone,
as if they knew he would have held them back if they waited. He could hear a few mutters from the
wagons near the town walls, but neither the drivers nor Kadere showed themselves; he did not expect

them to. The faint sounds of battle—men shouting, screaming, dying—came from two directions. Both
below, well away from him. People were out around the Wise Ones’ tents, too; staring toward the
fighting, it seemed.
An attack down there made no sense. It was not the Miagoma, not unless Timolan had taken
Shadowspawn into his clan, and that was as likely as Whitecloaks recruiting Trollocs. He turned
back toward his tent, and even enclosed in the Void he gave a start.
Aviendha had come out into the moonlight, a blanket wrapped around her. Just beyond her stood
a tall man shrouded in a dark cloak; moonshadows drifted over a gaunt face that was too pale, with
eyes too large. A crooning rose, and the cloak opened into wide, leathery wings like those of a bat.
Moving as in a dream, Aviendha drifted toward the waiting embrace.
Rand channeled, and finger-thin balefire burned past her, an arrow of solid light, to take the
Draghkar in the head. The effect of that narrower stream was slower, but no less sure than with the
Darkhounds. The creature’s colors reversed, black to white, white to black, and it became sparkling
motes that melted in air.
Aviendha shook herself as the crooning ended, stared at the last particles as they vanished, and
turned to Rand, gathering the blanket closer. Her hand came up, and a stream of fire as thick as his
head roared toward him.
Startled even inside the emptiness, never thinking of the Power, he threw himself to the ground
beneath the billowing flames. They died in an instant.
“What are you doing?” he barked, so angry, so shocked, that the Void cracked and saidin
vanished from him. He scrambled to his feet, stalking toward her. “This tops any ingratitude I ever
heard of!” He was going to shake her until her teeth rattled. “I just saved your life, in case you failed
to notice, and if I offended some bloody Aiel custom, I don’t give a—!”
“The next time,” she snapped back, “I will leave the great Car’a’carn to deal with matters by
himself!” Awkwardly clutching the blanket close, she ducked stiff-backed into the tent.
For the first time, he looked behind him. At another Draghkar, crumpled on the ground in flames.
He had been so angry that he had not heard the crackling and popping as it burned, had not smelled the
odor of burning grease. He had not even sensed the evil of it. A Draghkar killed by first sucking the
soul away, and then life. It had to be close, touching, but this one lay no more than two paces from
where he had been standing. He was not certain how effective a Draghkar’s crooning embrace was
against someone filled with saidin, but he was glad he had not found out.
Drawing a deep breath, he knelt beside the tent flap. “Aviendha?” He could not go in. A lamp
was lit in there, and she could be sitting there naked for all he knew, mentally ripping him up and
down the way he deserved. “Aviendha, I am sorry. I apologize. I was a fool to speak as I did without
asking why. I should know that you wouldn’t harm me, and I . . . I . . . I’m a fool,” he finished weakly.
“A great deal you know, Rand al’Thor,” came a muffled reply. “You are a fool!”
How did Aiel apologize? He had never asked her that. Considering ji’e’toh, teaching men to
sing, and wedding customs, he did not think he would. “Yes, I am. And I apologize.” There was no
answer this time. “Are you in your blankets?” Silence.
Muttering to himself, he stood, working his stockinged toes on the icy ground. He was going to
have to remain out here until he was sure she was decently covered. Without boots or coat. He seized
hold of saidin, taint and all, just to be distanced from the bone-grinding cold, inside the Void.
The three Wise One dreamwalkers came running, of course, and Egwene, all staring at the
burning Draghkar as they skirted it, drawing their shawls around them with almost the same motion.
“Only one,” Amys said. “I thank the Light, but I am surprised.”

“There were two,” Rand told her. “I . . . destroyed the other.” Why should he be hesitant just
because Moiraine had warned him against bale-fire? It was a weapon like any other. “If Aviendha
had not killed this one, it might have gotten me.”
“The feel of her channeling drew us,” Egwene said, looking him up and down. At first he thought
she was checking for injuries, but she paid special attention to his stockinged feet, then glanced at the
tent, where a crack in the tent flap showed lamplight. “You’ve upset her again, haven’t you? She
saved your life, and you . . . Men!” With a disgusted shake of her head, she brushed past him and into
the tent. He heard faint voices, but could not make out what was being said.
Melaine gave a hitch to her shawl. “If you do not need us, then we must see what is happening
below.” She hurried off without waiting for the other two.
Bair cackled as she and Amys followed. “A wager on who she will check on first? My amethyst
necklace that you like so much against that sapphire bracelet of yours?”
“Done. I choose Dorindha.”
The older Wise One cackled again. “Her eyes are still full of Bael. A first-sister is a first-sister,
but a new husband . . .”
They moved on out of earshot, and he bent toward the tent flap. He still could not hear what they
were saying, not unless he stuck his ear to the crack, and he was not about to do that. Surely Aviendha
had covered herself with Egwene in there. Then again, the way Egwene had taken to Aiel ways, it
was just as likely she had peeled out of her clothes instead.
The soft sound of slippers announced Moiraine and Lan, and Rand straightened. Though he could
hear both of them breathing, the Warder’s steps still made barely an audible noise. Moiraine’s hair
hung about her face, and she held a dark robe around her, the silk shining with the moon. Lan was
fully dressed, booted and armed, wrapped in that cloak that made him part of the night. Of course. The
clamor of fighting was dying down in the hills below.
“I am surprised you were not here sooner, Moiraine.” His voice sounded cold, but better his
voice than him. He held onto saidin, fought it, and the night’s icy chill remained something far off. He
was aware of it, aware of each hair on his arms stirring with cold beneath his shirtsleeves, but it did
not touch him. “You usually come looking for me as soon as you sense trouble.”
“I have never explained all that I do or do not do.” Her voice was as coolly mysterious as it had
ever been, yet even in the moonlight Rand was certain that she was blushing. Lan looked troubled,
though with him it was difficult to tell. “I cannot hold your hand forever. Eventually, you must walk
alone.”
“I did that tonight, didn’t I?” Embarrassment slid across the Void—that sounded as though he
had done everything himself—and he added, “Aviendha all but took that one off my back.” The flames
on the Draghkar were burning low.
“As well she was here, then,” Moiraine said calmly. “You did not need me.”
She had not been afraid, of that he was sure. He had seen her rush into the midst of
Shadowspawn, wielding the Power as skillfully as Lan did his sword, seen it too often to believe fear
in her. So why had she not come when she sensed the Draghkar? She could have, and Lan as well; that
was one of the gifts a Warder received from the bond between him and an Aes Sedai. He could make
her tell, catch her between her oath to him and her inability to lie straight out. No, he could not. Or
would not. He would not do that to someone who was trying to help him.
“At least now we know what the attack below was about,” he said. “To make me think
something important was happening there while the Draghkar slipped in on me. They tried that at
Cold Rocks Hold, and it did not work there either.” Only, maybe it almost had, this time. If that had

been the intent. “You would think they would try something different.” Couladin ahead of him; the
Forsaken everywhere, it seemed. Why could he not face one enemy at a time?
“Do not make the mistake of thinking the Forsaken simple,” Moiraine said. “That could easily be
fatal.” She shifted her robe as though wishing it were thicker. “The hour is late. If you have no further
need of me . . . ?”
Aiel began to drift back as she and the Warder left. Some exclaimed over the Draghkar, and
roused some of the gai’shain to drag it away, but most simply looked at it before going to their tents.
They seemed to expect such things of him now.
When Adelin and the Maidens appeared, their soft-booted feet dragged. They stared at the
Draghkar being hauled away by white-robed men, and exchanged long looks before approaching
Rand.
“There was nothing here,” Adelin said slowly. “The attack was all below, Darkfriends and
Trollocs.”
“Shouting ‘Sammael and the Golden Bees,’ I heard,” another added. With her head wrapped in a
shoufa, Rand could not make out who she was. She sounded young; some of the Maidens were no
more than sixteen.
Taking a deep breath, Adelin held out one of her spears, horizontally, in front of him, rocksteady. The others did the same, one spear each. “We—I—failed,” Adelin said. “We should have
been here when the Draghkar came. Instead we ran like children to dance the spears.”
“What am I supposed to do with those?” Rand asked, and Adelin replied without hesitation.
“Whatever you wish, Car’a’carn. We stand ready, and will not resist.”
Rand shook his head. Bloody Aiel and their bloody ji’e’toh. “You take those and go back to
guarding my tent. Well? Go.” Looks passed between them before they began to obey, as reluctantly as
they had approached him in the first place. “And one of you tell Aviendha that I will be coming in
when I return,” he added. He was not going to spend the entire night outside wondering whether it
was safe. He stalked away, the stony ground hard under his feet.
Asmodean’s tent was not very far from his. There had not been a sound out of it. He whipped
open the flap and ducked in. Asmodean was sitting in the dark, chewing his lip. He flinched when
Rand appeared, and gave him no chance to speak.
“You did not expect me to take a hand, did you? I felt the Draghkar, but you could deal with
those; you did. I have never liked Draghkar; we should never have made them. They have fewer
brains than a Trolloc. Give them an order, and they still sometimes kill whatever is closest. If I had
come out, if I had done something. . . . What if someone noticed? What if they realized it could not be
you channeling? I—”
“Well for you that you didn’t,” Rand cut him off, sitting cross-legged in the dark. “If I had felt
you full of saidin out there tonight, I might have killed you.”
The other man’s laugh was shaky. “I thought of that, too.”
“It was Sammael who sent the attack tonight. The Trollocs and Darkfriends, anyway.”
“It is not like Sammael to throw men away,” Asmodean said slowly. “But he’ll see ten thousand
dead, or ten times that, if it gains him what he thinks is worth the cost. Maybe one of the others wants
you to think it was him. Even if the Aiel took prisoners . . . Trollocs do not think of much besides
killing, and Darkfriends believe what they are told.”
“It was him. He tried to bait me into attacking him once in the same way, at Serendahar.” Oh,
Light! The thought drifted across the surface of the Void. I said “me.” He did not know where
Serendahar had been, or anything but what he had said. The words had just come out.

After a long silence, Asmodean said quietly, “I never knew that.”
“What I want to know is, why?” Rand chose his words carefully, hoping that they were all his.
He remembered Sammael’s face, a man—Not mine. Not my memory—a compact man with a short
yellow beard. Asmodean had described all the Forsaken, but he knew this image was not made from
that description. Sammael had always wanted to be taller, and resented it that the Power could not
make him so. Asmodean had never told him that. “From what you’ve told me, he is not likely to want
to face me unless he is sure of victory, and maybe not then. You said he’d likely leave me to the Dark
One, if he could. So why is he sure he’ll win now, if I decide to go after him?”
They discussed it in the dark for hours without coming to any conclusion. Asmodean held to the
opinion that it had been one of the others, hoping to send Rand against Sammael and thus get rid of
one or both; at least, Asmodean said that he did. Rand could feel the man’s dark eyes on him,
wondering. That slip had been too big to cover.
When he finally returned to his own tent, Adelin and the dozen Maidens all sprang to their feet,
all of them at once telling him that Egwene was gone and Aviendha long asleep, that she was angry
with him, they both were. They gave so many different pieces of advice on handling the two women’s
anger, all at the same time, that he could understand none of it. Finally they fell silent, looks passing
between them, and Adelin spoke alone.
“We must speak of tonight. Of what we did, and what we failed to do. We—”
“It was nothing,” he told her, “and if it was something, it’s forgiven and forgotten. I would like
to have a few hours’ sleep for once. If you want to discuss it go talk to Amys or Bair. I am sure they’ll
understand what you’re after more than I do.” That shut them up, surprisingly, and let him get inside.
Aviendha was in her blankets, with one slim, bare leg sticking out. He tried not to look at it, or
her. She had left a lamp lit. He climbed into his own blankets gratefully and channeled the lamp out
before releasing saidin. This time he dreamed of Aviendha hurling fire, only she was not hurling it at
a Draghkar, and Sammael was sitting at her side, laughing.

CHAPTER
23

“The Fifth, I Give You”

Reining Mist around on a grassy hilltop, Egwene watched the streams of Aiel coming down
from the Jangai Pass. The saddle had pushed her skirts above her knees again, but she hardly noticed
that now. She could not spend every minute fussing with them. And she had on stockings; it was not as
though she were bare-legged.
In trotting columns the Aiel flowed by below her, arranged by clan and sept and society.
Thousands upon thousands, with their pack horses and mules, the gai’shain who would tend the
camps while the rest fought, spreading a mile wide, and more still in the pass or already out of sight
ahead. Even without families, it seemed a nation on the march. The Silk Path had been a road here, a
full fifty paces wide and paved with broad white stones, slicing straight through hills carved to make
a level. Only occasionally was it visible through the mass of Aiel, although they seemed to prefer
running on the grass, but many of the paving stones had lifted up at a corner or sunk down at one end.
More than twenty years had gone by since this road had carried more than local farmers’ carts and a
handful of wagons.
It was startling to see trees again, real trees, towering oaks and leatherleaf in actual thickets
rather than an occasional wind-twisted, stunted shape, and tall grass waving in the breeze across the
hills. There was real forest to the north, and clouds in the sky, thin and high, yet clouds. The air
seemed blessedly cool after the Waste, and moist, though brown leaves and large brown swaths
through the grass told her that in reality it might be hotter and drier than usual for the time of year.
Still, the countryside of Cairhien was a lush paradise compared to the other side of the Dragonwall.
A small stream meandered north beneath a nearly flat bridge, bordered by the dried clay of a
broader bed; the River Gaelin lay not too many miles away in that direction. She wondered what the
Aiel would make of that river; she had seen Aiel near a river once before. The shrunken band of
water marked a definite break in the steady flow of people, as men and Maidens paused to stare in
amazement before leaping across.
Kadere’s wagons rumbled by on the road, the long mule teams working hard, but still losing
ground to the Aiel. It had taken four days to traverse the twists and turns of the pass, and Rand
apparently intended to go as far into Cairhien as he could in the few hours of daylight remaining.
Moiraine and Lan rode with the wagons; not ahead of them, or even with Kadere’s boxlike little
white house on wheels, but alongside the second wagon, where the canvas-covered shape of the
doorframe ter’angreal made a hump above the rest of the load. Some of the load was wrapped
carefully or packed in boxes or barrels that Kadere had brought into the Waste full of his goods, and
some was simply stuck in wherever it would fit, odd shapes of metal and glass, a red crystal chair,
two child-sized statues of a nude man and woman, rods of bone and ivory and strange black materials
in varying lengths and thicknesses. All sorts of things, including some Egwene could hardly begin to

describe. Moiraine had used every inch of space in all of the wagons.
Egwene wished that she knew why the Aes Sedai was so concerned with that particular wagon;
perhaps no one else had noticed that Moiraine paid it more attention than all the others combined, but
she had. Not that she was likely to find out any time soon. Her newfound equality with Moiraine was
a tender thing, as she had learned when she asked that question, in the heart of the pass, and was told
that her imagination was too vivid and if she had time to spy on the Aes Sedai, perhaps Moiraine
should speak to the Wise Ones about intensifying her training. She had apologized profusely, of
course, and the soft words seemed to have worked. Amys and the others were not taking any more of
her nights than they had before.
A hundred or so Taardad Far Dareis Mai went trotting by on her side of the road, moving
easily, veils hanging but ready to be donned, full quivers at hips. Some carried their curved horn
bows, arrows nocked, while others had their bows cased on their backs, spears and bucklers
swinging rhythmically as they ran. At their rear a dozen gai’shain in their white robes leading pack
mules struggled to keep up. One wore black, not white; Isendre labored hardest of all. Egwene could
pick Adelin out, and two or three others who had been guarding Rand’s tent the night of the attack.
Each clutched a doll in addition to her weapons, a rough-made doll clothed in full skirts and white
blouse; they looked even more stone-faced than usual, trying to pretend that they held no such thing.
She was not sure what that was about. The Maidens who stood that guard had come in a group to
see Bair and Amys when their stint was done, and had spent a long time with them. The next morning,
while camp was still breaking in the grayness before dawn, they had begun making those dolls. She
had not been able to ask, of course, but she had commented on it to one, a red-haired Tomanelle of the
Serai sept named Maira, and the woman said it was to remind her that she was not a child. Her tone
made it clear that she did not want to talk. One of the Maidens carrying a doll was no more than
sixteen, yet Maira was at least as old as Adelin. It made little sense, and that was frustrating. Every
time Egwene thought she understood Aiel ways, something demonstrated that she did not.
Despite herself, her eyes were drawn back to the mouth of the pass. The row of stakes was still
there, just visible, stretching from steep mountain slope to steep mountain slope except where Aiel
had kicked some of them down. Couladin had left another message, men and women impaled across
their path, standing there seven days dead. The tall gray walls of Selean clung to the hills at the right
of the pass, nothing showing above them. Moiraine said it had held only a shadow of its one-time
glory, yet it had still been a considerable town, much larger than Taien; no more remained of it,
however. No survivors, either—except whoever the Shaido had carried off—although here some had
probably run for places they thought safe. There had been farms on these hills; most of eastern
Cairhien had been abandoned after the Aiel War, but a town needed farms for food. Now sootstreaked chimneys thrust up from blackened stone farm house walls; here a few charred rafters
remained above a stone barn, there barn and farm house had collapsed from the heat. The hill where
she sat Mist’s saddle had been sheep pasture; near the fence at the foot of the hill, flies still buzzed
over the refuse of butchering. Not an animal remained in any pasture, not a chicken scratching in a
barnyard. The crop fields were burned stubble.
Couladin and the Shaido were Aiel. But so were Aviendha, and Bair and Amys and Melaine,
and Rhuarc, who said she reminded him of one of his daughters. They had been disgusted at the
impalements, yet even they seemed to think it little more than the treekillers deserved. Perhaps the
only way to truly know the Aiel was to be born Aiel.
Casting a last glance at the destroyed town, she rode slowly down to the rough stone fence and
let herself out at the gate, leaning down to refasten the rawhide thong out of habit. The irony was that

Moiraine had said that Selean might actually go over to Couladin. In the shifting currents ofDaes
Dae’mar, in balancing an Aiel invader against a man who had sent Tairens into Cairhien, for
whatever reason, the decision could have tipped either way, had Couladin given them a chance to
choose.
She rode along the broad road until she caught up with Rand, in his red coat today, and joined
Aviendha and Amys and thirty or more Wise Ones she barely knew besides the other two
dreamwalkers, all following at a short distance. Mat, with his hat and his black-hafted spear, and
Jasin Natael, leather-cased harp slung on his back and crimson banner rippling in the breeze, were
riding, but hurrying Aiel passed the party by on both sides, because Rand led his dapple stallion,
talking with the clan chiefs. Skirts or no skirts, the Wise Ones would have made a good job of
keeping up with the passing columns if they were not sticking to Rand like pine sap. They barely
glanced at Egwene, their eyes and ears focused on him and the seven chiefs.
“. . . and whoever comes through after Timolan,” Rand was saying in a firm voice, “has to be
told the same thing.” Stone Dogs left to watch at Taien had returned to report the Miagoma entering
the pass a day behind. “I’ve come to stop Couladin despoiling this land, not to loot it.”
“A hard message,” Bael said, “for us as well, if you mean we cannot take the fifth.” Han and the
rest, even Rhuarc, nodded.
“The fifth, I give you.” Rand did not raise his voice, yet suddenly his words were driven nails.
“But no part of that is to be food. We will live on what can be found wild or hunted or bought—if
there is anyone with food to sell—until I can have the Tairens increase what they’re bringing up from
Tear. If any man takes a penny more than the fifth, or a loaf of bread without payment, if he burns so
much as a hut because it belongs to a treekiller, or kills a man who is not trying to kill him, that man
will I hang, whoever he is.”
“Dark to tell the clans this,” Dhearic said, almost as stony. “I came to follow He Who Comes
With the Dawn, not to coddle oathbreakers.” Bael and Jheran opened their mouths as if to agree, but
each saw the other and snapped his teeth shut again.
“Mark what I said, Dhearic,” Rand said. “I came to save this land, not ruin it further. What I say
stands for every clan, including the Miagoma and any more who follow. Every clan. You mark me
well.” This time no one spoke, and he swung back into Jeade’en’s saddle, letting the stallion walk on
among the chiefs. Those Aiel faces showed no expression.
Egwene drew breath. Those men were all old enough to be his father and more, leaders of their
people as surely as kings for all they disclaimed it, hardened leaders in battle. It seemed only
yesterday that he had been a boy in more than age, a youth who asked and hoped rather than
commanded and expected to be obeyed. He was changing faster than she could keep up with now. A
good thing, if he kept these men from doing to other cities what Couladin had done to Taien and
Selean. She told herself that. She only wished he could do it without showing more arrogance every
day. How soon before he expected her to obey him as Moiraine did? Or all Aes Sedai? She hoped it
was only arrogance.
Wanting to talk, she kicked a foot free of its stirrup and held a hand down for Aviendha, but the
Aiel woman shook her head. She really did not like to ride. And maybe all those Wise Ones striding
in a pack made her reluctant, too. Some of them would not have ridden had both their legs been
broken. With a sigh, Egwene climbed down, leading Mist by the reins, settling her skirts a little
grumpily. The soft, knee-high Aiel boots she wore looked comfortable and were, but not for walking
very far on that hard, uneven pavement.
“He truly is in command,” she said.

Aviendha barely shifted her eyes from Rand’s back. “I do not know him. I cannot know him.
Look at the thing he carries.”
She meant the sword, of course. Rand did not precisely carry it; it hung at the pommel of his
saddle, in a plain scabbard of brown boarhide, the long hilt covered in the same leather, rising as
high as his waist. He had had hilt and scabbard made by a man from Taien, on the journey through the
pass. Egwene wondered why, when he could channel a sword of fire, and do other things that made
swords seem toys. “You did give it to him, Aviendha.”
Her friend scowled. “He tries to make me accept the hilt, too. He used it; it is his. Used it in
front of me, as if to mock me with a sword in his hand.”
“You are not angry about the sword.” She did not think Aviendha was; she had not said a word
about it, that night in Rand’s tent. “You are still upset over how he spoke to you, and I do understand.
I know he is sorry. He sometimes speaks without thinking, but if you would only let him apologize—”
“I do not want his apologies,” Aviendha muttered. “I do not want . . . I can bear this no more. I
cannot sleep in his tent any longer.” Suddenly she took Egwene’s arm, and if Egwene had not known
better, she would have thought her on the brink of tears. “You must speak to them for me. To Amys
and Bair and Melaine. They will listen to you. You are Aes Sedai. They must let me return to their
tents. They must!”
“Who must do what?” Sorilea said, dropping back from the others to walk alongside them. The
Wise One of Shende Hold had thin white hair and a face like leather drawn tight over her skull. And
clear green eyes that could knock a horse down at ten paces. That was the way she normally looked at
anyone. When Sorilea was angry, other Wise Ones sat quietly and clan chiefs made excuses to leave.
Melaine and another Wise One, a graying Black Water Nakai, started to join them, too, until
Sorilea turned those eyes on them. “If you were not so busy thinking of that new husband, Melaine,
you would know Amys wants to talk with you. You, also, Aeron.” Melaine flushed bright red, and
scurried back to the others, but the older woman got there first. Sorilea watched them go, then put her
full attention on Aviendha. “Now we can have a quiet talk. So you do not want to do something.
Something you were told to do, of course. And you think this child Aes Sedai can get you out of doing
it.”
“Sorilea, I—” Aviendha got no further.
“In my day, girls jumped when a Wise One said jump, and continued jumping until they were
told to stop. As I am still alive, it is still my day. Need I make myself clearer?”
Aviendha took a deep breath. “No, Sorilea,” she said meekly.
The old woman’s eyes came to rest on Egwene. “And you? Do you think you are going to beg her
off?”
“No, Sorilea.” Egwene felt as though she should curtsy.
“Good,” Sorilea said, not sounding satisfied, just as if it was what she had expected. It almost
certainly was. “Now I can speak to you of what I really want to know. I hear the Car’a’carn has
given you an interest gift like no other ever heard of, rubies and moonstones.”
Aviendha jumped as if a mouse had run up her leg. Well, she probably would not, but it was the
way Egwene would have jumped in that circumstance. The Aiel explained about Laman’s sword and
the scabbard so hastily that her words tripped over one another.
Sorilea shifted her shawl, muttering about girls touching swords, even wrapped in blankets, and
about having a sharp word with “young Bair.” “So he has not captured your eye. A pity. It would bind
him to us; he sees too many people as his, now.” For a moment she eyed Aviendha up and down. “I
will have Feran look at you. His greatfather is my sister-son. You have other duties to the people than

learning to be a Wise One. Those hips were made for babes.”
Aviendha stumbled over an upraised paving stone and just caught herself short of falling. “I . . . I
will think on him, when there is time,” she said breathlessly. “I have much to learn yet, of being a
Wise One; and Feran is Seia Doon, and the Black Eyes have vowed not to sleep beneath roof or tent
until Couladin is dead.” Couladin was Seia Doon.
The leathery-faced Wise One nodded as though everything had been settled. “You, young Aes
Sedai. You know the Car’a’carn well, it is said. Will he do as he has threatened? Hang even a clan
chief?”
“I think . . . maybe . . . that he will.” More quickly, Egwene added, “But I am sure he can be
brought to see reason.” She was not sure of any such thing, or even that it was reason—what he had
said sounded only just—but justice would do him no good if he found the others turning against him as
well as the Shaido.
Sorilea glanced at her in surprise, then turned a gaze on the chiefs around Rand’s horse that
should have knocked the lot of them flat. “You mistake me. He must show that mangy pack of wolves
that he is the chief wolf. A chief must be harder than other men, young Aes Sedai, and the Car’a’carn
harder than other chiefs. Every day a few more men, and even Maidens, are taken by the bleakness,
but they are the soft outer bark of the ironwood. What remains is the hard inner core, and he must be
hard to lead them.” Egwene noticed that she did not include herself or the other Wise Ones among
those who would be led. Muttering to herself about “mangy wolves,” Sorilea strode ahead, and soon
had all the Wise Ones listening as they walked. Whatever she was saying, it did not carry.
“Who is this Feran?” Egwene asked. “I’ve never heard you speak of him. What does he look
like?”
Frowning at Sorilea’s back, more than half hidden by the women clustered around her, Aviendha
spoke absently. “He looks much like Rhuarc, only younger, taller and more handsome, with much
redder hair. For over a year he has been trying to attract Enaila’s interest, but I think she will teach
him to sing before she gives up the spear.”
“I don’t understand. Do you mean to share him with Enaila?” It still felt odd, speaking so
casually of that.
Aviendha stumbled again, and stared at her. “Share him? I want no part of him. His face is
beautiful, but he laughs like a braying mule and picks at his ears.”
“But from the way you talked to Sorilea, I thought you . . . liked him. Why didn’t you tell her
what you just told me?”
The other woman’s low laugh sounded pained. “Egwene, if she thought I was trying to balk in
this, she would make the bridal wreath herself and drag both Feran and me by the neck to be wed.
Have you ever seen anyone say ‘no’ to Sorilea? Could you?”
Egwene opened her mouth to say that of course she could, and promptly closed it again. Making
Nynaeve step back was one thing, and trying the same with Sorilea quite another. It would be like
standing in the path of a landslide and telling it to stop.
To change the subject, she said, “I will speak to Amys and the others for you.” Not that she
really thought it would do much good now. The right time had been before it began. At least Aviendha
saw the impropriety of the situation finally. Perhaps . . . “If we go to them together, I am sure they
will listen.”
“No, Egwene. I must obey the Wise Ones. Ji’e’toh requires it.” Just as if she had not been asking
for intercession a moment earlier. Just as if she had not all but begged the Wise Ones not to make her
sleep in Rand’s tent. “But why is my duty to the people never what I wish? Why must it be what I

would rather die before doing?”
“Aviendha, no one is going to make you marry, or have babies. Not even Sorilea.” Egwene
wished she had sounded a bit less limp on that last.
“You do not understand,” the other woman said softly, “and I cannot explain it to you.” She
gathered her shawl around her and would not speak of it further. She was willing to discuss their
lessons, or whether Couladin would turn and give battle, or how marriage had affected Melaine—
who seemed to have to work at being prickly now—or anything at all except what it was that she
could not, or would not, explain.

A Message Sent

The land changed as the sun began to sink. The hills grew lower, the thickets larger. Often the
toppled stone fences of what had been fields had become mounds sprouting wild hedges, or ran
through long stands of oak and leatherleaf and hickory, pine and paperbark and trees Egwene did not
know. The few farm houses had no roofs, and trees ten or fifteen paces high grew in them here, little
woods enclosed inside the stone walls; complete with twittering birds and black-tailed squirrels. The
occasional rivulet caused as much talk among the Aiel as the small forests did, and the grass. They
had heard tales of the wetlands, read of them in books bought from merchants and peddlers like
Hadnan Kadere, but few had actually seen them since the hunt for Laman. They adapted quickly,
though; the gray-brown of the tents blended well with dead leaves under the trees and with the dying
grass and weeds. The camp spread over miles, marked by thousands of small cookfires in the golden
dusk.
Egwene was more than happy to crawl into her tent once the gai’shain had it up. Inside the
lamps were lit and a small fire burned in the firepit. Unlacing her soft boots, she tugged them off and
her woolen stockings as well, and sprawled on the bright layered rugs, wriggling her toes. She
wished she had a basin of water to soak her feet. She could not pretend to be as hardy as the Aiel, but
she was growing soft if a few hours of walking made her feet feel twice their size. Of course, water
would be no problem here. Or it should not be—she remembered that shrunken stream—but surely
she could even have a proper bath again.
Cowinde, meek and silent in her white robes, brought her supper, some of that pale flat bread
made from zemai flour and in a red-striped bowl, a thick stew that she ate mechanically, though she
felt more tired than hungry. She recognized the dried peppers and beans, but did not ask what the dark
meat was. Rabbit, she told herself firmly, and hoped that it was. The Aiel ate things that would put
more curl in her hair than Elayne had. She was willing to bet that Rand could not even look at what he
was eating. Men were always picky eaters.
Once done with the stew, she stretched out near an ornately worked silver lamp that had a
polished silver disc to reflect and increase its light. She had felt a little guilty once she realized that
most of the Aiel had no light at night but their fires; few had brought lamps or oil except the Wise
Ones and the chiefs of clans and septs. But there was no point to sitting in the dim illumination of the
firepit when she could have proper light. That reminded her: the nights here would not be so drastic a
contrast with the days as in the Waste; the tent was already beginning to feel uncomfortably warm.
She channeled briefly, flows of Air to smother the fire, and dug into her saddlebags for the worn
leather-bound book that she had borrowed from Aviendha. It was a small fat volume with crowded
lines of small print, hard to read except in good light, but easily portable. The Flame, the Blade and

the Heart, it was called, a collection of tales about Birgitte and Gaidal Cain, Anselan and
Barashelle, Rogosh Eagle-eye and Dunsinin, and a dozen more. Aviendha claimed that she liked it for
the adventures and battles, and maybe she did, but every last story told of the love of a man and a
woman, too. Egwene was willing to admit that that was what she liked, the sometimes stormy,
sometimes tender threads of undying love. To herself she would admit it, anyway. It was hardly the
sort of enjoyment a woman with any pretensions to sense at all could confess publicly.
In truth she did not feel like reading any more than she had felt like eating—all she really wanted
to do was bathe and sleep, and she might be willing to forgo bathing—but tonight she and Amys were
to meet Nynaeve in Tel’aran’rhiod. It would not be night yet wherever Nynaeve was, on her way to
Ghealdan, and that meant remaining awake.
Elayne had made the menagerie sound quite exciting at their last meeting, though Egwene hardly
thought that Galad’s presence was reason enough to go haring off like that. Nynaeve and Elayne had
simply grown to like adventure, in her opinion. It was too bad about Siuan; they needed a firm hand to
settle them down. Odd that she should think of Nynaeve so; Nynaeve had always been the one with the
firm hand. But since that episode in the Tower of Tel’aran’rhiod, Nynaeve had become less and less
someone she had to struggle against.
Guiltily, she realized as she turned a page that she was looking forward to seeing Nynaeve
tonight. Not because Nynaeve was a friend, but because she wanted to see if the effects had lingered.
If Nynaeve tugged at her braid, she would arch a cool eyebrow at her, and . . . Light, I hope it’s held.
If she lets out about that jaunt, Amys and Bair and Melaine will take turns skinning me, if they
don’t just tell me to go.
Her eyes kept trying to drift shut as she read, fuzzily half-dreaming the stories in the book. She
could be as strong as any of these women, as strong and brave as Dunsinin or Nerein or Melisinde or
even Birgitte, as strong as Aviendha. Would Nynaeve have sense enough to hold her tongue in front of
Amys tonight? She had a vague thought of taking Nynaeve by the scruff of the neck and shaking her.
Silly. Nynaeve was years the older. Arch an eyebrow at her. Dunsinin. Birgitte. As hardy and strong
as a Maiden of the Spear.
Her head slipped down to the pages, and she tried to cradle the small book under her cheek as
her breathing slowed and deepened.
She gave a start at finding herself among the great redstone columns of the Heart of the Stone, in
the strange light of Tel’aran’rhiod, and another at realizing that she wore the cadin’sor. Amys would
not be pleased to see her in that; not amused at all. Hastily she changed it, and was surprised when
her clothes flickered back and forth between the algode blouse and bulky wool skirt and a fine gown
of brocaded blue silk before finally settling on the Aiel garb, complete with her ivory bracelet of
flames and her gold-and-ivory necklace. That indecision had not happened to her in some time.
For a moment she thought of stepping out of the World of Dreams, but she suspected she was
soundly asleep, back in her tent. Very likely she would only step into a dream of her own, and she did
not yet always have awareness in her dreams; without that, she could not return to Tel’aran’rhiod.
She was not about to leave Amys and Nynaeve alone together. Who knew what Nynaeve would say, if
Amys got her temper up? When the Wise One arrived, she would simply say that she had just arrived
herself. The Wise Ones had always been a bit ahead of her, or arrived at the same time, before this,
but surely if Amys believed she had only been there a second it would not matter.
She had almost grown accustomed to the feel of unseen eyes in this vast chamber. Only the
columns, and the shadows, and all this empty space. Still, she hoped that Amys was not too long in

coming, nor Nynaeve. But they would be. Time could be as strange in Tel’aran’rhiod as in any
dream, but it had to be a good hour yet before the arranged meeting. Perhaps she had time to . . .
Suddenly she realized that she could hear voices, like faint whispers among the columns.
Embracing saidar, she moved cautiously toward the sound, toward the place where Rand had left
Callandor beneath the great dome. The Wise Ones claimed that control of Tel’aran’rhiod was as
strong as the One Power here, but she knew her abilities with the Power far better, and trusted them
more. Still hidden well back among the thick redstone columns, she stopped and stared.
It was not a pair of Black sisters, as she had feared, and not Nynaeve, either. Instead, Elayne
stood near the glittering shaft of Callandor rising out of the floorstone, deep in quiet conversation
with as oddly dressed a woman as Egwene had ever seen. She wore a short white coat of peculiar cut
and wide yellow trousers gathered in folds at her ankles, above short boots with raised heels. An
intricate braid of golden hair hung down her back, and she held a bow that gleamed like polished
silver. The arrows in the quiver shone, too.
Egwene squeezed her eyes shut. First the difficulty with her dress, and now this. Just because
she had been reading about Birgitte—a silver bow told the name for certain—was no reason to
imagine that she saw her. Birgitte waited—somewhere—for the Horn of Valere to call her and the
other heroes to the Last Battle. But when Egwene opened her eyes again, Elayne and the oddly
dressed woman were still there. She could not quite make out what they were saying, but she believed
her eyes this time. She was on the point of going out to announce herself when a voice spoke, behind
her.
“Did you decide to come early? Alone?”
Egwene whirled to face Amys, her sun-darkened face too youthful for her white hair, and
leathery-cheeked Bair. Both stood with their arms folded beneath their breasts; even the way their
shawls were pulled tight spoke of displeasure.
“I fell asleep,” Egwene said. It was too much before time for her story to work. Even as she
explained hastily about dozing off and why she had not gone back—minus the part about not wanting
Nynaeve and Amys to talk alone—she was surprised to feel a tinge of shame that she had intended to
lie and relief that she had not. Not that the truth would necessarily save her. Amys was not as strict as
Bair—not quite—but she was perfectly capable of setting her to piling up rocks the rest of the night.
Many of the Wise Ones were great believers in useless labor for punishment; you could not tell
yourself you were doing anything other than being punished while you were burying ashes with a
spoon. That was provided they did not simply refuse to teach her any more, of course. The ashes
would be much preferable.
She could not hold back a sigh of relief when Amys nodded and said, “It can happen. But next
time, return and dream your own dreams; I could have heard what Nynaeve has to say, and tell her
what we know. If Melaine was not with Bael and Dorindha tonight, she would be here, as well. You
frightened Bair. She is proud of your progress, and if anything happened to you . . .”
Bair did not look proud. If anything, she scowled even more deeply as Amys paused. “You are
lucky Cowinde found you when she returned to clear away your supper, and was worried when she
could not rouse you to move to your blankets. If I thought you had been here more than a few minutes
alone . . .” The glare sharpened in dire promise for a moment, and then her voice turned grumpy.
“Now I suppose we have to wait for Nynaeve to arrive, just to stop you begging if we send you back.
If we must, we must, but we will use the time to advantage. Concentrate your mind on—”
“It isn’t Nynaeve,” Egwene said hastily. She did not want to know what a lesson would be like
with Bair in this mood. “It is Elayne, and . . .” She trailed off, as she turned. Elayne, in elegant green

silk suitable for a ball, was pacing up and down not far from Callandor. Birgitte was nowhere to be
seen. I did not imagine her.
“She is here already?” Amys said, moving to where she could see, too.
“Another young fool,” Bair muttered. “Girls today have no more brains or discipline than goats.”
She stalked out ahead of Egwene and Amys and planted herself across Callandor’s glittering shape
from Elayne, fists on hips. “You are not my pupil, Elayne of Andor—though you’ve wheedled enough
out of us to keep you from killing yourself here, if you are careful—but if you were, I would welt you
from your toes up and send you back to your mother until you were grown enough to be let out of her
sight. Which I think might take as many more years as you have lived already. I know you have been
coming into the World of Dreams alone, you and Nynaeve. You are both fools to do it.”
Elayne gave a start when they first appeared, but as Bair’s tirade washed over her, she drew
herself up, that chilly tilt to her chin. Her gown became red and took on a finer sheen, and grew
embroidery down the sleeves and across the high bodice, including rearing lions in white and golden
lilies, her own sigil. A thin golden diadem rested in her red-gold curls, a single rearing lion set in
moonstones above her brows. She did not yet have the best control over such things. Then again,
maybe she wore exactly what she intended this time. “I do thank you for your concern,” she said
regally. “Yet it is true that I am not your pupil, Bair of the Haido Shaarad. I am grateful for your
instruction, but I must go my own way on the tasks given me by the Amyrlin Seat.”
“A dead woman,” Bair said coldly. “You claim obedience to a dead woman.” Egwene could all
but feel Bair’s hackles standing erect in anger; if she did not do something, Bair might decide to teach
Elayne a painful lesson. The last thing they needed was that sort of squabble.
“What . . . Why are you here instead of Nynaeve?” She had been going to ask what Elayne was
doing there, but that would have given Bair an opening, and maybe sounded as if she were on the
Wise One’s side. What she wanted to ask was what Elayne had been doing talking to Birgitte. I did
not imagine it. Maybe it had been someone dreaming she was Birgitte. But only those who entered
Tel’aran’rhiod knowingly remained for more than minutes, and Elayne surely would not have been
speaking with one of them. Where did Birgitte and the others wait?
“Nynaeve is nursing a sore head.” The diadem vanished, and Elayne’s gown became simpler,
with only a few golden scrolls around the bodice.
“Is she ill?” Egwene asked anxiously.
“Only with a headache, and a bruise or two.” Elayne giggled and winced at the same time. “Oh,
Egwene, you would not have believed it. All four of the Chavanas had come to have supper with us.
To flirt with Nynaeve, really. They tried flirting with me the first few days, but Thom had a talk with
them, and they stopped. He did not have any right to do that. Not that I wanted them to flirt, you
understand. Anyway, there they were, flirting with Nynaeve—or trying to, because she paid them no
more mind than buzzing flies—when Latelle stalked up and began hitting Nynaeve with a stick,
calling her all sorts of terrible names.”
“Was she hurt?” Egwene was not sure which of them she meant. If Nynaeve’s temper was roused
...
“Not her. The Chavanas tried to pull her off Latelle, and Taeric will likely limp for days, not to
mention Brugh’s swollen lip. Petra had to carry Latelle to her wagon, and I doubt she’ll put her nose
out for some time.” Elayne shook her head. “Luca did not know who to blame—one of his acrobats
lamed and his bear trainer weeping on her bed—so he blamed everybody, and I thought Nynaeve was
going to box his ears as well. At least she did not channel; I thought she was going to once or twice,
until she had Latelle down on the ground.”

Amys and Bair exchanged unreadable glances; this certainly was not how they expected Aes
Sedai to behave.
Egwene felt a little confused herself, but it was mainly over keeping up with all these people she
had only heard of briefly before. Odd people, traveling with lions, dogs and bears. And an
Illuminator. She did not believe this Petra could possibly be as strong as Elayne claimed. But then,
Thom was eating fire as well as juggling, and what Elayne and Juilin were doing sounded as strange,
even if she was using the Power.
If Nynaeve had come close to channeling . . . Elayne must have seen the glow of her embracing
saidar. Whether they had a real reason to be hiding or not, they would not remain hidden long if one
of them channeled and let people see it. The Tower’s eyes-and-ears would certainly hear; that sort of
news traveled quickly, especially if they were not out of Amadicia yet.
“You tell Nynaeve from me that she had best hold her temper, or I’ll have some words to say to
her that she will not like.” Elayne looked startled—Nynaeve had certainly not told her what had
passed between them—and Egwene added, “If she channels, you can be sure Elaida will hear of it as
soon as a pigeon can fly to Tar Valon.” She could not say more; as it was, it brought another exchange
of glances between Amys and Bair. What they really thought of a Tower divided, and an Amyrlin who
as far as they knew had given orders for Aes Sedai to be drugged, they had never let on. They could
make Moiraine look like the village gossip when they wished. “In fact, I wish I had both of you alone.
If we were in the Tower, in our old rooms, I’d say a few words to the pair of you.”
Elayne stiffened, as queenly and cool as she had been with Bair. “You may say them to me
whenever you wish.”
Had she understood? Alone; away from the Wise Ones. In the Tower. Egwene could only hope.
Best to change the subject and hope the Wise Ones were not picking over her words as carefully as
she hoped that Elayne was. “Will this fight with Latelle cause problems?” What had Nynaeve been
thinking of? Back home, she would have had any woman her age who did the same up before the
Women’s Circle so fast that her eyes would pop. “You must be almost to Ghealdan by now.”
“Three more days, Luca says, if we are lucky. The menagerie does not move very fast.”
“Perhaps you should leave them now.”
“Perhaps,” Elayne said slowly. “I really would like to highwalk just once in front of . . .” With a
shake of her head, she glanced at Callandor; the neckline of her gown dipped precipitously, then rose
again. “I do not know, Egwene. We could not travel much faster alone than we are traveling, and we
don’t know where to go exactly, yet.” That meant Nynaeve had not remembered where the Blues were
gathering. If Elaida’s report had been right. “Not to mention that Nynaeve might burst if we had to
abandon the wagon and buy saddle horses, or another coach. Besides, we are both learning a great
deal about the Seanchan. Cerandin served as a s’redit handler at the Court of the Nine Moons, where
the Seanchan Empress sits. Yesterday she showed us things that she took when she fled Falme.
Egwene, she had an a’dam.”
Egwene stepped forward, her skirts brushing Callandor. Rand’s traps were not physical,
whatever Nynaeve seemed to think. “Can you be sure she was not a sul’dam?” Her voice trembled
with anger.
“I am certain,” Elayne said soothingly. “I put the a’dam on her myself, and it had no effect.”
That was a little secret that the Seanchan themselves did not know, or hid well if they did. Their
damane were women born with the spark, women who would channel eventually even if untaught.
But the sul’dam, who controlled the damane—they were the women who needed to be taught. The
Seanchan thought that women who could channel were dangerous animals who had to be controlled,

and yet unknowingly gave many of them honored positions.
“I do not understand this interest in the Seanchan.” Amys said the name awkwardly; she had
never heard it until Elayne spoke it at their last meeting. “What they do is terrible, but they are gone.
Rand al’Thor defeated them, and they fled.”
Egwene turned her back and stared at the huge polished columns running off into shadow. “Gone
is not to say they will never come back.” She did not want them to see her face, not even Elayne. “We
must know whatever we can learn, in case they ever return.” They had put an a’dam on her in Falme.
They had meant to send her over the Aryth Ocean to Seanchan, to spend the rest of her life as a dog on
a leash. Fury welled up in her every time she thought of them. And fear, too. The fear that if they did
return, they would succeed in taking and holding her this time. That was what she could not allow
them to see. The stark terror that she knew was in her eyes.
Elayne put a hand on her arm. “We will be ready for them if they do come back,” she said gently.
“They will not find us in surprise and ignorance again.” Egwene patted her hand, though she wanted
to clutch it; Elayne understood more than Egwene wished, yet it was comforting that she did.
“Let us finish what we are here for,” Bair said briskly. “You need to be asleep in truth,
Egwene.”
“We had the gai’shain undress you, and put you in your blankets.” Surprisingly, Amys sounded
as gentle as Elayne. “When you return to your body, you can sleep until morning.”
Egwene’s cheeks colored. Given Aiel ways, it was as likely as not that some of those gai’shain
had been men. She would have to speak to them about that—delicately, of course; they would not
understand, and it was not a thing she could be comfortable explaining.
The fear was gone, she realized. Apparently I’m more afraid of being embarrassed than I am
of the Seanchan. It was not true, but she held to the thought.
There was really little to tell Elayne. That they were in Cairhien finally, that Couladin had
devastated Selean and ravaged the surrounding land, that the Shaido were still days ahead and moving
west. The Wise Ones knew more than she; they had not taken to their tents straightaway. There had
been skirmishes in the evening, small ones and only a few, with mounted men who quickly fled, and
other men on horses who had been sighted ran without fighting. There had been no prisoners taken.
Moiraine and Lan seemed to think that the riders could have been bandits, or supporters of one or
another of the Houses trying to claim the Sun Throne. All had been equally ragged. Whoever they
were, word would soon spread that there were more Aiel in Cairhien.
“They had to learn sooner or later” was Elayne’s only comment.
Egwene watched Elayne as she and the Wise Ones faded away—to her it seemed as though
Elayne and the Heart of the Stone became more and more attenuated—but her golden-haired friend
gave no sign as to whether she had understood the message.

CHAPTER

Dreams of Galad

Instead of returning to her own body, Egwene floated in darkness. She seemed to be darkness
herself, without substance. Whether her body lay up or down or sideways from her, she did not know
—there was no direction here—but she knew that it was near, that she could step into it easily. All
around her in the blackness, fireflies seemingly twinkled, a vast horde fading away into unimaginable
distance. Those were dreams, dreams of the Aiel in the camp, dreams of men and women across
Cairhien, across the world, all glittering there.
She could pick out some among the nearer and name the dreamer, now. In one way those
sparkles were just as alike as fireflies—that was what had given her so much trouble in the beginning
—but in another, somehow, they now seemed as individual as faces. Rand’s dreams, and Moiraine’s,
appeared muted, dimmed by the wards they had woven. Amys’ and Bair’s were bright and regular in
their pulsing; they had taken their own advice, apparently. Had she not seen those, she would have
been into her body in an instant. Those two could rove this darkness much more ably than she; she
would not have known they were there until they pounced on her. If she ever learned to recognize
Elayne and Nynaeve in the same way, she would be able to find them in that great constellation
wherever they were in the world. But tonight she did not mean to observe anyone’s dream.
Carefully she formed a well-remembered image in her mind, and she was back in
Tel’aran’rhiod, inside the small, windowless room in the Tower where she had lived as a novice. A
narrow bed was built against one white-painted wall. A washstand and a three-legged stool stood
opposite the door, and the current occupant’s dresses and shifts of white wool hung with a white
cloak on pegs. There could as easily have been none; the Tower had not been able to fill the novices’
quarters in many years. The floor was almost as pale as walls and clothes. Every day the novice who
lived there would scrub that floor on hands and knees; Egwene had done so herself, and Elayne, in the
next room. If a queen came to train in the Tower, she would start in a room like this, scrubbing the
floor.
The garments were arranged differently when she glanced at them again, but she ignored that.
Ready to embrace saidar in a heartbeat, she opened the door just enough to stick her head out. And
drew a relieved breath when she found Elayne’s head coming just as slowly out of the next doorway.
Egwene hoped she did not appear as wide-eyed and uncertain. She motioned hurriedly, and Elayne
scurried across in novice white that became a pale gray silk riding dress as she darted inside.
Egwene hated gray dresses; that was what damane wore.
For an instant more she stayed there, scanning the railed galleries of the novices’ quarters. Layer
on layer they rose, and fell as many levels to the Novices’ Court below. Not that she really expected
Liandrin or worse to be out there, but it never hurt to be careful.

“I thought this was what you meant,” Elayne said as she shut the door. “Do you have any idea
how difficult it is to remember what I can say in front of whom? Sometimes I wish we could just tell
the Wise Ones everything. Let them know we are only Accepted, and be done with it.”
“You would be done with it,” Egwene said firmly. “I happen to be sleeping not twenty paces
from them.”
Elayne shivered. “That Bair. She reminds me of Lini when I’d broken something I was not
supposed to touch.”
“You wait until I introduce you to Sorilea.” Elayne gave her a doubtful look, but then, Egwene
was not sure that she would have believed Sorilea herself until she met her. There was no way to do
this easily. She shifted her shawl. “Tell me about meeting Birgitte. It was Birgitte, wasn’t it?”
Elayne staggered as if hit in the stomach. Her blue eyes closed for a moment, and she took a
breath that must have filled her to the toes. “I cannot talk to you about that.”
“What do you mean you can’t talk? You have a tongue. Was it Birgitte?”
“I cannot, Egwene. You must believe me. I would if I could, but I cannot. Perhaps . . . I can ask
. . .” If Elayne had been the kind of woman to wring her hands, she would have been doing it then. Her
mouth opened and closed without any words coming out; her eyes darted around the room as if
seeking inspiration or aid. Taking a deep breath, she fixed an urgent blue gaze on Egwene. “Anything
I say violates confidences I promised to hold. Even that. Please, Egwene. You must trust me. And you
must not tell anyone what you . . . think you saw.”
Egwene forced the stern frown from her face. “I will trust you.” At least she knew now for a fact
that she had not been seeing things. Birgitte? Light! “I hope that one day you will trust me enough to
tell me.”
“I do trust you, but . . .” Shaking her head, Elayne sat down on the edge of the neatly made bed.
“We keep secrets too often, Egwene, but sometimes there is a reason.”
After a moment Egwene nodded and sat next to her. “When you can,” was all she said, but her
friend gave her a relieved hug.
“I told myself I was not going to ask this, Egwene. Just once I was not going to have my head full
of him.” The gray riding dress became a shimmering green gown; Elayne could not possibly have
been aware of how deeply the neckline swooped. “But . . . is Rand well?”
“He is alive and unharmed, if that is what you mean. I thought he was hard in Tear, but today I
heard him threaten to hang men if they go against his commands. Not that they are bad orders—he
won’t let anyone take food without paying, or murder people—but still. They were the first to hail
him as He Who Comes With the Dawn; they followed him out of the Waste without hesitation. And he
threatened them, as hard as cold steel.”
“Not a threat, Egwene. He is a king, whatever you or he or anyone else says, and a king or queen
must dispense justice without fear of enemies or favor for friends. Anyone who does that has to be
hard. Mother can make the city walls seem soft, sometimes.”
“He doesn’t have to be so arrogant about it,” Egwene said levelly. “Nynaeve said I should
remind him he’s only a man, but I’ve not figured out how yet.”
“He does have to remember he is only a man. But he has a right to expect to be obeyed.” There
was something of a haughty tone to Elayne’s voice, until she glanced down at herself. Then her face
went crimson, and the green gown suddenly had a lace neck under her chin. “Are you sure you are not
mistaking that for arrogance?” she finished in a strangled voice.
“He’s as overweening as a pig in a pea field.” Egwene shifted herself on the bed; she
remembered it as hard, but the thin mattress felt softer than what she slept on in the tent. She did not

want to talk about Rand. “Are you certain this fight will not cause more trouble?” A feud with this
Latelle could not make their traveling easier.
“I do not think so. Latelle’s grievance against Nynaeve was that all the unattached men were no
longer hers to pick and choose from. Some women do think that way, I suppose. Aludra keeps to
herself, and Cerandin wouldn’t have said boo to a goose until I started teaching her to stand up for
herself, and Clarine is married to Petra. But Nynaeve has made it clear that she’ll box the ears of any
man who even thinks he can flirt with her, and she apologized to Latelle, so I hope that may settle it.”
“She apologized?”
The other woman nodded, her face as bemused as Egwene knew her own must be. “I thought she
would thump Luca when he told her she must—he doesn’t seem to think her injunction holds to him,
by the way—but she did it, after grumping about for an hour. Muttering about you, actually.” She
hesitated, giving Egwene a sidelong look. “Did you say something to her at your last meeting? She has
been . . . different . . . since then, and sometimes she talks to herself. Argues, really. About you, from
the little I’ve heard.”
“I said nothing that did not have to be said.” So it was holding, whatever it was that had
happened between them. Either that, or Nynaeve was storing up her anger for the next time they met.
She was not going to put up with the woman’s temper anymore, not now that she knew she did not
have to. “You tell her from me that she is too old to be rolling about on the ground fighting. If she gets
into another, I’ll have worse to say to her. You tell her that exactly. It will be worse.” Let Nynaeve
chew on that until next time. Either she would be mild as a lamb . . . Or else Egwene would just have
to carry through on her threat. Nynaeve might be stronger in the Power, when she could channel, but
here, Egwene was. One way or another, she was finished with Nynaeve’s tantrums.
“I will tell her,” Elayne said. “You have changed, too. There seems to be something of Rand’s
attitude about you.”
It took Egwene a moment to realize what she meant, helped by that amused little smile. “Don’t
be silly.”
Elayne laughed aloud and gave her another hug. “Oh, Egwene, you will be Amyrlin Seat one
day, when I am Queen of Andor.”
“If there is a Tower then,” Egwene said soberly, and Elayne’s laughter faded.
“Elaida cannot destroy the White Tower, Egwene. Whatever she does, the Tower will remain.
Perhaps she will not stay Amyrlin. Once Nynaeve remembers the name of that town, I will wager that
we find a Tower in exile, with every Ajah but the Red.”
“I hope so.” Egwene knew she sounded sad. She wanted Aes Sedai to support Rand and oppose
Elaida, but that meant the White Tower broken for sure, maybe never to be made whole again.
“I must get back,” Elayne said. “Nynaeve insists that whichever of us does not enter
Tel’aran’rhiod remain awake, and with her headache, she needs to drink one of her herb teas and
sleep. I do not know why she is so insistent. Whoever is watching can do nothing to help, and we both
know enough to be perfectly safe here, now.” Her green dress flickered to Birgitte’s white coat and
voluminous yellow trousers for an instant, then snapped back. “She said I wasn’t to tell you this, but
she thinks that Moghedien is trying to find us. Her and me.”
Egwene did not ask the obvious question. Clearly it was something that Birgitte had told them.
Why did Elayne persist in trying to keep that secret? Because she promised to. Elayne never broke a
promise in her life. “You tell her to be careful.” Small chance that Nynaeve was sitting and waiting,
if she thought one of the Forsaken was after her. She would be remembering that she had defeated the
woman once, and she had always had more courage than sense. “The Forsaken are nothing to take

lightly. And neither are Seanchan, even if they are supposedly just animal trainers. You tell her that.”
“I do not suppose you would listen if I told you to be careful, too.”
She gave Elayne a startled look. “I am always careful. You know that.”
“Of course.” The last thing Egwene saw as the other woman faded away was a very amused
smile.
Egwene herself did not go. If Nynaeve could not remember where that gathering of Blues was,
perhaps she could discover it here. It was hardly a new idea: this was not her first trip to the Tower
since her last meeting with Nynaeve. She put on a copy of Enaila’s face, with flame-colored hair to
her shoulders, and an Accepted’s dress with its banded hem, then formed the image of Elaida’s
ornately furnished study.
It was as it had been before, though on every visit fewer of the vine-carved stools stood in that
arc in front of the wide writing table. The paintings still hung above the fireplace. Egwene strode
straight to the table, pushing aside that thronelike chair with its inlaid ivory Flame of Tar Valon, so
she could reach the lacquered letterbox. Lifting the lid, all fighting hawks and clouds, she began
scanning parchments as fast as she could. Even so, some melted away half-read, or changed. There
was no way to tell what was important and what insignificant beforehand.
Most seemed reports of failure. Still no word of where the Lord of Bashere had taken his army,
and a note of frustration and worry tinging the words. That name tickled the back of her mind, but with
no time to waste she pushed it firmly away and snatched up another sheet. No word on Rand’s
whereabouts, either, said a cringing report filled with near panic. That was good to know, and worth
the trip by itself. More than a month had passed since the last news from Tanchico by any Ajah’s
eyes-and-ears, and others in Tarabon had also gone silent; the writer blamed the anarchy there;
rumors that someone had taken Tanchico could not be confirmed, but the writer suggested that Rand
himself was involved. Even better, if Elaida was looking in the wrong place by a thousand leagues. A
confused report said that a Red sister in Caemlyn claimed to have seen Morgase at a public audience,
but various Ajahs’ agents in Caemlyn said the Queen had been in seclusion for days. Fighting in the
Borderlands, possibly minor rebellions in Shienar and Arafel; the parchment was gone before she
reached the reason. Pedron Niall calling in Whitecloaks to Amadicia, possibly to move against
Altara. A good thing that Elayne and Nynaeve had only another three days there.
The next parchment was about Elayne and Nynaeve. First the writer advised against punishing
the agent who had allowed them to escape—Elaida had scratched that out in bold strokes and written
“Make an example!” in the margin—and then, just when the woman began to detail the search for the
pair in Amadicia, the single sheet became a fistful, a sheaf of what seemed to be builders’ and
masons’ estimates for constructing a private residence for the Amyrlin Seat on the Tower grounds.
More like a palace, by the number of pages.
She let the pages fall, and they vanished before they finished scattering across the tabletop. The
lacquered box was closed again. She could spend the rest of her life here, she knew; there would
always be more documents in the box, and they would always be changing. The more ephemeral
something was in the waking world—a letter, a piece of clothing, a bowl that might be frequently
moved—the less firm its reflection in Tel’aran’rhiod. She could not remain here too long; sleep
while in the World of Dreams was not as restful as sleep undisturbed.
Hurrying out to the antechamber, she was about to reach for the neat piles of scrolls and
parchments, some with seals, on the Keeper’s writing table, when the room seemed to flicker. Before
she had time to even consider what that meant, the door opened, and Galad stepped in, smiling, his
brocaded blue coat fitting his shoulders perfectly, snug breeches showing the shape of his calves.

She took a deep breath, her stomach fluttering. It just was not fair for a man to have a face so
beautiful.
He stepped closer, dark eyes twinkling, and brushed her cheek with his fingers. “Will you walk
with me in the Water Garden?” he said softly.
“If you two wish to canoodle,” a brisk woman’s voice said, “you will not do so here.”
Egwene spun, wide-eyed, staring at Leane seated behind the table with the Keeper’s stole on her
shoulders and a fond smile on her copper-cheeked face. The door to the Amyrlin’s study was open,
and inside Siuan stood beside her simple, well-polished writing table, reading a long parchment, the
striped stole of office on her shoulders. This was madness.
She fled without thinking of what image she was forming, and found herself gulping for breath on
the Green in Emond’s Field, with the thatch-roofed houses all around, and the Winespring gushing
from the stone outcrop on the broad expanse of grass. Near the swift, rapidly widening stream stood
her father’s small inn, its lower floor stone, the overhanging upper whitewashed. “The only roof like
it in the Two Rivers,” Bran al’Vere had often said of his red tiles. The large stone foundation near the
Winespring Inn, a huge, spreading oak rising from its center, was far older than the inn, but some said
an inn of some sort had stood there beside the Winespring Water for more than two thousand years.
Fool. After warning Nynaeve so firmly about dreams in Tel’aran’rhiod, she had nearly let
herself be caught in one of her own. Though it was odd that it had been Galad. She did dream of him,
sometimes. Her face heated; she certainly did not love him, or even like him very much, but he was
beautiful, and in those dreams he had been much more what she could have wished him. It was his
brother Gawyn that she dreamed of more often, but that was just as silly. Whatever Elayne said, he
had never made any feelings known to her.
It was that fool book, with all those tales of lovers. As soon as she woke in the morning she was
going to give the thing back to Aviendha. And tell her that she did not think that she read it for the
adventures at all.
She was reluctant to leave, though. Home. Emond’s Field. The last place that she had really felt
safe. More than a year and a half had passed since she last saw it, yet everything seemed as she
remembered. Not quite everything. On the Green stood two tall poles with large banners, one a red
eagle, the other an equally red wolf’s head.
Had Perrin anything to do with those? She could not imagine how. Yet he had come home, so
Rand said, and she had dreamed of him with wolves more than once.
Enough idle standing about. It was time to—
Flicker.
Her mother stepped out of the inn, graying braid pulled over one shoulder. Marin al’Vere was a
slim woman, still handsome, and the best cook in the Two Rivers. Egwene could hear her father
laughing inside the common room, where he was meeting with the rest of the Village Council.
“Are you still out here, child?” her mother said, gently chiding and amused. “You’ve certainly
been married long enough to know you shouldn’t let your husband know you mope about waiting on
him.” With a shake of her head, she laughed. “Too late. Here he comes.”
Egwene turned eagerly, eyes darting past the children playing on the Green. The timbers of the
low Wagon Bridge thrummed as Gawyn galloped across and swung down from his saddle in front of
her. Tall and straight in his gold-embroidered red coat, he had his sister’s red-gold curls, and
marvelous deep blue eyes. He was not so handsome as his half-brother, of course, but her heart beat
faster for him than it had for Galad—For Galad? What?—and she had to press her hands to her
stomach in a vain attempt to still gigantic butterflies.

“Did you miss me?” he said, smiling.
“A little.” Why did I think of Galad? As if I’d just seen him a moment ago. “Now and then,
when there was nothing interesting to occupy my time. Did you miss me?”
For answer, he pulled her off her feet and kissed her. She was not aware of very much else until
he set her back down on unsteady legs. The banners were gone. What banners?
“Here he is,” her mother said, approaching with a babe wrapped in swaddling. “Here’s your
son. He is a fine boy. He never cries at all.”
Gawyn laughed as he took the child, held him aloft. “He does have your eyes, Egwene. He will
be a fine one with the girls one day.”
Egwene backed away from them, shaking her head. There had been banners, red eagle and red
wolf’s head. She had seen Galad. In the Tower. “NOOOOOOO!”
She fled, leaping from Tel’aran’rhiod to her own body. Awareness remained only long enough
for her to wonder how she could possibly have been fool enough to let her own fancies nearly trap
her, and then she was deep in her own safe dream. Gawyn galloped across the Wagon Bridge,
swinging down. . . .
Stepping out from behind a thatch-roofed house, Moghedien wondered idly where this little
village was. Not the sort of place she would expect to see banners flying. The girl had been stronger
than she had thought, to escape her weaving of Tel’aran’rhiod. Even Lanfear could not improve on
her abilities here, whatever she claimed. Still, the girl had just been of interest because she was
speaking to Elayne Trakand, who might lead her to Nynaeve al’Meara. The only reason to trap her
had simply been to rid Tel’aran’rhiod of one who could walk it freely. It was bad enough that she
must share it with Lanfear.
But Nynaeve al’Meara. That woman she meant to make beg to be bound in her service. She
would take her in the flesh, perhaps ask the Great Lord to grant her immortality, so Nynaeve could
have forever to regret opposing Moghedien. She and Elayne were scheming with Birgitte, were they?
That was another she had reason to punish. Birgitte had not even known who Moghedien was, so long
ago, in the Age of Legends, when she foiled Moghedien’s finely wrought plan to lay Lews Therin by
his heels. But Moghedien had known her. Only, Birgitte—Teadra, she had been then—had died
before she could deal with her. Death was no punishment, no end, not when it meant living on here.
Nynaeve al’Meara, Elayne Trakand, and Birgitte. Those three she would find, and deal with.
From the shadows, so that they would not know until too late. All three, without exception.
She vanished, and the banners waved on in the breeze of Tel’aran’rhiod.

CHAPTER
26

Sallie Daera

The halo of greatness, blue and gold, flickered fitfully around Logain’s head, though he rode
slumped in his saddle. Min did not understand why it had appeared more often of late. He no longer
even bothered to lift his eyes from the weeds in front of his black stallion to the low, wooded hills
rolling by all around them.
The other two women rode together a little ahead, Siuan as awkward on shaggy Bela as she had
ever been, Leane guiding her gray mare deftly, with knees more than reins. Only an unnaturally
straight ribbon of ferns, poking through the leaf-covered forest floor, hinted that there had ever been a
road here. The lacy ferns were withering, and the leaf mold rustled and crackled dryly under the
horses’ hooves. Thickly woven branches gave a little shelter from the noonday sun, but it was hardly
cool. Sweat rolled down Min’s face, despite an occasional breeze that stirred from behind them.
Fifteen days now they had ridden west and south from Lugard, guided only by Siuan’s insistence
that she knew exactly where they were heading. Not that she shared her destination, of course; Siuan
and Leane were as close-mouthed as sprung bear traps. Min was not even sure that Leane actually
knew. Fifteen days, while towns and villages grew fewer and farther between, until finally there were
none. Day by day Logain’s shoulders had sagged a little more, and day by day the halo appeared more
often. At first he had only begun muttering that they were chasing Jak o’ the Mists, but Siuan had
regained her leadership without opposition as he turned more and more inward. For the past six days
he had not seemed to have the energy to care where they were going or whether they would ever get
there.
Siuan and Leane talked quietly up ahead, now. All Min could hear was a barely audible murmur
that might as well have been the wind in the leaves. And if she tried to ride closer, they would tell her
to keep an eye on Logain, or simply stare at her until only a stone-blind fool could keep her nose
where it did not belong. They had done both often enough. From time to time, though, Leane twisted in
her saddle to look at Logain.
Finally Leane let Moonflower fall back beside his black stallion. The heat did not seem to be
bothering her; not so much as a sheen of perspiration marred her coppery face. Min reined Wildrose
aside to give her room.
“It won’t be long now,” Leane told him in a sultry voice. He did not look up from the weeds in
front of his horse. She leaned closer, holding his arm for balance. Pressing against it, really. “A little
while longer, Dalyn. You will have your revenge.” His eyes stayed dully on the road.
“A dead man would pay more notice,” Min said, and meant it. She had been taking notes in her
head of everything Leane did, and talking with her of an evening, though trying not to let on why. She
would never be able to behave the way that Leane did—not unless I had enough wine in me that I

couldn’t think at all—yet a few pointers might come in handy. “Maybe if you kissed him?”
Leane shot her a glare that could have frozen a rushing stream, but Min merely looked back. She
had never had the problems with Leane that she did with Siuan—well, not as many, anyway—and the
few difficulties had grown less since the other woman had left the Tower. Much fewer since they had
begun discussing men. How could you be intimidated by a woman who had told you in dead
seriousness that there were one hundred and seven different kisses, and ninety-three ways to touch a
man’s face with your hand? Leane actually seemed to believe these things.
Min had not meant it as a jibe, really, the suggestion of a kiss. Leane had been cooing at him,
giving him smiles that should have made steam rise from his ears, since the day he had had to be
hauled out of his blankets instead of rising first to chivvy the rest of them. Min did not know whether
Leane actually felt something for the man, though she did find it hard to credit even the possibility, or
was just trying to keep him from giving up and dying, to keep him alive for whatever Siuan had
planned.
Leane certainly had not given up flirting with others besides him. She and Siuan had apparently
worked out that Siuan would deal with women, Leane with men, and so it had been ever since
Lugard. Her smiles and glances had twice gotten them rooms where the innkeeper had said there were
none, lowered the bill at those and three more, and on two nights earned barns instead of bushes for
sleeping. They had also gotten the four of them chased off by one farmwife with a pitchfork, and a
breakfast of cold porridge thrown at them by another, but Leane had thought the incidents funny, if no
one else did. The last few days, however, Logain had stopped reacting like every other man who saw
her for more than two minutes. He had stopped reacting to her or anything else.
Siuan pulled Bela back stiffly, elbows out and managing to look on the point of falling off any
moment. The heat was not touching her, either. “Have you viewed him today?” She hardly glanced at
Logain.
“It is still the same,” Min said patiently. Siuan refused to understand or believe, however many
times she told her, and so did Leane. It would not have mattered if she had not seen the aura since her
first viewing of it in Tar Valon. Had Logain been lying in the road, rasping his death rattle, she would
have wagered all she had and more on a miraculous recovery, somehow. The appearance of an Aes
Sedai to Heal him. Something. What she saw was always true. It always happened. She knew the
same way that she had known the first time she saw Rand al’Thor that she would fall desperately,
helplessly in love with him, the same way she had known she would have to share him with two other
women. Logain was destined for glory such as few men had dreamed of.
“Don’t you take that tone with me,” Siuan said, that blue-eyed gaze sharpening. “It is bad enough
we have to spoon-feed this great hairy carp to make him eat, without you going sulky as a fisher-bird
in winter. I may have to put up with him, girl, but if you start giving me trouble, too, you will regret it
in short order. Do I make myself clear?”
“Yes, Mara.” At least you could have put a touch of sarcasm in it, she thought scornfully. You
don’t have to be meek as a goose. You’ve told Leane off to her face. The Domani woman had
suggested that she practice what they had been discussing on a farrier in the last village. A tall,
handsome man, with strong-looking hands and a slow smile, but still . . . “I will try not to be sulky.”
The worst part was that she realized she had tried to sound sincere. Siuan had that effect. Min could
not even begin to imagine Siuan discussing how to smile at a man. Siuan would look a man in the eye,
tell him what to do, and expect to see it done promptly. Just the way she did with everyone else. If she
did anything else, as she had with Logain, it would only be because the point did not matter enough to
press.

“It is not much farther, is it?” Leane said briskly. She saved the other voice for men. “I do not
like the look of him, and if we have to stop for another night . . . Well, if he helps any less than he did
this morning, I don’t know that we will be able to get him into his saddle again.”
“Not much, if those last directions I had are right.” Siuan sounded irritated. She had asked
questions at that last village, two days ago—not letting Min hear, of course; Logain had showed no
interest—and she did not like to be reminded of them. Min could not understand why. Siuan could
hardly expect Elaida to be behind them.
She herself hoped it was not much farther. It was hard to be sure how far south they had drifted
since leaving the highway to Jehannah. Most villagers had only vague notions of where their village
actually was in relation to anything except the nearest towns, but when they crossed the
Manetherendrelle into Altara, just before Siuan took them away from the well-traveled road, the
grizzled old ferryman had been studying a tattered map for some reason, a map that stretched as far as
the Mountains of Mist. Unless her estimate was off, they were going to reach another wide river in not
many miles. Either the Boern, which meant they were already into Ghealdan, where the Prophet and
his mobs were, or else the Eldar, with Amadicia and Whitecloaks on the far side.
She was betting on Ghealdan, Prophet or no Prophet, and even that was a surprise if they really
were close. Only a fool would think to find a gathering of Aes Sedai any nearer to Amadicia than they
had to be, and Siuan was anything but that. Whether they were in Ghealdan or Altara, Amadicia had to
be not many miles distant.
“Gentling would have to catch up to him now,” Siuan muttered. “If he can only hang on a few
more days . . .” Min kept her mouth shut; if the woman would not listen, there was no use in speaking.
Shaking her head, Siuan heeled Bela back into the lead, gripping her reins as though expecting
the stout mare to bolt, and Leane returned to silken-voiced cajoling of Logain. Maybe she did have
feelings for him; it would be no odder a choice than Min’s own.
Forested hills slid on by with never a sign of change, all trees and tangles of weeds and
brambles. The ferns that marked the old road ran on, arrow-straight; Leane had said the soil was
different where the road had been, as if Min should have known that. Squirrels with tufted ears
sometimes chattered at them from a branch, and occasionally birds called. Which birds, Min could
not begin to guess. Baerlon might not be a city when compared to Caemlyn or Ilian or Tear, but she
thought of herself as a city woman; a bird was a bird. And she did not care what kind of dirt a fern
grew in.
Her doubts began to surface again. They had oozed up more than once after Kore Springs, but
back then it had been easier to push them down. Since Lugard they had bubbled to the top more often,
and she found herself considering Siuan in ways she would never have dared, once. Not that she had
the nerve to actually confront Siuan with any of them, of course; it galled her to admit that, even to
herself. But maybe Siuan did not know where she was going. She could lie, since stilling broke her
away from the Three Oaths. Maybe she was still just hoping that if she continued searching she would
find some trace of what she needed desperately to find. In a small way, a peculiar way surely, Leane
had begun making a life for herself apart from concerns of power and the Power and Rand. Not that
she had abandoned them entirely, but Min did not think there was anything else for Siuan. The White
Tower and the Dragon Reborn were the whole of her life, and she would hold to them even if she had
to lie to herself.
Woodland gave way to a large village so quickly that Min stared. Sweet-gum and oak and
scrubby pine—those were trees she could recognize—running to within fifty paces of thatch-roofed
houses made of rounded river stones and clinging to low hills. She was willing to wager that not so

long ago the forest had grown right through. A good many trees actually stood in narrow little thickets
among some of the houses, crowding against the walls, and here and there unweathered stumps stood
close by the front of a house. The streets still had a look of new-turned earth, not the hard-packed
surface that came from generations of feet. Men in their shirtsleeves were up laying new thatch atop
three large stone cubes that had to have been inns—one actually had the remains of a faded,
weathered sign dangling above the door—yet no old thatch lay anywhere that she could see. There
were far too many women out and about for the number of men in sight, and far too few children
playing for the number of women. The smells of midday cooking in the air were the only normal
things about the place.
If the first glimpse startled Min, when she really saw what lay in front of her she nearly fell out
of her saddle. The younger women, shaking blankets from a window or hurrying on some errand,
wore plain woolen dresses, but no village of any size had ever contained so many women in riding
dresses of silk or fine wool, in every color and cut. Around those women, and around most of the
men, auras and images floated before her eyes, changing and flickering; most people rarely had
anything for her viewing, but Aes Sedai and Warders seldom lacked an aura for as much as an hour.
The children must have belonged to Tower servants. Aes Sedai who married were few and far
between, but knowing them, they would have made every effort to bring their servants, with their
families, out of any place they felt that they must flee themselves. Siuan had found her gathering.
There was an eerie stillness as they rode into the village. No one spoke. Aes Sedai stood
without moving, watching them, and so did younger women and girls who must be Accepted or even
novices. Men who a moment before had been moving with wolfish grace were frozen, one hand
hidden in thatch, or reaching into a doorway, doubtless where weapons were hidden. The children
vanished, hurriedly herded away by the adults who had to be servants. Under all those unwinking
stares, the hair on the back of Min’s neck tried to stand up.
Leane appeared uneasy, casting sidelong glances at the people they rode past, but Siuan stayed
smooth-faced and calm as she led the way straight to the largest inn, the one with the unreadable sign,
and scrambled down to tie Bela to the iron ring of one of the stone hitching posts that appeared to
have been only recently set upright. Helping Leane help Logain to the ground—Siuan never offered a
hand in getting him up or down—Min found her eyes darting around. Everyone staring, no one
moving. “I never expected to be greeted like a long-lost daughter,” she murmured to the other woman,
“but why isn’t anyone at least saying hello?”
Before Leane could answer—if she meant to—Siuan said, “Well, don’t stop pulling oar with the
shore in reach. Bring him on in.” She disappeared inside while Min and Leane were still guiding
Logain to the door. He went easily, but when they ceased to urge him he took only one step before
stopping.
The common room looked like none Min had ever seen before. The wide fireplaces were cold,
of course, and had gaps where stones had fallen out; the plaster ceiling looked rotten, with holes in it
as big as her head where the lathing showed. Mismatched tables of every size and shape stood about
on an age-roughened floor that several girls were sweeping. Women with ageless faces sat examining
parchments, giving orders to Warders, a few of whom wore their color-shifting cloaks, or to other
women, some of whom had to be Accepted or novices. Others were too old for that, perhaps half of
them graying and clearly showing their years, and there were men who were not Warders, too, most
either darting off as though carrying messages or else fetching parchments or cups of wine to the Aes
Sedai. The bustle had a satisfying air of something being done. Auras and images danced around the
room, wreathing heads, so many that she had to try to ignore them before they overwhelmed her. It

was not easy, but it was a trick she had had to learn when around more than a handful of Aes Sedai at
once.
Four Aes Sedai glided forward to meet the newcomers, all grace and cool serenity in their
divided skirts. For Min, seeing their familiar features was like reaching home after being lost.
Sheriam’s tilted green eyes fixed immediately on Min’s face. Rays of silver and blue flashed
about her fiery hair, and a soft golden light; Min could not say what it meant. Slightly plump in her
dark blue silk, at the moment she was sternness itself. “I would be happier to see you, child, if I knew
how you discovered our presence here, and if I had some inkling of why you conceived the
crackbrained idea of bringing him.” Half a dozen Warders had drifted near, hands resting on swords,
eyes sharp on Logain; he did not seem to see them at all.
Min gaped. Why were they asking her? “My crackbr—?” She had no chance to say more.
“It would be far better,” pale-cheeked Carlinya cut in icily, “if he had died as the rumors say.” It
was not the ice of anger, but of cold reason. She was White Ajah. Her ivory-colored dress looked as
if it had had hard wear. For an instant Min saw an image of a raven floating beside her dark hair;
more a drawing of the bird than the bird itself. She thought it was a tattoo, but she did not know its
meaning. She concentrated on faces, tried not to see anything else. “He looks nearly dead in any
event,” Carlinya continued, hardly taking breath. “Whatever you thought, you have wasted your effort.
But I, too, would like to know how you came to Salidar.”
Siuan and Leane stood there exchanging smugly amused glances, while the onslaught went on.
No one even looked at them.
Myrelle, darkly beautiful in green silk embroidered on the bodice with slanting lines of gold, her
face a perfect oval, usually wore a knowing smile that at times could rival Leane’s new tricks. She
was not smiling now as she jumped in right behind the White sister. “Speak up, Min. Don’t stand
there gaping like a dolt.” She was noted for her fiery temper, even among the Greens.
“You must tell us,” Anaiya added in a more kindly voice. Exasperation tinged it, though. A
blunt-featured woman, and motherly despite Aes Sedai smoothness to her face, at the moment stroking
her pale gray skirts, she looked like a mother who was trying not to reach for a switch. “We will find
a place for you and these other two girls, but you must tell us how you came here.”
Min shook herself, and closed her mouth. Of course. These other two girls. She had grown so
used to them as they were that she no longer thought of how much they had changed. She doubted
whether any of these women had seen either since they were hauled off to the dungeons beneath the
White Tower. Leane looked ready to laugh, and Siuan all but shook her head in disgust at the Aes
Sedai.
“I am not the one you want to talk to,” Min told Sheriam. Let “these other two girls” have those
stares on them for a change. “Ask Siuan, or Leane.” They stared at her as if she were mad, until she
nodded to her two companions.
Four sets of Aes Sedai eyes shifted to the others, but there was no instant recognition. They
studied and frowned and passed glances between them. None of the Warders took their eyes from
Logain or their hands from their swords.
“Stilling might produce this effect,” Myrelle murmured finally. “I have read accounts that imply
as much.”
“The faces are close, in many ways,” Sheriam said slowly. “Someone could have found women
who look much like them, but why?”
Siuan and Leane did not look smug any longer. “We are who we are,” Leane said crisply.
“Question us. No impostor could know what we know.”

Siuan did not wait for questions. “My face may be changed, yet at least I know what I am doing
and why. That is more than I can say for you, I’ll wager.”
Min groaned at her steely tone, but Myrelle nodded, saying, “That is Siuan Sanche’s voice. It is
she.”
“Voices can be trained,” Carlinya said, still coolly calm.
“But how far can memories be taught?” Anaiya frowned sternly. “Siuan—if that is who you are
—on your twenty-second nameday we had an argument, you and I. Where did it occur, and what was
the outcome?”
Siuan smiled confidently at the motherly woman. “During your lecture to the Accepted on why so
many of the nations carved out of Artur Hawkwing’s empire after his death failed to survive. I still
disagree with you on some points, by the way. The outcome was that I spent two months working
three hours a day in the kitchens. ‘In the hope that the heat will overpower and diminish your ardor,’ I
think you said.”
If she had thought that one answer would be sufficient, she was wrong. Anaiya had more
questions, for both women, and so did Carlinya and Sheriam, who apparently had been novices and
Accepted with the pair. They were all about the sort of thing no impostor would be able to learn,
scrapes gotten into, pranks successful and not, opinions generally held of various Aes Sedai teachers.
Min could not believe that the women who would become the Amyrlin Seat and the Keeper of the
Chronicles could have dropped themselves into the soup so often, but she had the impression that this
was only the tip of a buried mountain, and it appeared that Sheriam herself might not have been far
behind them. Myrelle, the youngest by years, confined herself to amused comments, until Siuan said
something about a trout put into Saroiya Sedai’s bath and a novice taught to mind her ways for half a
year. Not that Siuan had much room to talk of anyone minding her ways. Washing a disliked
Accepted’s shifts with itchweed when she was a novice? Sneaking out of the Tower to go fishing?
Even Accepted needed permission to leave the Tower grounds except during certain hours. Siuan and
Leane together had even chilled a bucket of water to near freezing and set it so it would douse an Aes
Sedai who had had them switched, unfairly as they saw it. From the glint in Anaiya’s eyes, it was a
good thing for them that they had not been found out that time. From what Min knew of novice
training, and Accepted for that matter, these women were lucky that they had been allowed to remain
long enough to become Aes Sedai, much less that they still had whole hides.
“I am satisfied,” the motherly woman said at last, glancing at the others.
Myrelle nodded after Sheriam did, but Carlinya said, “There is still the question of what to do
with her.” She stared right at Siuan, unblinking, and the others suddenly seemed uneasy. Myrelle
pursed her lips, and Anaiya studied the floor. Smoothing her dress, Sheriam seemed to avoid looking
at the newcomers at all.
“We still know everything we knew before,” Leane told them, her sudden frown at least halfworry. “We can be of use.”
Siuan was dark-faced—Leane had seemed amused if anything at her recounted girlhood
misdeeds and penalties, but Siuan had not liked the telling one bit—yet in contrast to her near-glare,
her voice was only a little tight. “You wanted to know how we found you. I made contact with one of
my agents who also works for the Blue, and she told me of Sallie Daera.”
Min did not understand that about Sallie Daera at all—who was she?—but Sheriam and the
others nodded at one another. Siuan had done something other than tell them how, Min realized; she
had let them know that she still had access to the eyes-and-ears who had served her as Amyrlin.
“You sit over there, Min,” Sheriam told Min, pointing to the one table not in use, in a corner.

“Or are you still Elmindreda? And keep Logain with you.” She and the other three gathered Siuan and
Leane, herding them toward the back of the common room. Two more women in riding dresses joined
them before they vanished through a new-made door of uncured boards.
Sighing, Min took Logain’s arm and led him to the table, sat him down on a rough bench and took
a shaky ladder-back chair herself. Two of the Warders positioned themselves nearby, leaning against
the wall. They did not appear to be watching Logain, but Min knew the Gaidin; they saw everything,
and they could have their swords out in less than a heartbeat while sleeping.
So there were to be no open arms in welcome, even with Siuan and Leane recognized. Well,
what did she expect? Siuan and Leane had been the two most powerful women in the White Tower;
now they were not even Aes Sedai. The others very likely did not know how to behave toward them.
And appearing with a gentled false Dragon. Siuan had better not be lying or wishing about having a
plan for him. Min did not think Sheriam and the others would be as patient as Logain had been.
And Sheriam, at least, had recognized her. She stood again, long enough to peer through a crackpaned window into the street. Their horses were still at the hitching posts, but one of those Warders
who were not watching would have her before she had Wildrose’s reins untied. This last time in the
Tower, Siuan had gone to great lengths to disguise her. To no end, it seemed. She did not think any of
them knew about her viewings, though. Siuan and Leane had held that tightly to themselves. Min
would be just as glad if it remained that way. If these Aes Sedai learned of it, they would entangle her
just as Siuan had, and she would never reach Rand. She was not going to be able to show off what she
had learned from Leane if they kept her on a leash here.
Helping Siuan find this gathering, helping bring Aes Sedai to Rand’s aid, was all very well and
important, but she still had a personal goal. Making a man who had never looked at her twice fall in
love with her before he went mad. Maybe she was as mad as he was fated to be. “Then we’ll make a
matched pair,” she muttered to herself.
A freckled, green-eyed girl who had to be a novice stopped at her table. “Would you like
something to eat or drink? There is venison stew, and wild pears. There might be some cheese, too.”
She put so much effort into not looking at Logain that she might as well have stared pop-eyed.
“Pears and cheese sound very good,” Min told her. The last two days had been hungry; Siuan
had managed to catch some fish in a stream, but Logain had done all the hunting when they had not
eaten at an inn or a farm. Dried beans did not make a meal, in her opinion. “And some wine, if you
have it. But first, I would like some information. Where are we, if it isn’t a secret here, too? This
village is called Salidar?”
“In Altara. The Eldar is about a mile to the west. Amadicia is on the other side.” The girl put on
a poor imitation of Aes Sedai mystery. “Where better to hide Aes Sedai than where they would never
be looked for?”
“We should not have to hide,” a dark, curly-haired young woman snapped, stopping. Min
recognized her, an Accepted named Faolain; she would have expected her to be in the Tower still.
Faolain had never liked anyone or anything as far as Min knew, and had often spoken of choosing the
Red Ajah when she was raised. A perfect follower for Elaida. “Why did you come here? With him!
Why did she come?” There was no doubt in Min’s mind who she meant. “It is her fault we have to
hide. I did not believe she helped Mazrim Taim escape, but if she appears here with him, maybe she
did.”
“That will be enough, Faolain,” a slender woman with black hair spilling down her back to her
waist told the round-faced Accepted. Min thought she knew the woman in the dark golden silk riding
dress. Edesina. A Yellow, she believed. “Go about your duties,” Edesina said. “And if you mean to

bring food, Tabiya, do it.” Edesina did not watch Faolain’s sullen curtsy—the novice gave a better
and scurried away—but put a hand on Logain’s head instead. Eyes on the table, he did not seem to
notice.
To Min’s eyes, a silvery collar suddenly appeared, snug around the woman’s neck, and as
suddenly seemed to shatter. Min shivered. She did not like viewings connected to the Seanchan. At
least Edesina would escape somehow. Even if Min had been willing to expose herself, there was no
point in warning the woman; it would not change anything.
“It is the gentling,” the Aes Sedai said after a moment. “He has given up on wanting to live, I
suppose. There is nothing I can do for him. Not that I am sure I should if I could.” The look she gave
Min before leaving was far from friendly.
An elegant, statuesque woman in russet silk paused a few feet away, coolly examining Min and
Logain with expressionless eyes. Kiruna was a Green, and regal in her manner; she was a sister of the
King of Arafel, so Min had heard, but she had been friendly to Min in the Tower. Min smiled, but
those large dark eyes swept over her without recognition, and Kiruna glided out of the inn, four
Warders, disparate men but all with that deadly-seeming way of moving, suddenly heeling her.
Waiting for her food, Min hoped that Siuan and Leane were finding a warmer reception.

CHAPTER
27

The Practice of Diffidence

You are rudderless,” Siuan told the six women facing her in six different sorts of chair. The
room itself was a muddle. Two large kitchen tables against the walls held pens and ink jars and sand
bottles in neat arrays. Mismatched lamps, some glazed pottery and some gilded, and candles in every
thickness and length stood ready to provide light at nightfall. A scrap of Illianer silk carpet, rich in
blues and reds and gold, lay on a floor of rough, weathered planks. She and Leane had been seated
across the piece of carpet from the others, in such a way that they were the focus of every eye. Open
casement windows with panes cracked or replaced by oiled silk let a breath of air stir in, but not
enough to cut the heat. Siuan told herself that she did not envy these women their ability to channel—
she was past that, surely—but she did envy the way none of them perspired. Her own face was quite
damp. “All that activity out there is play and show. You might be fooling each other, and maybe even
the Gaidin—though I’d not count on that, were I you—but you can’t fool me.”
She wished that Morvrin and Beonin had not been added to the group. Morvrin was skeptical of
everything despite her placid, sometimes vaguely absent look, a stout Brown with gray-streaked hair
who demanded six pieces of evidence before she would believe fish had scales. And Beonin, a pretty
Gray with dark honey hair and blue-gray eyes so big they constantly made her appear slightly startled
—Beonin made Morvrin seem gullible.
“Elaida has the Tower in her fist, and you know she will mishandle Rand al’Thor,” Siuan said
scornfully. “It will be pure luck if she doesn’t panic and have him gentled before Tarmon Gai’don.
You know that whatever you feel about a man channeling, Reds feel ten times more. The White Tower
is at its weakest when it should be at its strongest, in the hands of a fool when it must have skilled
command.” She wrinkled her nose, staring them in the eye one by one. “And you sit here, drifting with
your sails down. Or can you convince me that you are doing more than twiddling your thumbs and
blowing bubbles?”
“Do you agree with Siuan, Leane?” Anaiya asked mildly. Siuan had never been able to
understand why Moiraine liked the woman. Trying to get her to do anything she did not want to was
like hitting a sack of feathers. She did not stand up to you, or argue; she just silently refused to move.
Even the way she sat, with her hands folded, looked more like a woman waiting to knead dough than
an Aes Sedai.
“In part I do,” Leane replied. Siuan gave her a sharp look that she ignored. “About Elaida,
certainly. Elaida will misuse Rand al’Thor, as surely as she is misusing the Tower. For the rest, I
know that you have worked hard to gather as many sisters here as you have, and I expect that you are
working just as hard to do something about Elaida.”
Siuan sniffed loudly. On her way through the common room she had snatched glimpses of some

of those parchments being examined so assiduously. Lists of provisions, allotments of timber for
rebuilding, assignments for woodcutting and repairing houses and cleaning out wells. Nothing more.
Nothing that looked the least like a report on Elaida’s activities. They were planning to winter here.
All it took was one Blue being captured after she had learned of Salidar, one woman being put to the
question—she would not hold back much if Alviarin had charge of it—and Elaida would know
exactly where to net them. While they worried about planting vegetable gardens and having enough
firewood cut before the first freeze.
“Then that is out of the way,” Carlinya said coolly. “You do not seem to understand that you are
not Amyrlin and Keeper any longer. You are not even Aes Sedai.” Some had the grace to look
embarrassed. Not Morvrin or Beonin, but the others. No Aes Sedai liked to speak of stilling, or be
reminded of it; they would think it especially harsh in front of the two of them. “I do not say this to be
cruel. We do not believe the charges against you—despite your traveling companion—or we would
not be here, but you cannot assume your old places among us, and that is a simple fact.”
Siuan remembered Carlinya well as novice and Accepted. Once a month she had committed
some minor offense, a small thing that earned her an extra hour or two of chores. Exactly once each
month. She had not wanted the others to think her a prig. Those had been her only offenses—she never
broke another rule or put a foot wrong; it would not have been logical—yet she had never understood
why the other girls had considered her an Aes Sedai pet anyway. A great deal of logic and not much
common sense: that was Carlinya.
“While what was done to you followed the letter of the law narrowly,” Sheriam said gently, “we
agree that it was malignantly unjust, an extreme distortion of the law’s spirit.” The chairback behind
her fire-red head was incongruously carved with what seemed to be a mass of snakes fighting.
“Whatever rumor might say, most of the charges laid against you were so thin that they should have
been laughed away.”
“Not the charge that she knew of Rand al’Thor and conspired to hide him from the Tower,”
Carlinya broke in sharply.
Sheriam nodded. “But be that as it may, even that was not sufficient for the penalty given. Nor
should you have been tried in secret, without even a chance to defend yourself. Never fear that we
will turn our backs on you. We will see that you both are cared for.”
“I thank you,” Leane said, her voice soft and almost trembling.
Siuan grimaced at them. “You haven’t even asked me about the eyes-and-ears I can use.” She
had liked Sheriam when they were students together, though years and position had opened water
between them. “Cared for” indeed! “Is Aeldene here?” Anaiya started to shake her head before
stopping herself. “I suspected not, or you would know more of what is going on. You’ve left them
sending their reports to the Tower.” Slow realization dawned on their faces; they had not known
Aeldene’s office. “I headed the Blue Ajah’s net of eyes-and-ears, before I was raised Amyrlin.”
More surprise. “With a little effort every Blue agent, and those who served me as Amyrlin, too, can
be sending her reports to you, by routes that keep her ignorant of their final destination.” It would take
considerably more than a little work, but she had already sketched most of it out in her head, and there
was no need for them to know more at the moment. “And they can continue sending reports to the
Tower, reports containing what . . . you want Elaida to believe.” She had almost said “we”; she had
to watch her tongue.
They did not like it, of course. The women who tended the networks might be unknown to all but
a few, but they were every one Aes Sedai. They had always been Aes Sedai. But that was her only
lever with which to pry her way into the circles where decisions were made. Otherwise, they would

likely stuff her and Leane into a cottage with a servant to look after them, and maybe a rare visit from
Aes Sedai who wanted to examine women who had been stilled, until they died. They would die
soon, in those circumstances.
Light, they might even marry us off! Some thought that a husband and children could occupy a
woman enough to replace the One Power in her life. More than one woman, stilled by drawing too
much of saidar to herself, or in testing ter’angreal for their uses, had found herself being matched
with potential husbands. Since those who did marry always put as much distance as possible between
themselves and the Tower and its memories, the theory remained unproven.
“It should not be difficult,” Leane said diffidently, “to put myself in touch with those who were
my eyes-and-ears before I was Keeper. More importantly, as Keeper of the Chronicles I had agents in
Tar Valon itself.” Startlement widened a few eyes, though Carlinya’s narrowed. Leane blinked,
shifted uneasily, smiled weakly. “I always thought it foolish that we paid more attention to the mood
of Ebou Dar or Bandar Eban than to the mood of our own city.” They had to see the value of eyesand-ears in Tar Valon.
“Siuan.” Leaning forward in her thick-armed chair, Morvrin said the name firmly, as though to
emphasize that she had not said Mother. That round face looked more stubborn than placid now, her
stoutness a threatening mass. When Siuan had been a novice, Morvrin rarely seemed to notice the
mischief of the girls around her, but when she did, she had taken care of matters herself, in ways that
had everyone sitting straight and walking small for days. “Why should we allow you to do as you
want? You have been stilled, woman. Whatever you were, you are no longer Aes Sedai. If we want
these agents’ names, you will both give them to us.” There was a flat certainty to that last; they would
give them, one way or another. They would, if these women wanted them enough.
Leane shivered visibly, but Siuan’s chair creaked as she stiffened her back. “I know that I am not
Amyrlin anymore. Do you think I don’t know I was stilled? My face is changed, but not what is
inside. Everything I ever knew is still in my head. Use it! For the love of the Light, use me!” She took
a deep breath to calm herself—Burn me if I let them shove me aside to rot!—and Myrelle spoke into
the pause.
“A young woman’s temper to go with a young woman’s face.” Smiling, she sat on the edge of a
stiff-backed armchair that could have stood in front of a farmer’s fireplace, if the farmer had not
cared that the varnish was flaking. The smile was not her usual one, though, languid and knowing at
the same time, and her dark eyes, nearly as large as Beonin’s, were full of sympathy. “I am sure that
no one wants you to feel useless, Siuan. And I am sure that we all want to employ your knowledge
fully. What you know will be of great use to us.”
Siuan did not want her sympathy. “You seem to have forgotten Logain, and why I dragged him all
the way here from Tar Valon.” She had not meant to bring this up herself, but if they were going to let
it lie wallowing . . . “My ‘crackbrained’ idea?”
“Very well, Siuan,” Sheriam said. “Why?”
“Because the first step to pulling Elaida down is for Logain to reveal to the Tower, to the world
if need be, that the Red Ajah set him up as a false Dragon so that he could be pulled down.” She
certainly had their attention now. “He was found by Reds in Ghealdan at least a year before he
proclaimed himself, but instead of bringing him to Tar Valon to be gentled, they planted the idea in
his head of claiming to be the Dragon Reborn.”
“You are certain of this?” Beonin asked quietly, in a heavy Taraboner accent. She sat very still
in her tall, cane-bottomed chair, watching carefully.
“He does not know who Leane and I are. He talked with us sometimes on the journey here, late

at night when Min was sleeping and he could not rest. He said nothing before because he thinks the
entire Tower was behind it, but he knows that it was Red sisters who shielded him and talked to him
of the Dragon Reborn.”
“Why?” Morvrin demanded, and Sheriam nodded.
“Yes, why? Any of us would go out of our way to see a man like that gentled, but the Red Ajah
lives for nothing else. Why would they create a false Dragon?”
“Logain did not know,” she told them. “Perhaps they think they gain more by capturing a false
Dragon than gentling a poor fool who might terrorize one village. Perhaps they have some reason to
want more turmoil.”
“We do not suggest they’ve had anything to do with Mazrim Taim or any of the others,” Leane
added quickly. “Elaida will no doubt be able to tell you what you want to know.”
Siuan watched them mull it over in silence. They never considered the possibility that she was
lying. An advantage to having been stilled. It did not seem to occur to them that being stilled might
have broken all ties to the Three Oaths. Some Aes Sedai studied stilled women, true, but gingerly and
reluctantly. No one wanted to be reminded of what might happen to herself.
For Logain, Siuan had no worry. Not as long as Min continued to see whatever it was that she
saw. He would live long enough to reveal what Siuan wanted him to, once she had talked to him. She
had not dared risk his deciding to go his own way, which he might well have done had she told him
before. But it was his one chance for revenge now against those who had gentled him, surrounded by
Aes Sedai again as he was. Revenge only against the Red Ajah, true, but he would have to settle for
that. A fish in the boat was worth a school in the water.
She glanced at Leane, who smiled the faintest possible smile. That was good. Leane had disliked
being kept in the dark about her plan for the man until this morning, but Siuan had lived too long
wrapped in secrecy to be easy revealing more than she had to, even to a friend. She thought that the
idea of Red Ajah involvement with other false Dragons had been neatly planted. Reds had been the
leaders in overthrowing her. There might not be a Red Ajah once this was done with.
“This changes a great deal,” Sheriam said after a time. “We cannot possibly follow an Amyrlin
who would do such a thing.”
“Follow her!” Siuan exclaimed, for the first time truly startled. “You were actually considering
going back to kiss Elaida’s ring? Knowing what she has done, and will do?” Leane quivered in her
seat as if she wanted to say a few choice words herself, but they had agreed that Siuan was to be the
one to lose her temper.
Sheriam looked a trifle embarrassed, and spots of color floated in Myrelle’s olive cheeks, but
the others took it as calmly as sunshine.
“The Tower must be strong,” Carlinya said in a voice as hard as winter stone. “The Dragon has
been Reborn, the Last Battle is coming, and the Tower must be whole.”
Anaiya nodded. “We understand your reasons for disliking Elaida, even hating her. We do
understand, but we must think of the Tower, and the world. I confess I do not like Elaida myself. But
then, I have never liked Siuan, either. It is not necessary to like the Amyrlin Seat. There is no need to
glare so, Siuan. You have had a file for a tongue since you were a novice, and it has only roughened
with the years. And as Amyrlin, you pushed sisters where you wanted and only seldom explained
why. The two do not make a likable combination.”
“I will try to . . . smooth my tongue,” Siuan said dryly. Did the woman expect the Amyrlin Seat
to treat every sister like a childhood friend? “But I hope what I’ve told you changes your desire to
kneel at Elaida’s feet?”

“If that is your smoother tongue,” Myrelle said idly, “I may have to smooth it myself, if we do
allow you to run the eyes-and-ears for us.”
“We cannot go back to the Tower now, of course,” Sheriam said. “Not knowing this. Not until
we are in position to see Elaida deposed.”
“Whatever she has done, the Reds, they will continue to support her.” Beonin stated it as fact,
not objection. It was no secret that the Reds resented the fact that there had not been an Amyrlin from
their Ajah since Bonwhin.
Morvrin nodded heavily. “Others will, as well. Those who have thrown themselves too much
behind Elaida to believe they have any other choice. Those who will support authority, however vile.
And some who will believe we are dividing the Tower when it must be whole at any cost.”
“All but the Red sisters can be approached,” Beonin said judiciously, “negotiated with.”
Mediation and negotiation were her Ajah’s reason for existence.
“It seems we will have a use for your agents, Siuan.” Sheriam looked around at the others.
“Unless anyone still thinks we should take them away from her?” Morvrin was the last to shake her
head, but she did it, finally, after a long study that made Siuan feel she had been stripped, weighed
and measured.
She could not stop a sigh of relief. Not a short life drying up in a cottage, but a life of purpose. It
might still be a short life—no one knew how long a stilled woman could live given something to
replace the One Power in her life—but with purpose it would be long enough. So Myrelle was going
to smooth her tongue for her, was she? I’ll show that fox-eyed Green—I will hold my tongue and be
glad she isn’t doing more than look at me is what I’ll do. I knew how this would go. Burn me, but I
did.
“Thank you, Aes Sedai,” she said in the meekest tone she could find. To call them that pained
her; it was another break, another reminder of what she was not any longer. “I will try to give good
service.” Myrelle did not have to nod in such a satisfied way. Siuan ignored a small voice that said
she would have done as much or more in Myrelle’s place.
“If I may suggest,” Leane said, “it is not enough to wait until you have enough support in the Hall
of the Tower to depose Elaida.” Siuan put on an interested look, as though hearing this for the first
time. “Elaida sits in Tar Valon, in the White Tower, and to the world she is Amyrlin. At the moment,
you are only a flock of dissidents. She can call you rebels and agitators, and coming from the Amyrlin
Seat, the world will believe it.”
“We can hardly stop her being Amyrlin before she is deposed,” Carlinya said, shifting on her
chair in icy contempt. Had she been wearing her white-fringed shawl, she would have snapped it
around her.
“You can give the world a true Amyrlin.” Leane spoke not to the White sister, but to all of them,
eyeing each in turn, sure of what she was saying yet at the same time offering a suggestion that she
merely hoped they would take. It had been Siuan who pointed out that the techniques she employed on
men could be adapted for women. “I saw Aes Sedai from every Ajah save the Red in the common
room, and in the streets. Have them elect a Hall of the Tower here, and let that Hall select a new
Amyrlin. Then you can present yourselves to the world as the true White Tower, in exile, and Elaida
as a usurper. With Logain’s revelations added in, can you doubt who the nations will accept as the
real Amyrlin Seat?”
The idea took hold. Siuan could see them turning it over in their minds. Whatever the others
thought, only Sheriam voiced a word against. “It will mean that the Tower truly is broken,” the greeneyed woman said sadly.

“It already is broken,” Siuan told her tartly, and instantly wished she had not when they all
looked at her.
This was supposed to be purely Leane’s notion. She herself had a reputation as a deft
manipulator, and they could well be suspicious of anything she proposed. That was why she had
begun by scathing them; they would not have believed her if she had begun with mild words. She
would come at them as if she still thought herself Amyrlin, and let them put her in her place. By
comparison, Leane would seem more cooperative, only offering the little she could, and they would
be more likely to listen to her. Doing her own part had not been difficult—until it came to pleading;
then she had wanted to hang them all in the sun to dry. Sitting here, doing nothing!
You didn’t have to worry about them being suspicious. They think you are a broken reed. If
everything went properly, they would not learn differently. A useful reed, but a weak one, not to be
thought of twice. It was a painful accommodation to make, but Duranda Tharne had shown her the
necessity in Lugard. They would accept her only on their terms, and she would have to make the best
of it.
“I wish I had thought of this myself,” she went on. “Now that I hear it, Leane’s idea gives you a
way to build the Tower again without having to tear it down completely first.”
“I still cannot like it.” Sheriam’s voice firmed. “But what must be must be. The Wheel weaves
as the Wheel wills, and the Light willing, it will weave Elaida out of the stole.”
“We will need to negotiate with those sisters who remain in the Tower,” Beonin mused, only
half to herself. “The Amyrlin we choose, she must be a skilled negotiator, yes?”
“Clear thinking will be needed,” Carlinya put in. “The new Amyrlin must be a woman of cool
reason and logic.”
Morvrin’s snort was loud enough to make everyone jump in their chairs. “Sheriam is the highest
among us, and she has kept us together when we’d have been running in ten different directions.”
Sheriam shook her head vigorously, but Myrelle gave her no chance to speak. “Sheriam is an
excellent choice. I can promise every Green sister here behind her, I know.” Anaiya opened her
mouth, agreement plain on her face.
It was time to put a stop to this before it got out of hand. “If I may suggest?” Siuan thought she
managed diffidence much better than she had meekness. It was a strain, but she thought she had better
learn to maintain it. Myrelle isn’t the only one who will try to stuff me in the bilges if they think
I’ve overstepped my place. Whatever it is. Only, they would not try; they would do. Aes Sedai
expected—no, required—respect from those who were not. “It seems to me that whoever you choose
should be someone who was not in the Tower when I . . . was deposed. Would it not be best if the
woman who unites the Tower again was one whom no one could accuse of choosing a side on that
day?” If she had to keep this up, she was going to burst a seam in her head.
“Someone very strong in the Power,” Leane added. “The stronger she is, the more she can stand
for all that the Tower means. Or will again, once Elaida is gone.”
Siuan could have kicked her. That thought was supposed to wait a full day, to be tossed in once
they actually began considering names. Between them, she and Leane knew enough of every sister to
find some weakness, some doubt to be dangled subtly as to her fitness for stole and staff. She would
rather wade naked through a school of silverpike than have these women realize that she was trying to
manipulate them.
“A sister who was out of the Tower,” Sheriam said, nodding. “That makes excellent sense,
Siuan. Very good.” How easily they slipped into patting her on the head.
Morvrin pursed her lips. “It will not be easy, finding whoever we choose.”

“Strength narrows the possibilities.” Anaiya looked around at the others. “It will not only make
her a better symbol, to the other sisters at least, but strength in the Power often goes with strength of
will, and whoever we choose will surely need that.”
Carlinya and Beonin were the last to join in agreement.
Siuan kept her face smooth, her smile on the inside. The breaking of the Tower had changed
many things, many ways of thinking besides her own. These women had led the Sisters gathered here,
and now they were discussing who should be presented to their new Hall of the Tower as if that
should not be the Hall’s choice. It would not be difficult to bring them around, ever so gently, to the
belief that the new Amyrlin should be one who could be guided by them. And unknowing, they and the
Amyrlin she chose for her replacement, would be guided by herself. She and Moiraine had worked
too long to find Rand al’Thor and prepare him, given too much of their lives, for her to risk the rest of
it being bungled by someone else.
“If I may make another suggestion?” Diffidence was simply not in her nature; she was going to
have to find something else. She waited, trying not to grit her teeth, for Sheriam to nod before going
on. “Elaida will be attempting to discover where Rand al’Thor is; the farther south I came, the more
rumors I heard that he has left Tear. I think that he has, and I think that I have reasoned out where he
went.”
There was no need for her to say that they had to find him before Tar Valon did. They all
understood. Not only would Elaida mishandle him, certainly, but should she put her hands on him,
display him shielded and in her control, any hope of toppling her would be gone. Rulers knew the
Prophecies, if their people usually did not; they would forgive her a dozen false Dragons out of
necessity.
“Where?” Morvrin barked, a hair ahead of Sheriam, Anaiya and Myrelle all together.
“The Aiel Waste.”
There was a moment of silence before Carlinya said, “That is ridiculous.”
Siuan bit back an angry reply and smiled what she hoped was an apologetic smile. “Perhaps, but
I read something of the Aiel when I was Accepted. Gitara Moroso thought that some of the Aiel Wise
Ones might be able to channel.” Gitara had been Keeper then. “One of the books she had me read, an
old thing from the dustiest corner of the library, claimed that the Aiel call themselves the People of
the Dragon. I did not remember it until I tried puzzling out where Rand could have vanished to. The
Prophecies say ‘the Stone of Tear shall never fall till the People of the Dragon come,’ and there were
Aiel in the taking of the Stone. That, every rumor and tale agrees on.”
Morvrin’s eyes suddenly seemed to look elsewhere. “I remember speculation about the Wise
Ones when I was newly raised to the shawl. It would be fascinating, if true, but Aiel are little more
welcoming to Aes Sedai than to anyone else who enters the Waste, and their Wise Ones apparently
have some law or custom against speaking to strangers, so I understand, which makes it extremely
hard to come close enough to one to feel if she—” Suddenly she gave herself a shake, staring at Siuan
and Leane as though her wandering had been their fault. “A thin straw to weave a basket, something
you remember from a book likely written by someone who never saw an Aiel.”
“A very thin straw,” Carlinya said.
“But worth sending someone to the Waste?” It took effort to make that a question instead of a
demand. Siuan thought she might sweat down to nothing if she could not find another way. She still
had enough control of herself to ignore the heat, usually, but not while trying to drag these women
along without letting them notice her fist in their hair. “I do not think the Aiel would try to harm an
Aes Sedai.” Not if she was quick enough to show that she was Aes Sedai. Siuan did not think they

would. It had to be risked. “And if he is in the Waste, the Aiel will know of it. Remember those Aiel
at the Stone.”
“Perhaps,” Beonin said slowly. “The Waste is large. How many would we need to send?”
“If the Dragon Reborn is in the Waste,” Anaiya said, “the first Aiel met will know of it. Events
follow this Rand al’Thor, by all accounts. He could not slip into the ocean without making a splash
heard in every corner of the world.”
Myrelle smiled. “She should be Green. None of the rest of you will bond more than one Warder,
and two or three Gaidin might be very useful in the Waste until the Aiel know her for Aes Sedai. I
have always wanted to see an Aiel.” She had been a novice during the Aiel War, and not allowed out
of the Tower. Not that any Aes Sedai had taken part beyond Healing, of course. The Three Oaths had
bound them unless Tar Valon, or maybe even the Tower itself, was attacked, and that war had never
crossed the rivers.
“Not you,” Sheriam told her, “or any other member of this council. You agreed to see this
through, Myrelle, when you agreed to sit with us, and that does not include gallivanting off because
you are bored. I fear there will be more excitement than any of us could wish, before we finish.” She
would have made an excellent Amyrlin in other circumstances; in these, she was simply too strong
and sure of herself. “But Greens . . . Yes, I think so. Two?” Her green eyes swept along the others.
“To be certain?”
“Kiruna Nachiman?” Anaiya offered, and Beonin added, “Bera Harkin?” The others nodded,
except for Myrelle, who shifted her shoulders irritably. Aes Sedai did not pout, but she came close.
Siuan took her second relieved breath. She was certain her reasoning was correct. He had
vanished to somewhere, and if he was anywhere between the Spine of the World and the Aryth
Ocean, rumors would have been flying. And wherever he was, Moiraine would be there with a hand
on his collar. Kiruna and Bera would surely be willing to carry a letter to Moiraine, and they had
seven Warders between them to keep the Aiel from killing them.
“We do not want to tire you and Leane,” Sheriam went on. “I will ask one of the Yellow sisters
to look at both of you. Perhaps she can do something to help, to ease you in some way. I will have
rooms found for you, where you can rest.”
“If you are to be our mistress of eyes-and-ears,” Myrelle added solicitously, “you must maintain
your strength.”
“I am not so frail as you seem to think,” Siuan protested. “If I were, could I have followed you
nearly two thousand miles? Whatever weakness I had after being stilled is gone, believe me.” The
truth was that she had found a center of power again, and she did not want to leave it, but she could
hardly say that. All those concerned eyes on her, and Leane. Well, not Carlinya’s particularly, but the
rest. Light! They’re going to have a novice tuck us into bed for a nap!
A knock at the door was followed immediately by Arinvar, Sheriam’s Warder. Cairhienin, he
was not tall, and slender besides, but in spite of gray at his temples he was hard of face, and he
moved like a stalking leopard. “There are twenty-odd riders to the east,” he said without preamble.
“Not Whitecloaks,” Carlinya said, “or I presume you would have reported as much.”
Sheriam gave her a look. Many sisters could be prickly when it came to another stepping
between them and their Gaidin. “We cannot allow them to get away, and perhaps carry word of our
presence. Can they be captured, Arinvar? I would prefer that to killing them.”
“Either may be difficult,” he replied. “Machan says they are armed and have the look of
veterans. Worth ten times their number of younger men.”
Morvrin made a vexed sound. “We must do one or the other. Forgive me, Sheriam. Arinvar, can

the Gaidin sneak some of the more agile sisters close enough to weave Air around them?”
He shook his head fractionally. “Machan says they may have seen some of the Warders keeping
watch. They would certainly see if we tried to bring more than one or two of you near. They are still
coming, though.”
Siuan and Leane were not the only ones to exchange startled glances. Few men saw a Warder
who did not want to be seen, even without the Gaidin cloak.
“Then you must do as you think best,” Sheriam said. “Capture them, if possible. But none must
escape to betray us.”
Before Arinvar could complete his bow, hand to sword hilt, another man was beside him, a dark
bear of a man, tall and wide, with hair to his shoulders and a short beard that left his upper lip bare.
That flowing Warder movement seemed odd on him. He winked at Myrelle, his Aes Sedai, even as he
said in a thick Illianer accent, “Most of the riders do be stopped, but one does come on by himself. If
my aged mother did say different, I would still name him Gareth Bryne from the glimpse I did get.”
Siuan stared at him; her hands and feet suddenly felt cold. Strong rumor said that Myrelle had
actually married this Nuhel and her other two Warders, in defiance of convention and law in every
land Siuan had ever heard of. It was the sort of incongruous thought that drifted through a stunned
mind, and right then she felt as if a mast had fallen on her head. Bryne, here? It’s impossible! It is
mad! Surely the man could not have followed them all this way for . . . Oh yes, he could and would.
That one would. As they journeyed, she had told herself that it was only sensible caution to leave no
trace behind, that Elaida knew they were not dead, whatever the rumors said, and she would not stop
hunting until they were found or she was pulled down. Siuan had been irritated at having to ask
directions finally, yet the thought that had snapped at her like a shark had not been that Elaida might
somehow find a blacksmith in one small Altaran village, but that the blacksmith would be like a
painted sign for Bryne. Told yourself it was foolish, didn’t you? And now here he is.
She well remembered her confrontation with him, when she had had to bend him to her will on
that matter of Murandy. It had been like bending a thick iron bar, or some huge spring that would leap
back if she let up for an instant. She had had to bring all of her force to bear, had had to humiliate him
publicly, in order to make certain he would remain bent for as long as she needed. He could hardly go
against what he had agreed to on his knees, begging her pardon, with fifty nobles watching. Morgase
had been difficult enough herself, and Siuan had not been willing to risk Bryne giving Morgase an
excuse to go against her instructions. Strange to think that she and Elaida had worked together then,
bringing Morgase to heel.
She had to take hold of herself. She was in a daze, thinking of everything except what she needed
to. Concentrate. This is no time to panic. “You must send him away. Or kill him.”
She knew it for a mistake while the words were still leaving her mouth, all too full of urgency.
Even the Warders looked at her, and the Aes Sedai. . . . She had never before known what it felt like
for someone who lacked the Power to have those eyes turned on them at full strength. She felt naked,
her very mind laid bare. Even knowing that Aes Sedai could not read thoughts, she still wanted to
confess before they listed her lies and crimes. She hoped that her face was not like Leane’s, redcheeked and wide-eyed.
“You know why he is here.” Sheriam’s voice was calmly certain. “Both of you do. And you do
not want to confront him. Enough so that you would have us kill him for you.”
“There do be few great captains living.” Nuhel marked them off on gauntleted fingers. “Agelmar
Jagad and Davram Bashere will no leave the Blight, I think, and Pedron Niall will surely no be of use
to you. If Rodel Ituralde do be alive, he do be mired somewhere in what do remain of Arad Doman.”

He raised his thick thumb. “And that do leave Gareth Bryne.”
“Do you think that we will need a great captain, then?” Sheriam asked quietly.
Nuhel and Arinvar did not look at one another, but Siuan still had the feeling that they had
exchanged glances. “It is your decision, Sheriam,” Arinvar replied just as quietly, “yours and the
other sisters, but if you mean to return to the Tower, we could use him. If you intend to remain here
until Elaida sends for you, then not.” Myrelle gazed at Nuhel questioningly, and he nodded.
“It seems that you were right, Siuan,” Anaiya said wryly. “We have not fooled the Gaidin.”
“The question is whether he will agree to serve us,” Carlinya said, and Morvrin nodded, adding,
“We must make him see our cause in such a way that he wishes to serve. It will not help us if it
becomes known that we killed or imprisoned so notable a man before we have even begun.”
“Yes,” Beonin said, “and we must offer him the rewards that will bind him to us firmly.”
Sheriam turned her eyes on the two men. “When Lord Bryne reaches the village, tell him nothing,
but bring him to us.” As soon as the door closed behind the Warders, her gaze firmed. Siuan
recognized it; the same clear green stare that had novices’ knees knocking before a word was said.
“Now. You will tell us exactly why Gareth Bryne is here.”
There was no choice. If they caught her in even the tiniest lie, they would begin to question
everything. Siuan took a deep breath. “We took shelter for the night in a barn near Kore Springs, in
Andor. Bryne is the lord there, and . . .”

CHAPTER
28

Trapped

A Warder in a gray-green coat approached Bryne as soon as he rode Traveler past the first
stone houses of the village. Bryne would have known the man for a Warder after watching him walk
two strides, even without all the Aes Sedai faces staring at him in the street. What in the name of the
Light were so many Aes Sedai doing this close to Amadicia? Rumor in villages behind said Ailron
meant to claim this bank of the River Eldar, which meant the Whitecloaks did. Aes Sedai could
defend themselves well, but if Niall sent a legion across the Eldar, a good many of these women
would die. Unless he could no longer tell how long a stump had been exposed to air, this place had
been buried in the forest two months ago. What had Mara gotten herself into? He was sure he would
find her here; village men remembered three pretty young women traveling together, especially when
one of them asked directions to a town abandoned since the Whitecloak War.
The Warder, a big man with a broad face, an Illianer by his beard, planted himself in the street
in front of Bryne’s big-nosed bay gelding and bowed. “Lord Bryne? I am Nuhel Dromand. If you will
come with me, there are those who do wish to speak with you.”
Bryne dismounted slowly, pulling off his gauntlets and tucking them behind his sword belt as he
studied the town. The plain buff-colored coat he wore now was much better for a journey of this sort
than the gray silk he had started in; that, he had given away. Aes Sedai and Warders, and others,
watched him silently, but even those who had to be servants did not look surprised. And Dromand
knew his name. His face was not unknown, but he suspected more than that. If Mara was—if they
were Aes Sedai agents, it did not alter the oath they had taken. “Lead on, Nuhel Gaidin.” If Nuhel was
surprised at the address, he did not show it.
The inn that Dromand took him to—or what had been an inn once—had the look of headquarters
for a campaign, all bustle and scurry. That is, if Aes Sedai had ever commanded a campaign. He
spotted Serenla before she did him, seated in the corner with a big man who was very likely Dalyn.
When she did see him, her chin dropped almost to the table, and then she squinted at him as if not
believing her eyes. Dalyn appeared to be asleep with his eyes open, staring at nothing. None of the
Aes Sedai or Warders seemed to notice as Dromand led him through, but Bryne would have wagered
his manor and lands that any one of them had seen ten times as much as all the staring servants
combined. He should have turned and ridden away as soon as he realized who was in this village.
He took careful note as he made his bows while the Warder introduced him to the six seated Aes
Sedai—only a fool was careless around Aes Sedai—but his mind was on the two young women
standing against the wall beside the fresh-swept fireplace and looking chastened. The willowy
Domani minx was offering him a smile more tremulous than seductive for a change. Mara was
frightened, too—terrified out of her skin, he would say—but those blue eyes still met his full of

defiance. The girl had courage to suit a lion.
“We are pleased to greet you, Lord Bryne,” the flame-haired Aes Sedai said. Just slightly plump,
and with those tilted eyes, she was pretty enough to make any man look twice despite the Great
Serpent ring on her finger. “Will you tell us what brings you here?”
“Of course, Sheriam Sedai.” Nuhel stood at his shoulder, but if any women needed less guarding
from one old soldier, Bryne could not imagine who. He was sure that they knew already, and
watching their faces while he told the tale confirmed it. Aes Sedai let nothing be seen that they did not
want seen, but at least one of them would have blinked when he spoke of the oath if they had not
known beforehand.
“A dreadful story to relate, Lord Bryne.” That was the one called Anaiya; ageless face or not,
she looked more like a happy, prosperous farmwife than an Aes Sedai. “Yet I am surprised that you
followed so far, even after oathbreakers.” Mara’s fair cheeks flushed a furious red. “Still, a strong
oath, one that should not be broken.”
“Unfortunately,” Sheriam said, “we cannot let you take them quite yet.”
So they were Aes Sedai agents. “A strong oath that should not be broken, yet you mean to keep
them from honoring it?”
“They will honor it,” Myrelle said, with a glance at the pair by the fireplace that made them both
stand straighter, “and you may rest assured that they already regret running away after giving it.” This
time it was Amaena who reddened; Mara looked ready to chew rocks. “But we cannot allow it yet.”
No Ajahs had been mentioned, yet he thought the darkly pretty woman was Green, and the stout,
round-faced one called Morvrin was Brown. Perhaps it was the smile that Myrelle had given
Dromand when the man brought him in, and Morvrin’s air of thinking of something else. “In truth, they
did not say when they would serve, and we have a use for them.”
This was foolish; he should apologize for disturbing them and leave. And that was foolish, too.
He had known before Dromand reached him in the street that he was unlikely to leave Salidar alive.
There were probably fifty Warders in the forest around where he had left his men, if not a hundred.
Joni and the others would give a good account of themselves, but he had not brought them all this way
to die. Yet if he was a fool to have let a pair of eyes lure him into this trap, he might as well go the
last mile for it. “Arson, theft and assault, Aes Sedai. Those were the crimes. They were tried,
sentenced, and sworn. But I have no objection to remaining here until you are done with them. Mara
can act as my dog robber when you do not need her. I will mark the hours she works for me, and count
them against her service.”
Mara opened her mouth angrily, but almost as if the women had known that she would try to
speak, six pairs of Aes Sedai eyes swiveled to her in unison. She shifted her shoulders, snapped her
mouth shut, and then glared at him, fists rigidly at her sides. He was glad she did not have a knife in
her hand.
Myrelle appeared close to laughter. “Better to choose the other, Lord Bryne. From the way she
is looking at you, you would find her far more . . . congenial.”
He half-expected Amaena to go crimson, but she did not. And she was eyeing him—
appraisingly. She even shared a smile with Myrelle. Well, she was Domani after all, and
considerably more so than when he saw her last, it seemed.
Carlinya, cold enough to make the others seem warm, leaned forward. He was wary of her, and
of the big-eyed one named Beonin. He was not sure why. Except that if he were in the Game of
Houses here, he would say both women reeked of ambition. Maybe he was involved in exactly that.
“You should be aware,” Carlinya said coolly, “that the woman you know as Mara is in reality

Siuan Sanche, formerly the Amyrlin Seat: Amaena is really Leane Sharif, who was Keeper of the
Chronicles.”
It was all he could do not to gape like a country lout. Now that he knew, he could see it in
Mara’s face—in Siuan’s—the face that had made him back down, softened into youth. “How?” was
all he said. It was almost all he could have managed to say.
“There are some things men are better off not knowing,” Sheriam replied coolly, “and most
women.”
Mara—no, he might as well think of her by her right name—Siuan had been stilled. He knew
that. It must be something to do with stilling. If that swan-necked Domani had been Keeper, he was
ready to wager she had been stilled, too. But talking about stilling around Aes Sedai was a good way
to find out how tough you were. Besides, when they began going mysterious with you, Aes Sedai
would not give a straight answer if you asked whether the sky was blue.
They were very good, these Aes Sedai. They had lulled him, then hit hard when his guard was
down. He had a sinking feeling that he knew what they were softening him for. It would be interesting
to learn whether he was right. “It does not change the oath they took. If they were still Amyrlin and
Keeper, they could be held to that oath by any law, including that of Tar Valon.”
“Since you have no objection to remaining here,” Sheriam said, “you may have Siuan as your
bodyservant, when we do not need her. You may have all three of them, if you wish, including Min,
whom you apparently know as Serenla, all the time.” For some reason, that seemed to irritate Siuan
as much as what had been said about her; she muttered to herself, not loud enough to be heard. “And
since you have no objections, Lord Bryne, while you remain with us there is a service that you can
give us.”
“The gratitude of Aes Sedai is not inconsiderable,” Morvrin said.
“You will be serving the Light and justice in serving us,” Carlinya added.
Beonin nodded, speaking in serious tones. “You served Morgase and Andor faithfully. Serve us
as well, and you will not find exile at its end. Nothing we ask of you will go against your honor.
Nothing we ask will harm Andor.”
Bryne grimaced. He was in the Game, all right. He sometimes thought that Aes Sedai must have
invented Daes Dae’mar; they seemed to play it in their sleep. Battle was surely more bloody, but it
was more honest, too. If they meant to pull his strings, then his strings would be pulled—they would
manage it one way or another—but it was time to show them he was not a brainless puppet.
“The White Tower is broken,” he said flatly. Those Aes Sedai eyes widened, but he gave them
no chance to speak. “The Ajahs have split. That is the only reason you can all be here. You certainly
don’t need an extra sword or two”—he eyed Dromand and got a nod in return—“so the only service
you can want out of me is to lead an army. To build one, first, unless you have other camps with a
good many more men than I saw here. And that means you intend to oppose Elaida.” Sheriam looked
vexed, Anaiya worried, and Carlinya on the point of speaking, but he went on. Let them listen; he
expected he would be doing a great deal of listening to them in the months to come. “Very well. I’ve
never liked Elaida, and I cannot believe she makes a good Amyrlin. More importantly, I can make an
army to take Tar Valon. So long as you know the taking will be bloody and long.
“But these are my conditions.” They stiffened to a woman at that, even Siuan and Leane. Men did
not make conditions for Aes Sedai. “First, the command is mine. You tell me what to do, but I decide
how. You give commands to me, and I give them to the soldiers under me, not you. Not unless I have
agreed to it first.” Several mouths opened, Carlinya’s and Beonin’s first, but he continued. “I assign
men, I promote them, and I discipline them. Not you. Second, if I tell you it can’t be done, you will

consider what I say. I don’t ask to usurp your authority”—small chance they would allow that—“yet I
do not want to waste men because you do not understand war.” It would happen, but no more than
once, if he was lucky. “Third, if you begin this, you will stay the course. I will be putting my head in a
noose, and every man who follows along with me, and should you decide half a year from now that
Elaida as Amyrlin is preferable to war, you will pull that noose tight for every one of us who can be
hunted down. The nations may stay out of a civil war in the Tower, but they’ll not let us live if you
abandon us. Elaida will see to that.
“If you will not agree to these, then I do not know that I can serve you. Whether you bind me with
the Power for Dromand here to slit my throat or I end attainted and hung, death is still the end.”
The Aes Sedai did not speak. For a long moment they stared at him, until the itch between his
shoulder blades made him wonder if Nuhel was ready to plunge a dagger in. Then Sheriam rose, and
the others followed her to the windows. He could see their lips moving, but he heard nothing. If they
wanted to hide their deliberations behind the One Power, so be it. He was not certain how much of
what he wanted he could wring out of them. All, if they were sensible, but Aes Sedai could decide
that strange things were sensible. Whatever they decided, he would have to accede with as good a
grace as he could muster. It was a perfect trap that he had made for himself.
Leane gave him a look and a smile that said as plain as words that he would never know what he
had missed; he thought it would have been a fine chase, with him being led by the nose. Domani
women never promised half what you thought they did, and they gave only as much as they chose and
changed their minds either way in a blink.
The bait in his trap stared at him levelly, strode across the floor until she stood so close that she
had to crane her neck to stare up at him, and spoke in a low, furious voice. “Why did you do this?
Why did you follow us? For a barn?”
“For an oath.” For a pair of blue eyes. Siuan Sanche could not be more than ten years younger
than he, but it was hard to remember that she was Siuan Sanche while looking at a face nearer thirty
years younger. The eyes were the same, though, deep blue and strong. “An oath you gave to me, and
broke. I should double your time for that.”
Dropping her gaze from his, she folded her arms beneath her breasts, growling, “That has
already been taken care of.”
“You mean they punished you for oathbreaking? If you’ve had your bottom switched for it, it
doesn’t count unless I do it.”
Dromand’s chuckle sounded more than half scandalized—the man had to be still struggling with
who Siuan had been; Bryne was not certain that he was not, too—and her face darkened until he
thought she might have apoplexy. “My time has already been doubled, if not more, you pile of rancid
fish guts! You and your marking hours! Not an hour will count until you have all three of us back at
your manor, not if I must be your . . . your . . . dog robber, whatever that is . . . for twenty years!”
So they had planned for this, too, Sheriam and the others. He glanced to their conference by the
windows. They seemed to have divided into two opposing groups; Sheriam, Anaiya and Myrelle on
one side, Morvrin and Carlinya on the other, with Beonin standing between. They had been ready to
give him Siuan and Leane and—Min?—as bribe or sop, before he ever walked in. They were
desperate, which meant he was on the weaker side, but maybe they were desperate enough to give
him what he needed for a chance of victory.
“You are taking pleasure from this, aren’t you?” Siuan said fiercely the moment his eyes moved.
“You buzzard. Burn you for a carp-brained fool. Now that you know who I am, it pleases you that I’ll
have to bow and scrape to you.” She did not seem to be doing much of that yet. “Why? Is it because I

made you back down over Murandy? Are you so small, Gareth Bryne?”
She was trying to make him angry; she realized that she had said too much, and did not want to
give him time to think on it. Maybe she was no longer Aes Sedai, but manipulation was in her blood.
“You were the Amyrlin Seat,” he said calmly, “and even a king kisses the Amyrlin’s ring. I can’t
say that I liked how you went about it, and we may have a quiet talk sometime on whether it was
necessary to do what you did with half the court looking on, but you will remember that I followed
Mara Tomanes here, and it was Mara Tomanes I asked for. Not Siuan Sanche. Since you keep asking
why, let me ask it. Why was it so important for me to allow the Murandians to raid across the
border?”
“Because your interference then could have ruined important plans,” she said, driving each word
home in a tight voice, “just as your interference with me now can. The Tower had identified a young
border lord named Dulain as a man who could one day truly unify Murandy, with our help. I could
hardly allow the chance your soldiers might kill him. I have work to do here, Lord Bryne. Leave me
to do it, and you may see victory. Meddle out of spite, and you ruin everything.”
“Whatever your work is, I am sure Sheriam and the others will see you do it. Dulain? I’ve never
heard of him. He cannot be succeeding yet.” It was his opinion that Murandy would remain a
patchwork of all but independent lords and ladies until the Wheel turned and a new Age came.
Murandians called themselves Lugarders or Mindeans or whatever before they named a nation. If they
even bothered to name one. A lord who could unite them, and who had Siuan’s leash around his
throat, could bring a considerable number of men.
“He . . . died.” Scarlet spots appeared in her cheeks, and she seemed to struggle with herself. “A
month after I left Caemlyn,” she muttered, “some Andoran farmer put an arrow through him on a sheep
raid.”
He could not help laughing. “It was the farmers you should have made kneel, not me. Well, you
no longer need concern yourself with such things.” That was certainly true. Whatever use the Aes
Sedai had for her, they would never let her near power or decisions again now. He felt pity for her.
He could not imagine this woman giving up and dying, but she had lost about as much as it was
possible to lose short of dying. On the other hand, he had not liked being called a buzzard, or a pile of
reeking fish guts. What was the other thing? A carp-brained fool. “From now on, you can concern
yourself with keeping my boots clean and my bed made.”
Her eyes narrowed to slits. “If that is what you want, Lord Gareth Bryne, you should choose
Leane. She might be fool enough.”
Only barely did he stop himself from goggling. The way women’s minds worked never ceased to
amaze him. “You vowed to serve me however I choose.” He managed to chuckle. Why was he doing
this? He knew who she was, and what she was. But those eyes still haunted him, staring a challenge
even when she thought there was no hope, just as they were now. “You will discover the kind of man
I am, Siuan.” He meant it to soothe her after his jest, but from the way her shoulders stiffened, she
seemed to take it as a threat.
Suddenly he realized that he could hear the Aes Sedai, a soft murmur of voices that went silent
immediately. They stood together, staring at him with unreadable expressions. No, at Siuan. Their
eyes followed her as she started back to where Leane still stood; as if she could feel the pressure of
them, each step came a little quicker than the one before. When she turned again, beside the fireplace,
her face told no more than theirs. A remarkable woman. He was not sure he could have done as well,
in her place.
The Aes Sedai were waiting for him to approach. When he did, Sheriam said, “We accept your

conditions without reservation, Lord Bryne, and pledge ourselves to hold to them. They are most
reasonable.”
Carlinya, at least, did not look as though she thought they were reasonable at all, but he did not
care. He had been prepared to give up all but the last, that they stay the course, if need be.
He knelt where he was, right fist pressed to the scrap of carpet, and they encircled him, each
laying a hand on his bowed head. He did not care whether they used the Power to bind him to his oath
or search for truth—he was not sure they could do either, but who really knew what Aes Sedai could
do?—and if they meant something else, there was nothing he could do about it. Trapped by a pair of
eyes, like a bullgoose fool country boy. He was carp-brained. “I do pledge and vow that I will serve
you faithfully until the White Tower is yours . . .”
Already, he was planning. Thad and maybe a Warder or two across the river to see what the
Whitecloaks were up to. Joni, Barim and a few others down to Ebou Dar; it would keep Joni from
swallowing his tongue every
time he looked at “Mara” and “Amaena,” and every man he sent would know how to recruit.
“. . . building and directing your army to the best of my ability. . . .”
When the low buzz of talk in the common room died, Min looked up from the patterns she had
been idly sketching on the table with a finger dipped in wine. Logain stirred, too, for a wonder, but
only to stare at the people in the room, or maybe through them; it was hard to tell.
Gareth Bryne and that big Illianer Warder came out of the back room first. In the watchful
silence, she heard Bryne say, “Tell them an Ebou Dari tavern maid sent you, or they’ll put your head
on a stake.”
The Illianer roared with laughter. “A dangerous city, Ebou Dar.” Pulling leather gauntlets from
behind his sword belt, he stalked out into the street drawing them on.
The talk began to pick up again as Siuan appeared. Min could not hear what Bryne said to her,
but she strode after the Warder snarling to herself. Min had a sinking feeling that the Aes Sedai had
decided that they were going to honor that fool oath Siuan had been so proud of, honor it right now. If
she could convince herself that the pair of Warders lounging against the wall would not notice, she
would be out of the door and into Wildrose’s saddle in a flash.
Sheriam and the other Aes Sedai came out last, with Leane. Myrelle sat Leane down at one of
the tables and began discussing something, while the rest circulated through the room, stopping to
speak to each Aes Sedai. Whatever they said, it produced reactions from outright shock to pleased
grins, despite that fabled Aes Sedai serenity.
“Stay here,” Min told Logain, scraping back her rickety chair. She hoped he was not going to
start trouble. He was staring at Aes Sedai faces, one by one, and appearing to see more than he had in
days. “Just stay at this table till I get back, Dalyn.” She was out of the habit of being around people
who knew his real name. “Please.”
“She sold me to Aes Sedai.” It was a shock to hear him speak after being so long silent. He
shivered, then nodded. “I will wait.”
Min hesitated, but if two Warders could not stop him from doing anything stupid, a roomful of
Aes Sedai certainly could. When she reached the door, a chunky bay gelding was being led away by a
man with the look of a groom. Bryne’s horse, she supposed. Their own mounts were nowhere in sight.
So much for any dash for freedom. I’ll honor the bloody thing! I will! But they can’t keep me from
Rand now. I’ve done what Siuan wanted. They have to let me go to him. The only problem was that
Aes Sedai decided for themselves what they had to do, and usually what other people had to do as

well.
Siuan nearly knocked her down, bustling back in with a scowl on her face, a blanket roll under
her arm and saddlebags over her shoulder. “Watch Logain,” she hissed under her breath without
slowing. “Let no one talk to him.” She marched to the foot of the stairs, where a gray-haired woman, a
servant, was starting to lead Bryne up, and fell in behind. From the stare she fixed on the man’s back,
he should have been praying she did not reach for her belt knife.
Min smiled at the tall, slender Warder who had followed her to the door. He stood ten feet
away, barely glancing at her, but she had no illusions. “We’re guests now. Friends.” He did not return
the smile. Bloody stone-faced men! Why could they not at least give you a hint what they were
thinking?
Logain was still studying the Aes Sedai when she got back to the table. A fine time for Siuan to
want him kept silent, just when he was beginning to show life again. She needed to talk to Siuan.
“Logain,” she said softly, hoping neither of the Warders lounging against the wall could hear. They
had hardly seemed to breathe since taking their positions, except when one had followed her. “I don’t
think you should say anything until Mara tells you what she has planned. Not to anyone.”
“Mara?” He gave her a dark sneer. “You mean Siuan Sanche?” So he remembered what he had
heard in his daze. “Does anyone here look as if they want to talk to me?” He returned to his frowning
study.
No one did look as if they wanted to talk with a gentled false Dragon. Except for the two
Warders, no one seemed to be paying them any mind at all. If she had not known better, she would
have said the Aes Sedai in the room were excited. They had hardly appeared lethargic before, but
they certainly seemed to have more energy now, talking in small groups, issuing brisk orders to
Warders. The papers they had been so intent on largely lay abandoned. Sheriam and the others who
had taken Siuan away had returned to the room at the back, but Leane had two clerks at her table now,
both women writing as fast as they could. And a steady stream of Aes Sedai were coming into the inn,
disappearing through that rough plank door and not coming out. Whatever had happened in there,
Siuan had surely stirred them up.
Min wished she had Siuan at the table, or better yet somewhere alone, for five minutes.
Doubtless at that moment she was beating Bryne over the head with his saddlebags. No, Siuan would
not resort to that, for all of her glares. Bryne was not like Logain, larger than life in every dimension,
every emotion; Logain had managed to overpower Siuan for a time with sheer hugeness. Bryne was
quiet, reserved, not a small man certainly, but hardly overbearing. She would not want the man she
remembered from Kore Springs as an enemy, but she did not think that he would hold out long against
Siuan. He might think she was going to meekly serve out her time as his servant, but Min had no
doubts who would end doing what who wanted. She just had to talk to the woman about him.
As if Min’s thoughts had brought her, Siuan came stumping down the stairs, a bundle of white
under her arm. Stalked down was nearer truth; if she had had a tail, she would have been lashing it.
She paused for one instant, staring at Min and Logain, then marched toward the door that led to the
kitchens.
“Stay here,” Min cautioned Logain. “And please, say nothing until . . . Siuan can talk to you.”
She was going to have to get used to calling people by their right names again. He did not even look
at her.
She caught up with Siuan in a hallway short of the kitchen; the rattle and splash of pots being
scrubbed and dishes washed drifted through gaps where boards had dried in the kitchen door.
Siuan’s eyes widened in alarm. “Why did you leave him? Is he still alive?”

“He’ll live forever, for all I can see. Siuan, no one wants to talk to him. But I have to talk with
you.” Siuan stuffed the white bundle into her arms. Shirts. “What is this?”
“Gareth bloody Bryne’s bloody laundry,” the other woman snarled. “Since you are one of his
serving girls, too, you can wash them. I must speak with Logain before anyone else.”
Min caught her arm as she tried to brush past. “You can spare one minute to listen. When Bryne
came in, I had a viewing. An aura, and a bull ripping roses from around its neck, and . . . None of it
matters except the aura. I didn’t even really understand that, but more than anything else.”
“How much did you understand?”
“If you want to stay alive, you had better stay close to him.” Despite the heat, Min shivered. She
had only ever had one other viewing with an “if” in it, and both had been potentially deadly. It was
bad enough sometimes knowing what would happen; if she started knowing what might . . . “All I
know is this. If he stays close to you, you live. If he gets too far away, for too long, you are going to
die. Both of you. I don’t know why I should have seen anything about you in his aura, but you seemed
like part of it.”
Siuan’s smile would have done to peel a pear. “I’d as soon sail in a rotting hull full of last
month’s eels.”
“I never thought he’d follow us. Are they really going to make us go with him?”
“Oh, no, Min. He is going to lead our armies to victory. And make my life the Pit of Doom! So
he’s going to save my life, is he? I don’t know that it is worth it.” Taking a deep breath, she smoothed
her skirts. “When you have those washed and ironed, bring them to me. I will take them up to him.
You can clean his boots before you go to sleep tonight. We have a room—a cubbyhole—near him, so
we will be close if he calls to have his bloody pillows plumped!” She was gone before Min could
protest.
Staring down at the wadded shirts, Min was sure that she knew who was going to be doing all of
Gareth Bryne’s laundry, and it was not Siuan Sanche. Rand bloody al’Thor. Fall in love with a man,
and you ended up doing laundry, even if it did belong to another man. When she marched into the
kitchen to demand a washtub and hot water, she was snarling every bit as much as Siuan.

CHAPTER

Memories of Saldaea

Lying on his bed in the dark, in his shirtsleeves, Kadere idly twirled one of his large kerchiefs
between his hands. The wagon’s open windows let in moonlight, but not much breeze. At least
Cairhien was cooler than the Waste. Someday he hoped to return to Saldaea, to walk in the garden
where his sister Teodora had taught him his first letters and numbers. He missed her as much as he
did Saldaea, the deep winters when trees burst from their sap freezing and the only way to travel was
by snowshoes or skis. In these southlands, spring felt like summer, and summer like the Pit of Doom.
Sweat rolled out of him in streams.
With a heavy sigh, he pushed his fingers into a small gap where the bed was built into the
wagon. The folded scrap of parchment rustled. He left it there. He knew the words on it by heart.
You are not alone among strangers. A way has been chosen.
Just that, without signature, of course. He had found it slipped under his door when he retired for
the night. There was a town not a quarter of a mile away, Eianrod, but even if a soft bed remained
empty there, he doubted whether the Aiel would allow him to spend a night away from the wagons.
Or that the Aes Sedai would. For the moment, his plans fit in well enough with Moiraine’s. Perhaps
he would get to see Tar Valon again. A dangerous place, for his sort, but the work there was always
important, and invigorating.
He put his mind back on the note, though he wished he could afford to ignore it. The word
“chosen” made him sure it came from another Darkfriend. The first surprise had been receiving it
now, after crossing most of Cairhien. Nearly two months ago, right after Jasin Natael attached himself
to Rand al’Thor—for reasons the man had never deigned to explain—and his new partner Keille
Shaogi had disappeared—he suspected she was buried in the Waste, with a thrust from Natael’s knife
through her heart, and small riddance—soon after that, he had been visited by one of the Chosen. By
Lanfear herself. She had given him his instructions.
Automatically his hand went to his chest, feeling through his shirt the scars branded there. He
mopped his face with the kerchief. Part of his mind thought coldly, as it had at least once a day since,
that they were an effective way to prove to him that it had not been an ordinary dream. An ordinary
nightmare. Another part of him almost gibbered with relief that she had not returned.
The second surprise of the note had been the hand. A woman’s hand, unless he missed his guess
by a mile, and some of the letters formed in what he now knew for an Aiel way. Natael had told him
that there must be Darkfriends among the Aiel—there were Darkfriends in every land, among every
people—but he had never wanted to find brothers in the Waste. Aiel would kill you as soon as look at
you, and you could put a foot wrong with them by breathing.
Taken all in all, the note spelled disaster. Possibly Natael had told some Aiel Darkfriend who
he was. Angrily twirling the kerchief to a long thin cord, he snapped it tight between his hands. If the

gleeman and Keille had not had proofs that they stood high in Darkfriend councils, he would have
killed them both before going near the Waste. The only other possibility made his stomach leaden. “A
way has been chosen.” Maybe that had only been to put the word “chosen” down, and maybe it was
meant to tell him that one of the Chosen had decided to use him. The note had not come from Lanfear;
she would simply have spoken to him in his dreams once more.
In spite of the heat, he shivered, yet he had to wipe his face again, too. He had the feeling that
Lanfear was a jealous mistress to serve, but if another of the Chosen wanted him he would have no
choice. Despite all the promises made when he had given his oaths as a boy, he was a man of few
illusions. Caught between two of the Chosen, he could be flattened like a kitten beneath a wagon
wheel, and they would notice as much as the wagon did. He wished he were home in Saldaea. He
wished he could see Teodora again.
A scraping at the door brought him to his feet; for all his bulk, he was more agile than he let
anyone see. Mopping his face and neck, he made his way past the brick stove that he certainly had no
need for here, and the cabinets with their ornately carved and painted uprights. When he pulled the
door open, a slender figure swathed in black robes scurried in past him. He took one quick look
around the moonlit darkness to make certain no one was watching—the drivers were all snoring
beneath the other wagons and the Aiel guards never came among the wagons themselves—and quickly
shut the door again.
“You must be hot, Isendre,” he chuckled. “Take off that robe and make yourself comfortable.”
“Thank you, no,” she said bitterly from the shadowed depths of her cowl. She stood stiffly, but
every now and then she twitched; the wool must be even itchier than usual tonight.
He chuckled again. “As you wish.” Beneath those robes, he suspected, the Maidens of the Spear
still allowed her to wear nothing but the stolen jewelry, if that. She had become prudish in ways,
since the Maidens had her. Why the woman had been stupid enough to steal, he could not understand.
He had certainly made no objections when they dragged her screaming from the wagon by her hair; he
was only glad that they had not thought he was involved. Her greediness had certainly made his task
more difficult. “Have you anything to report on al’Thor or Natael?” A major part of Lanfear’s
instruction had been to keep a close eye on those two, and he knew no better way to keep an eye on a
man than to put a woman in his bed. Any man told his bedmate things he had vowed to keep secret,
boasted of his plans, revealed his weaknesses, even if he was the Dragon Reborn and this Dawn
fellow the Aiel called him.
She shuddered visibly. “At least I can come near Natael.” Come near him? Once the Maidens
had caught her sneaking to the man’s tent, they had practically begun stuffing her into it every night.
She always put the best face on matters. “Not that he tells me anything. Wait. Be patient. Keep silent.
Make accommodation with fate, whatever that means. He says that every time I try to ask a question.
For the most part, all he wants to do is play music I’ve never heard before and make love.” She never
had anything more to say about the gleeman. For the hundredth time he wondered why Lanfear wanted
Natael watched. The man was supposed to be as high as a Darkfriend could reach, only a step below
the Chosen themselves.
“I take it that means you still have not managed to wriggle into al’Thor’s bed?” he asked,
brushing past her to sit down on the bed.
“No.” She writhed uncomfortably.
“Then you will have to try harder, won’t you? I am growing tired of failure, Isendre, and our
masters are not as patient as I. He’s only a man, whatever his titles.” She had often boasted to him that
she could have any man she wanted, and make him do whatever she wanted. She had shown him the

truth of her boasts. She had not needed to steal jewelry; he would have bought her anything she
wanted. He had bought her more than he could afford. “The bloody Maidens can’t watch him every
second, and once you are in his bed, he’ll not let them harm you.” One taste of her would be enough
for that. “I have full faith and confidence in your abilities.”
“No.” If anything, the word was shorter this time.
He rolled and unrolled the kerchief irritably. “ ‘No’ is not a word our masters like to hear,
Isendre.” That meant their lords among the Darkfriends; not all lords or ladies by any means—a
groom might give orders to a lady, a beggar to a magistrate—but their commands were at least as
strictly enforced as any noble’s, and usually more so. “Not a word our mistress will like to hear.”
Isendre shuddered. She had not believed his tale until he showed her the burns on his chest, but
since then, one mention of Lanfear had been enough to quell any rebellion on her part. This time, she
began to weep.
“I cannot, Hadnan. When we stopped tonight, I thought I might have a chance in a town instead of
tents, but they caught me before I got within ten paces of him.” She pushed back her hood, and he
gaped as moonlight played over her bare scalp. Even her eyebrows were gone. “They shaved me,
Hadnan. Adelin and Enaila and Jolien, they held me down and shaved every hair. They beat me with
nettles, Hadnan.” She shook like a sapling in high wind, sobbing slack-mouthed and mumbling the
words. “I itch from shoulders to knees, and I burn too much to scratch. They said they’d make me
wear nettles, the next time I so much as looked in his direction. They meant it, Hadnan. They did!
They said they’d give me to Aviendha, and they told me what she would do. I cannot, Hadnan. Not
again. I cannot.”
Stunned, he stared at her. She had had such lovely dark hair. Yet she was beautiful enough that
even being bald as an egg only made her seem exotic. Her tears and sagging face detracted only a
little. If she could put herself into al’Thor’s bed for just one night . . . It was not going to happen. The
Maidens had broken her. He had broken people himself, and he knew the signs. Eagerness to avoid
more punishment became eagerness to obey. The mind never wanted to admit it was running from
something, so she would soon convince herself that she really wanted to obey, that she really wanted
nothing more than to please the Maidens.
“What does Aviendha have to do with it?” he muttered. How soon before Isendre felt the need to
confess her sins, as well?
“Al’Thor has been bedding her since Rhuidean, you fool! She spends every night with him. The
Maidens think she will marry him.” Even through her sobs he could detect resentful fury. She would
not like it that another had succeeded where she failed. Doubtless that was why she had not told him
before.
Aviendha was a beautiful woman despite her fierce eyes, full-breasted compared to most of the
Maidens, yet he would stack Isendre against her if only . . . Isendre slumped in the moonlight coming
through the windows, quivering from head to toe, sobbing openmouthed, tears rolling down her
cheeks that she did not even bother to wipe away. She would grovel on the ground if Aviendha
frowned at her.
“Very well,” he said gently. “If you cannot, then you cannot. You can still pry something out of
Natael. I know you can.” Rising, he took her shoulders to turn her toward the door.
She flinched away from his touch, but she did turn. “Natael will not want to look at me for
days,” she said petulantly around hiccoughs and sniffs. Sobs threatened to break out again any
moment, but his tone seemed to have soothed her. “I’m red, Hadnan. As red as if I had laid naked in
the sun for a day. And my hair. It will take forever to grow ba—”

As she reached for the door, her eyes going to the handle, he had the kerchief spun to a cord in an
instant and around her neck. He tried to ignore her rasping gurgles, the frantic scraping of her feet on
the floor. Her fingers clawed at his hands, but he stared straight ahead. Even keeping his eyes open,
he saw Teodora; he always did, when he killed a woman. He had loved his sister, but she had
discovered what he was, and she would not have kept silent. Isendre’s heels drummed violently, but
after what seemed an eternity they slowed, went still, and she became a dead weight dragging at his
hands. He held the cord tight for a count of sixty before unwinding it and letting her fall. She would
have been confessing, next. Confessing to being a Darkfriend. Pointing a finger at him.
Rummaging in the cabinets by touch, he pulled out a butchering knife. Disposing of a whole
corpse would be difficult, but luckily the dead did not bleed much; the robe would absorb what little
there was. Maybe he could find the woman who had left the note under his door. If she was not pretty
enough, she must have friends who were also Darkfriends. Natael would not care if it was an Aiel
woman who visited him—Kadere would rather have bedded a viper himself; Aiel were dangerous—
and maybe an Aiel would have a better chance than Isendre against Aviendha. Kneeling, he hummed
quietly to himself as he worked, a lullaby that Teodora had taught him.

A Wager

A soft night breeze stirred across the small town of Eianrod, then faded. Sitting on the stone
rail of the wide flat bridge in the heart of the town, Rand supposed the breeze was hot, yet it hardly
felt so after the Waste. Warm for nighttime perhaps, but not enough to make him unbutton his red coat.
The river below him had never been large, and was half its normal width now, yet he still enjoyed
watching the water flow north, moonshadows cast by scudding clouds playing across the darkly
glittering surface. That was why he was out here in the night, really; to look at running water for a
time. His wards were set, surrounding the Aiel encampment that itself surrounded the town. The Aiel
themselves kept a watch a sparrow could not pierce unseen. He could waste an hour being soothed by
the flow of a river.
It was surely better than another night where he had to order Moiraine to leave so he could study
with Asmodean. She had even taken to bringing his meals to him and talking while he ate, as if she
meant to cram everything she knew into his head before they reached the city of Cairhien. He could
not face her begging to remain—actually begging!—as she had the previous night. For a woman like
Moiraine, that behavior was so unnatural that he had wanted to agree simply to stop it. Which was
very likely why she had done it. Much better an hour listening to the quiet liquid ripplings of the river.
With luck, she would have given up on him for tonight.
The eight or ten paces of clay between water and weeds on both sides below him was dried and
cracked. He peered up at the clouds crossing the moon. He could try to make those clouds give rain.
The town’s two fountains were both dry, and dust lay in a third of the wells not fouled beyond
cleaning. Try was the word, though. He had made it rain once; remembering how was the trick. If he
managed that, then he could try not to make it a drowning deluge and a tree-snapping windstorm this
time.
Asmodean would be no help; he did not know much about weather, it seemed. For every thing
the man taught him, there were two more that made Asmodean either throw up his hands or give a lick
and a promise. Once he had thought that the Forsaken knew everything, that they were all but
omnipotent. But if the others were like Asmodean, they had ignorances as well as weaknesses. It
might actually be that he already knew more of some things than they. Than some of them, at least. The
problem would be finding out who. Semirhage was almost as poor at handling weather as Asmodean.
He shivered as if this were night in the Three-fold Land. Asmodean had never told him that.
Better to listen to the water and not think, if he meant to sleep at all tonight.
Sulin approached him, the shoufa around her shoulders so it uncovered her short white hair, and
leaned on the railing. The wiry Maiden was armed for battle, bow and arrows, spears and knife and
buckler. She had taken command of his bodyguard tonight. Two dozen more Far Dareis Mai squatted
easily on the bridge ten paces away. “An odd night,” she said. “We were gambling, but suddenly

everyone was throwing nothing but sixes.”
“I am sorry,” he told her without thinking, and she gave him a peculiar look. She did not know,
of course; he had not spread it about. The ripples he gave off as ta’veren spread out in odd, random
ways. Even the Aiel would not want to be within ten miles of him, if they knew.
The ground had given way beneath three Stone Dogs today, dropping them into a viper pit, but
none of the dozens of bites had found anything but cloth. He knew that had been him, bending chance.
Tal Nethin, the saddlemaker, had survived Taien to trip on a stone this very noon and break his neck
falling on flat, grassy ground. Rand was afraid that had been him, too. On the other hand, Bael and
Jheran had mended the blood feud between Shaarad and Goshien while he was with them, eating a
midday meal of dried meat on the move. They still did not like each other, and hardly seemed to
understand what they had done, but it was done, with pledges and water oaths given, each man
holding the cup for the other to drink. To Aiel, water oaths were stronger than any other; it might be
generations before Shaarad and Goshien so much as raided each other for sheep or goats or cattle.
He had wondered if those random effects would ever work in his favor; maybe this was as close
as it came. What else had happened today that might be laid at his feet, he did not know; he never
asked, and would as soon not hear. The Baels and Jherans could only partly make up for the Tal
Nethins.
“I’ve not seen Enaila or Adelin for days,” he said. It was as good a change of subject as any.
That pair in particular had seemed to be jealous of their places guarding him. “Are they ill?”
If anything, the look Sulin gave him was even more peculiar. “They will return when they learn
to stop playing with dolls, Rand al’Thor.”
He opened his mouth, then closed it again. Aiel were strange—Aviendha’s lessons often made
them more so, not less—but this was ridiculous. “Well, tell them they are grown women and they
ought to act it.”
Even by moonlight he could tell that her smile was pleased. “It shall be as the Car’a’carn
wishes.” What did that mean? She eyed him a moment, lips pursed thoughtfully. “You have not eaten
yet tonight. There is still enough food for everyone, and you will not fill one belly by going hungry
yourself. If you do not eat, people will worry that you are ill. You will become ill.”
He laughed softly, a hoarse wheeze. The Car’a’carn one minute, and the next . . . If he did not
fetch something to eat, Sulin would probably go get it for him. And try to feed him to boot. “I will eat.
Moiraine must be in her blankets by now.” This time her odd look was satisfying; for a change he had
said something that she did not understand.
As he swung his feet down, he heard the ring of horses’ hooves walking down the stone-paved
street toward the bridge. Every Maiden was upright in an instant, face veiled; half nocked arrows.
His hand went to his waist by instinct, but the sword was not there. The Aiel felt strange enough about
him riding a horse and carrying the thing at his saddle; he had not seen any need to offend their
customs more by wearing it. Besides, there were not many horses, and they were coming at a walk.
When they appeared, surrounded by an escort of fifty Aiel, the riders numbered fewer than
twenty, slumping in their saddles dejectedly. Most wore rimmed helmets and Tairen coats with puffy,
striped sleeves beneath their breastplates. The pair in the lead had ornately gilded cuirasses, and
large white plumes attached to the front of their helmets, and the stripes on their sleeves had the
glisten of satin in the moonlight. Half a dozen men at the rear, though, shorter and slighter than the
Tairens, two with small banners called con on short staffs harnessed to their backs, wore dark coats
and helmets shaped like bells cut away to expose their faces. Cairhienin used the banners to pick out
officers in battle, and also to mark a lord’s personal retainers.

The Tairens with plumes stared when they saw him, exchanged startled glances, then scrambled
down to come kneel before him, helmets under their arms. They were young, little older than he, both
with dark beards trimmed to neat points in the fashion of Tairen nobility. Dents marred their
breastplates, and the gilding was chipped; they had been crossing swords somewhere. Neither as
much as glanced at the Aiel surrounding them, as if when ignored they would disappear. The Maidens
unveiled, though they looked no less ready to put spear or arrow through the kneeling men.
Rhuarc followed the Tairens, with a gray-eyed Aiel younger and slightly taller than he, and
stood behind. Mangin was of the Jindo Taardad, and one of those who had gone to the Stone of Tear.
Jindo had brought in the riders.
“My Lord Dragon,” the plump, pink-cheeked lordling said, “burn my soul, but have they taken
you prisoner?” His companion, jug ears and potato nose making him look a farmer despite his beard,
kept sweeping lanky hair from his forehead nervously. “They said they were taking us to some Dawn
fellow. The Car’a’carn. Means something about chiefs, if I remember what my tutor said. Forgive
me, my Lord Dragon. I am Edorion of House Selorna, and this is Estean of House Andiama.”
“I am He Who Comes With the Dawn,” Rand told them quietly. “And theCar’a’carn.” He had
them placed now: young lords who had spent their time drinking, gambling and chasing women when
he was in the Stone. Estean’s eyes nearly popped out of his face; Edorion looked as surprised for a
moment, then nodded slowly, as if he suddenly saw how it made sense. “Stand. Who are your
Cairhienin companions?” It would be interesting to meet Cairhienin who were not running for their
lives from the Shaido, and any other Aiel they saw. For that matter, if they were with Edorion and
Estean, they might be the first supporters he had met in this land. If the two Tairens’ fathers had
followed his orders. “Bring them forward.”
Estean blinked in surprise as he rose, but Edorion barely paused in turning to shout, “Meresin!
Daricain! Come here!” Much like calling dogs. The Cairhienins’ banners bobbed as they dismounted
slowly.
“My Lord Dragon.” Estean hesitated, licking his lips as though thirsty. “Did you . . . Did you
send the Aiel against Cairhien?”
“They’ve attacked the city, then?”
Rhuarc nodded, and Mangin said, “If these are to be believed, Cairhien still holds. Or did three
days ago.” There was little doubt that he did not think it still did, and less that he cared about a city of
treekillers.
“I did not send them, Estean,” Rand said as they were joined by the two Cairhienin, who knelt,
doffing their helmets to reveal men of an age with Edorion and Estean, their hair shaved back in line
with their ears and their dark eyes wary. “Those who attack the city are my enemies, the Shaido. I
mean to save Cairhien if it can be saved.”
He had to go through the business of telling the Cairhienin to rise; his time with the Aiel had
almost made him forget the habit this side of the Spine of the World, bowing and kneeling right and
left. He had to ask for introductions, too, and the Cairhienin gave them themselves. Lieutenant Lord
Meresin of House Daganred—his con was all wavy vertical lines of red and white—and Lieutenant
Lord Daricain of House Annallin, his con covered with small squares of red and black. It was a
surprise that they were lords. Though lords commanded and led soldiers in Cairhien, they did not
shave their heads and become soldiers. Or had not; much had changed, apparently.
“My Lord Dragon.” Meresin stumbled a bit saying that. He and Daricain were both pale, slender
men, with narrow faces and long noses, but he was a bit the heavier. Neither looked as if he had had
much to eat lately. Meresin rushed on as if afraid of being interrupted. “My Lord Dragon, Cairhien

can hold. For days yet, perhaps as many as ten or twelve, but you must come quickly if you are to
save it.”
“That is why we came out,” Estean said, shooting Meresin a dark look. Both Cairhienin returned
it, but their defiance was tinged with resignation. Estean raked stringy hair from his forehead. “To
find help. Parties have been sent in every direction, my Lord Dragon.” He shivered despite the sweat
on his brow, and his voice turned distant and hollow. “There were more of us when we started. I saw
Baran go down, screaming with a spear through his guts. He’ll never turn a card at chop again. I could
use a mug of strong brandy.”
Edorion turned his helmet in gauntleted hands, frowning. “My Lord Dragon, the city can hold a
while longer, but even if these Aiel will fight those, the question is, can you bring them there in time?
I think ten or twelve days is a more than generous estimate, myself. In truth, I only came because I
thought dying with a spear through me would be better than being taken alive when they made it over
the walls. The city is packed with refugees who fled ahead of the Aiel; there isn’t a dog or a pigeon
left in the city, and I doubt there will be a rat left soon. The one good thing is that no one seems to be
worrying very much about who will take the Sun Throne, not with this Couladin outside.”
“He called on us to surrender to He Who Comes With the Dawn, on the second day,” Daricain
put in, earning a sharp look from Edorion for the interruption.
“Couladin has some sport with prisoners,” Estean said. “Out of bowshot, but where anyone on
the walls can see. You can hear them screaming, too. The Light burn my soul, I don’t know whether he
is trying to break our will or simply likes it. Sometimes they let peasants make a run for the city, then
shoot them full of arrows when they’re almost safe. However safe Cairhien is. Only peasants, but
. . .” He trailed off and swallowed hard, as if he had just remembered what Rand’s opinions were of
“only peasants.” Rand just looked at him, but he seemed to shrivel, and muttered under his breath
about brandy.
Edorion leaped into the momentary silence. “My Lord Dragon, the point is that the city can hold
until you come, if you can come quickly. We only beat back the first assault because the Foregate
caught fire. . . .”
“Flames nearly took the city,” Estean interjected. The Foregate, a city in itself outside the walls
of Cairhien, had been mostly wood, as Rand remembered. “Would have been disaster if the river was
not right there.”
The other Tairen went on right over him. “. . . but Lord Meilan has the defense well planned, and
the Cairhienin appear to be keeping their backbones for the time.” That earned him frowns from
Meresin and Daricain that he either did not see or pretended not to. “Seven days with luck, perhaps
eight at most. If you can . . .” A heavy sigh abruptly seemed to deflate Edorion’s plumpness. “I did not
see one horse,” he said as if to himself. “The Aiel do not ride. You will never be able to move men
afoot so far in time.”
“How long?” Rand asked Rhuarc.
“Seven days” was the reply. Mangin nodded, and Estean laughed.
“Burn my soul, it took us as long to reach here on horses. If you think you can make the return in
the same afoot, you must be . . .” Becoming aware of the Aiel eyes on him, Estean scrubbed the hair
from his face. “Is there any brandy in this town?” he muttered.
“It isn’t how fast we can make it,” Rand said quietly, “but how fast you can, if you dismount
some of your men and use their horses for spares. I want to let Meilan and Cairhien know that help is
on the way. But whoever goes will have to be sure he can keep his mouth shut if the Shaido take him.
I do not intend to let Couladin know any more than he can learn on his own.” Estean went whiter in

the face than the Cairhienin.
Meresin and Daricain were on their knees together, each seizing one of Rand’s hands to kiss. He
let them, with as much patience as he could find; one bit of Moiraine’s advice that had the ring of
common sense was not to offend people’s customs, however strange or even repulsive, unless you
absolutely had to, and even then think twice.
“We will go, my Lord Dragon,” Meresin said breathlessly. “Thank you, my Lord Dragon. Thank
you. Under the Light, I vow I will die before revealing a word to any but my father or the High Lord
Meilan.”
“Grace favor you, my Lord Dragon,” the other added. “Grace favor you, and the Light illumine
you forever. I am your man to the death.” Rand let Meresin say that he also was Rand’s man before
taking his hands back firmly and telling them to stand. He did not like the way they were looking at
him. Edorion had called them like hounds, but men should not look at anyone as if they were dogs
gazing at a master.
Edorion drew a deep breath, puffing his pink cheeks, and let it out slowly. “I suppose if I made it
out in one piece, I can make it back in. My Lord Dragon, forgive me if I offend, but would you care to
wager, say, a thousand gold crowns, that you can really come in seven days?”
Rand stared at him. The man was as bad as Mat. “I don’t have a hundred crowns silver, much
less a thousand in—”
Sulin broke in. “He has it, Tairen,” she said firmly. “He will meet your wager, if you make it ten
thousand by weight.”
Edorion laughed. “Done, Aiel. And worth every copper if I lose. Come to think, I’ll not live to
collect if I win. Come, Meresin, Daricain.” It sounded as if he were summoning dogs to heel. “We
ride.”
Rand waited until the three had made their bows and were halfway back to the horses before
rounding on the white-haired Maiden. “What do you mean, I have a thousand gold crowns? I’ve never
seen a thousand crowns, much less ten thousand.”
The Maidens exchanged glances as if he were demented; so did Rhuarc and Mangin. “A fifth of
the treasure that was in the Stone of Tear belongs to those who took the Stone, and will be claimed
when they can carry it away.” Sulin spoke as to a child, instructing it in the simple facts of everyday
life. “As chief and battle leader there, one tenth of that fifth is yours. Tear submitted to you as chief by
right of triumph, so one tenth of Tear is yours as well. And you have said we can take the fifth in these
lands—a . . . tax, you called it.” She fumbled the word; the Aiel did not have taxes. “The tenth part of
that is yours also, as Car’a’carn.”
Rand shook his head. In all of his talks with Aviendha, he had never thought to ask whether the
fifth applied to him; he was not Aiel, Car’a’carn or no, and it had not seemed anything to do with
him. Well, it might not be a tax, but he could use it as kings did taxes. Unfortunately, he had only the
vaguest idea how that was. He would have to ask Moiraine; that was one thing she had missed in her
lectures. Perhaps she thought it so obvious that he should know.
Elayne would have known what taxes were used for; it had certainly been more fun taking
advice from her than from Moiraine. He wished he knew where she was. Still in Tanchico, probably;
Egwene told him little more than a constant string of well-wishings. He wished he could sit Elayne
down and make her explain those two letters. Maiden of the Spear or Daughter-Heir of Andor,
women were strange. Except maybe Min. She had laughed at him, but she had never made him think
she was speaking some strange language. She would not laugh, now. If he ever saw her again, she
would run a hundred miles to get away from the Dragon Reborn.

Edorion dismounted all his men, taking one of their horses and stringing the others together by
their reins, along with Estean’s. No doubt he was saving his own for the final sprint through the
Shaido. Merisin and Daricain did the same with their men. Though it meant that the Cairhienin had
only two spare mounts apiece, no one seemed to think they should have any of the Tairen horses. They
clattered off together westward at a trot, with a Jindo escort.
Carefully not looking at anyone, Estean started to drift toward the soldiers standing uneasily in a
circle of Aiel at the foot of the bridge. Mangin caught his red-striped sleeve. “You can tell us
conditions inside Cairhien, wetlander.” The lumpy-faced man looked ready to faint.
“I am certain he will answer any questions you ask,” Rand said sharply, emphasizing the final
word.
“They will only be asked,” Rhuarc said, taking the Tairen’s other arm. He and Mangin seemed to
be holding the much shorter man up between them. “Warning the city’s defenders is well and good,
Rand al’Thor,” Rhuarc went on, “but we should send scouts. Running, they can reach Cairhien as
soon as those men on horses, and meet us coming back with word of how Couladin has disposed the
Shaido.”
Rand could feel the Maidens’ eyes on him, but he looked straight at Rhuarc. “Thunder Walkers?”
he suggested.
“Sha’mad Conde,” Rhuarc agreed. He and Mangin turned Estean—theywere holding him up—
and started toward the other soldiers.
“Ask!” Rand called after them. “He is your ally, and my liege man.” He had no idea whether
Estean was that last or not—it was another thing to ask Moiraine—or even how much of an ally he
really was—his father, the High Lord Torean, had plotted against Rand enough—but he would allow
nothing close to Couladin’s ways.
Rhuarc turned his head and nodded.
“You tend your people well, Rand al’Thor.” Sulin’s voice was flat as a planed plank.
“I try,” he told her. He was not about to rise to the bait. Whoever went to scout the Shaido, some
would not return, and that was that. “I think I will have something to eat now. And get some sleep.” It
could not be much more than two hours to midnight, and sunrise still came early this time of year. The
Maidens followed him, watching the shadows warily as if they expected attack, handtalk flickering
among them. But then, Aiel always seemed to expect attack.

CHAPTER
31

The Far Snows

The streets of Eianrod ran straight and met at right angles, where necessary slicing through hills
that were otherwise neatly terraced with stone. The slate-roofed stone buildings had an angular look,
as if they were all vertical lines. Eianrod had not fallen to Couladin; no people had been there when
the Shaido swept through. A good many of the houses were only charred beams and hollow ruined
shells, however, including most of the wide three-story marble buildings with balconies that
Moiraine said had belonged to merchants. Broken furniture and clothes littered the streets, along with
shattered dishes and shards of glass from windows, single boots and tools and toys.
The burning had come at different times—Rand could tell that much himself, from the weathering
of blackened timbers and how much smell of char lingered where—but Lan had been able to chart the
flow of battles by which the town had been taken and retaken. By different Houses contending for the
Sun Throne, most likely, though from the look of the streets, the last to hold Eianrod had been
brigands. A good many of the bands roaming Cairhien held allegiance to no one, and to nothing except
gold.
It was to one of the merchants’ houses that Rand went, on the largest of the town’s two squares,
three square stories of gray marble with heavy balconies and wide steps with thick angular stone
siderails overlooking a silent fountain with a dusty round basin. A chance to sleep in a bed again had
been too good to pass up, and he had hopes that Aviendha would choose to remain in a tent; whether
his or with the Wise Ones, he did not care, so long as he did not have to try going to sleep while
listening to her breathe a few paces away. Recently he had begun imagining he could hear her heart
beat even when he had not taken hold of saidin. But if she did not stay away, he had taken
precautions.
The Maidens stopped at the steps, some trotting around the building to take positions on all
sides. He had feared that they would try declaring this a Roof of the Maidens, even for the one night,
and so as soon as he had chosen the building, one of the few in town with a sound roof and most of the
windows unbroken, he had told Sulin that he was declaring it the Roof of the Winespring Brothers.
No one could enter who had not drunk from the Winespring, in Emond’s Field. From the look she had
given him, she knew very well what he was up to, but none of them followed him beyond the wide
doors that seemed to be all narrow vertical panels.
Inside, the large rooms were bare, though white-robed gai’shain had spread a few blankets for
themselves in the broad entry hall, its high plaster ceiling worked in a pattern of severe squares.
Keeping gai’shain out was beyond him even had he wanted to, as much so as keeping Moiraine out if
she was not asleep elsewhere. Whatever orders he gave about not being disturbed, she always found
a way to make the Maidens let her by, and it always took a direct command for her to go before she
would leave.

The gai’shain rose smoothly, men and women, before he had the door closed. They would not
sleep until he did, and some would take turns remaining awake in case he wanted something in the
night. He had tried ordering them not to, but telling a gai’shain not to serve according to custom was
like kicking a bale of wool; whatever impression you made was gone as soon as your toes were. He
waved them away and climbed the marble stairs. Some of those gai’shain had salvaged a few bits of
furniture, including a bed and two feather mattresses, and he was looking forward to washing and—
He froze as soon as he opened the door to his bedchamber. Aviendha had not chosen to remain
with the tents. She stood before the washstand, with its mismatched, cracked bowl and pitcher, a cloth
in one hand and a bar of yellow soap in the other. She had no clothes on. She seemed as stunned as
he, as incapable of moving.
“I . . .” She stopped to swallow, big green eyes locked on his face. “I could not make a sweat
tent here in this . . . town, so I thought I would try your way of . . .” She was hard muscle and soft
curves; she glistened damply from head to feet. He had never imagined that her legs were so long. “I
thought you would remain longer at the bridge. I . . .” Her voice rose in pitch; her eyes widened in
panic. “I did not arrange for you to see me! I must get away from you. As far away as I can! I must!”
Suddenly a shimmering vertical line appeared in the air near her. It widened, as if rotating, into a
gateway. Icy wind rushed through it into the room, carrying thick curtains of snow.
“I must get away!” she wailed, and darted through into the blizzard.
Immediately the gateway began to narrow again, turning, but without thought Rand channeled,
blocking it at half its former width. He did not know what he had done or how, but he was sure this
was a gateway for Traveling, such as Asmodean had told him of and been unable to teach him. There
was no time for thinking. Wherever Aviendha had gone, she had gone naked into the heart of a winter
storm. Rand tied off the flows he had woven as he ripped all the blankets from the bed and tossed
them onto her clothes and pallet. Seizing blankets, clothes and rugs all together, he plunged through
only moments behind her.
Icy wind screamed through night air filled with swirling white. Even wrapped in the Void, he
could feel his body shivering. Dimly he could make out scattered shapes in the darkness; trees, he
thought. There was nothing for him to smell but cold. Ahead of him, a form moved, obscured by
darkness and the snowstorm; he might have missed it but for the sharpness of his eyes in the Void.
Aviendha, running as hard as she could. He lumbered after her through snow to his knees, clutching
the thick bundle to his chest.
“Aviendha! Stop!” He was afraid that the howling wind would sweep his shout away, but she
heard. And if anything, ran faster. He forced himself to more speed, staggering and tripping as the
deepening snow tugged at his boots. The prints left by her bare feet were filling fast. If he lost sight of
her in this. . . . “Stop, you fool woman! Are you trying to kill yourself?” The sound of his voice
seemed to flog her to run harder.
Grimly, he pushed himself, half-falling and scrambling back up, knocked down by the hurtling
wind as often as stumbling in the snow, blundering into trees. He had to keep his eyes on her. He was
only thankful this forest, or whatever it was, had trees so far apart.
Plans skittered across the Void and were discarded. He could try quelling the storm—and maybe
the result would turn the air to ice. A shelter of Air to keep the falling snow away would do nothing
for that underfoot. He could melt a path for himself with Fire—and slog through mud instead. Unless
...
He channeled, and the snow ahead of him melted in a band a span wide, a band that ran ahead of
him as he did. Steam rose, and falling snow vanished a foot above the sandy soil. He could feel the

heat of it through his boots. Down almost to his ankles, his body shook with the bone-chilling cold;
his feet sweated and flinched away from the heated ground. But he was catching up now. Another five
minutes and . . .
Suddenly the vague shape he had been following vanished as if she had fallen into a hole.
Keeping his eyes fixed on the spot where he had last seen her, he ran as hard as he could.
Abruptly he was splashing in icy flowing water to his ankles, halfway to his knees. Ahead of him, the
melting snow revealed more, and an edge of ice inching slowly back. No steam rose from the black
water. Stream or river, it was too big for the amount of his channeling to warm the swift-moving flow
even a hair. She must have run out onto the ice and fallen through, but he would not save her by trying
to wade into this. Filled with saidin, he was barely aware of the cold, but his teeth chattered
uncontrollably.
Retreating to the bank, gaze locked on where he thought Aviendha had gone down, he channeled
flows of Fire into ground still bare, well back from the stream, until the sand melted and fused and
glowed white. Even in this storm, that would stay hot for a time. He set the bundle down in the snow
beside it—her life would depend on finding the blankets and rugs again—then waded through the
deep white to one side of the melted path and lay flat. Slowly he crawled out onto the snow-covered
ice.
The wind shrieked across him. His coat might as well not have existed. His hands were numb
now, and his feet going; he had stopped shivering except for an occasional shudder. Coldly calm
inside the Void, he knew what was happening; there were blizzards in the Two Rivers, perhaps even
as bad as this. His body was being overwhelmed. If he did not find warmth soon, he would be able to
calmly watch from the Void as he died. But if he died, Aviendha would, too. If she had not already.
He felt rather than heard the ice cracking beneath his weight. His probing hands fell into water.
This was the place, but with snow whirling about, he could barely see. He flailed, searching, numb
hands splashing. One hit something at the edge of the ice, and he commanded his fingers to close, felt
frozen hair crackling.
Got to pull her out. He crawled backward, hauling at her. She was a dead weight, sliding
slowly out of the water. Don’t care if the ice scrapes her. Better that than freezing or drowning.
Back. Keep moving. If you quit, she dies. Keep moving, burn you! Crawling. Pulling with his legs,
pushing with one hand. The other locked in Aviendha’s hair; no time to get a better grip; she could not
feel it anyway. You’ve had it easy for too long. Lords kneeling, and gai’shain running to fetch your
wine, and Moiraine doing as she’s told. Back. Time to do something yourself if you still can.
Move, you flaming fatherless son of a spavined goat! Keep moving!
Suddenly his feet hurt; the pain began creeping up his legs. It took him a moment to look back,
and then he rolled off the steaming patch of melted sand. Tendrils of smoke, where his breeches had
begun smoldering, were whisked away by the wind.
Fumbling for the bundle he had left, he swathed Aviendha from head to foot in all of it, the
blankets, the rugs of her pallet, her clothes. Every bit of protection was vital. Her eyes were closed,
and she did not move. He parted the blankets enough to put an ear to her chest. Her heart beat so
slowly that he was not sure he was really hearing it. Even four blankets and half a dozen rugs were
not enough, and he could not channel heat into her as he had the ground; even fining the flow as much
as possible, he was more likely to kill than warm. He could feel the weave he had used to block open
her gateway, a mile or perhaps two away through the storm. If he tried to carry her that far, neither of
them would survive. They needed shelter, and they needed it here.
He channeled flows of Air, and snow began to move across the ground against the wind,

building into thick square walls three paces on a side with one gap for a door, building higher,
compacting the snow till it glistened like ice, roofing it over high enough to stand. Scooping Aviendha
into his arms, he stumbled into the dark interior, weaving and tying flames dancing in the corners for
light, channeling to scoop more snow to close the doorway.
Just with the wind shut away it felt warmer, but that would not be enough. Using the trick
Asmodean had shown him, he wove Air and Fire, and the air around them grew warmer. He did not
dare tie that weave off; if he fell asleep, it could grow and melt the hut. For that matter, the flames
were almost as dangerous to leave, but he was too bone-weary and chilled to maintain more than one
weave.
The ground inside had been cleared as he built, bare sandy soil with only a few brown leaves he
did not recognize and some scruffy low dead weeds that were equally strange to him. Releasing the
weave that warmed the air, he heated the ground enough to take away the iciness, then took up the
other weave again. It was all he could do to lay Aviendha down gently rather than drop her.
He pushed a hand inside the blankets to feel her cheek, her shoulder. Trickles of water ran
across her face as her hair melted. He was cold, but she was ice. She needed every scrap of warmth
he could find for her, and he did not dare warm the air more. Already the insides of the walls shone
with a faint layer of melt. However frozen he felt, he had more heat in him than she did.
Stripping off his clothes, he climbed into the coverings with her, arranging his own damp
garments on the outside; they could help hold in the body heat. His sense of touch, enhanced by the
Void and saidin, soaked in the feel of her. Her skin made silk feel rough. Compared to her skin, satin
was . . . Don’t think. He smoothed damp hair away from her face. He should have dried it, but the
water no longer felt so cold, and there was nothing but the blankets or their clothes to use anyway.
Her eyes were closed; her chest stirred against him slowly. Her head lay on his arm, snuggled against
his chest. If she had not felt like winter itself, she could have been sleeping. So peaceful; not angry at
all. So beautiful. Stop thinking. It was a sharp command outside the emptiness surrounding him. Talk.
He tried talking of the first thing that came to mind, Elayne and the confusion her two letters
brought, but that soon had thoughts of golden-haired Elayne drifting across the Void, of kissing her in
secluded spots in the Stone. Don’t think of kissing, fool! He shifted to Min. He had never thought
about Min that way. Well, a few dreams could not count. Min would have slapped his face if he had
ever tried to kiss her, or else laughed and called him a woolhead. Only it seemed that speaking of any
woman reminded him that he had his arms around a woman who had no clothes on. Filled with the
Power, he could smell the scent of her, feel every inch of her as clearly as if he were running his
hands . . . The Void trembled. Light, you’re only trying to warm her! Keep your mind out of the
pigsty, man!
Trying to drive thought away, he talked of his hopes for Cairhien, to bring peace and an end to
the famine, to bring the nations behind him without any more bloodshed. But that had its own life, too,
its own inevitable path, to Shayol Ghul, where he must face the Dark One and die, if the Prophecies
were true. It seemed cowardly to say that he hoped he might live through that somehow. Aiel did not
know cowardice; the worst of them was brave as a lion. “The Breaking of the World killed the
weak,” he had heard Bael say, “and the Three-fold Land killed the cowards.”
He began speaking of where they might be, where she had brought them with her wild senseless
flight. Somewhere far and strange, to have snow at this time of year. It had been worse than a
senseless flight. Mad. Yet he knew that she had fled from him. Fled from him. How she must hate him,
if she had to flee as far as she could rather than just tell him to leave her to her bath in privacy.
“I should have knocked.” At his own bedroom door? “I know you do not want to be around me.

You don’t have to be. Whatever the Wise Ones want, whatever they say, you are going back to their
tents. You will not have to come near me again. In fact, if you do, I . . . I’ll send you away.” Why
hesitate on that? She gave him anger, coldness, bitterness when she was awake, and asleep. . . . “It
was a crazy thing to do. You could have killed yourself.” He was stroking her hair again; he could not
seem to stop. “If you ever do anything half so crazy again, I’ll break your neck. Do you have any idea
how I will miss hearing you breathe at night?” Miss it? She drove him crazy with it! He was the one
who was mad. He had to stop this. “You are going away, and that’s that, if I have to send you back to
Rhuidean. The Wise Ones can’t stop me if I speak as Car’a’carn. You won’t have to run away from
me again.”
The hand that he could not stop from stroking her hair froze as she stirred. She was warm, he
realized. Very warm. He should be wrapping one of the blankets about himself decently and moving
away. Her eyes opened, clear and deep, green, staring at him seriously from not a foot away. She did
not seem surprised to see him, and she did not pull back.
He took his arms from around her, started to slither away, and she seized a handful of his hair in
a painful grip. If he moved, he would have a bald patch. She gave him no chance to explain anything.
“I promised my near-sister to watch you.” She seemed to be speaking to herself as much as to him, in
a low, almost expressionless voice. “I ran from you as hard as I could, to shield my honor. And you
followed me even here. The rings do not lie, and I can run no more.” Her tone firmed decisively. “I
will run no more.”
Rand tried to ask her what she meant while attempting to untangle her fingers from his hair, but
she clutched another handful on the other side and pulled his mouth to hers. That was the end of
rational thought; the Void shattered, and saidin fled. He did not think he could have stopped himself
had he wanted to, only he could not think of wanting to, and she certainly did not seem to want him to.
In fact, the last thought he had of any coherency for a very long time was that he did not think he could
have stopped her.
Some considerable time later—two hours, maybe three; he could hardly be sure—he lay atop the
rugs with the blankets over him and his hands behind his head, watching Aviendha examine the slick
white walls. They had held a surprising amount of the warmth; there was no need to latch on to saidin
again, either to shut out cold or to try warming the air. She had done no more than rake her fingers
through her hair on rising, and she moved completely unashamed at her nakedness. Of course, it was a
bit late to be ashamed of something as small as having no clothes on. He had been worried about
hurting her when dragging her out of the water, but she showed fewer scrapes than he did, and
somehow they did not seem to mar her beauty at all.
“What is this?” she asked.
“Snow.” He explained what snow was as best he could, but she only shook her head, partly in
wonderment, partly disbelief. For someone who had grown up in the Waste, frozen water falling from
the sky must seem as impossible as flying. According to the records, the only time it had ever even
rained in the Waste was the time he had made it.
He could not stop a sigh of regret when she began pulling her shift over her head. “The Wise
Ones can marry us as soon as we get back.” He could still feel his weave holding her gateway open.
Aviendha’s dark reddish head popped through the neck of the shift, and she stared at him flatly.
Not unfriendly, but not friendly, either. Determined, though. “What makes you think a man has the right
to ask me that? Besides, you belong to Elayne.”
After a moment he managed to close his mouth. “Aviendha, we just . . . The two of us . . . Light,
we have to marry now. Not that I’m doing it because I have to,” he added hastily. “I want to.” He was

not sure of that at all, really. He thought he might love her, but he thought he might love Elayne, too.
And for some reason, Min kept creeping in. You’re as big a lecher as Mat. But for once he could do
what was right because it was right.
She sniffed at him and felt her stockings to be sure they were dry, then sat down to don them.
“Egwene has spoken to me of your Two Rivers marriage customs.”
“You want to wait a year?” he asked incredulously.
“The year. Yes, that is what I meant.” He had never realized before how much leg a woman
showed pulling on a stocking; odd that that could seem so thrilling after he had seen her naked and
sweating and . . . He concentrated on listening to her. “Egwene said she thought of asking her
mother’s permission for you, but before she mentioned it her mother told her she had to wait another
year even if she did have her hair in a braid.” Aviendha frowned, one knee almost under her chin. “Is
that right? She said a girl was not allowed to braid her hair until she was old enough to marry. Do you
understand what I am saying? You look like that . . . fish . . . Moiraine caught in the river.” There
were no fish in the Waste; Aiel knew them only from books.
“Of course I do,” he said. He might as well have been deaf and blind for all he understood.
Shifting under the blankets, he made himself sound as sure as he could manage. “At least . . . Well, the
customs are complicated, and I am not certain which part you are talking about.”
She looked at him suspiciously for a moment, but Aiel customs were so intricate that she
believed him. In the Two Rivers, you walked out for a year, and if you suited, then you became
betrothed and finally married; that was as far as custom went. She went on as she dressed. “I meant
about a girl asking her mother’s permission during the year, and the Wisdom’s. I cannot say I
understand that.” The white blouse going over her head muffled her words for a moment. “If she
wants him, and she is old enough to marry, why should she need permission? But you see? By my
customs,” her tone of voice said they were the only ones that mattered, “it is my place to choose
whether to ask you, and I will not. By your customs,” fastening her belt, she shook her head
dismissively, “I did not have my mother’s permission. And you would need your father’s, I suppose.
Or your father-brother’s, since your father is dead? We did not have them, so we cannot marry.” She
began folding the scarf to wrap around her forehead.
“I see,” he said weakly. Any boy in the Two Rivers who asked his father for that kind of
permission was asking to have his ears soundly boxed. When he thought of the lads who had sweated
themselves silly worrying that someone, anyone, would find out what they were doing with the girl
they meant to marry . . . For that matter, he remembered when Nynaeve caught Kimry Lewin and Bar
Dowtry in Bar’s father’s hayloft. Kimry had had her hair braided for five years, but when Nynaeve
was through with her, Mistress Lewin had taken over. The Women’s Circle had nearly skinned poor
Bar alive, and that was nothing to what they had done to Kimry over the month they thought was the
shortest decent time to wait for a wedding. The joke told quietly, where it would not get to the
Women’s Circle, had been that neither Bar nor Kimry had been able to sit down the whole first week
they were married. Rand supposed Kimry had failed to ask permission. “But I guess Egwene
wouldn’t know all the men’s customs, after all,” he continued. “Women don’t know everything. You
see, since I started it, we have to marry. It doesn’t matter about permissions.”
“You started it?” Her sniff was pointed and meaning. Aiel, Andoran or anything else, women
used those noises like sticks, to prod or thump. “It does not matter anyway, since we are going by
Aiel customs. This will not happen again, Rand al’Thor.” He was surprised—and pleased—to hear
regret in her voice. “You belong to the near-sister of my near-sister. I have toh to Elayne, now, but
that is none of your concern. Are you going to lie there forever? I have heard that men turn lazy, after,

but it cannot be long until the clans are ready to begin the morning’s march. You must be there.”
Suddenly a stricken look crossed her face, and she sagged to her knees. “If we can return. I am not
certain that I remember what I did to make the hole, Rand al’Thor. You must find our way back.”
He told her how he had blocked her gateway and could still feel it holding. She looked relieved,
and even smiled at him. But it became increasingly clear as she folded her legs and arranged her
skirts that she did not mean to turn her back while he dressed.
“Fair’s fair,” he muttered after a long moment, and scrambled out of the blankets.
He tried to be as nonchalant as she had been, but it was not easy. He could feel her eyes like a
touch even when he turned away from her. She had no call to tell him he had a pretty behind; he had
not said anything about how pretty hers was. She only said it to make him blush, anyway. Women did
not look at men that way. And they don’t ask their mother’s permission to . . . ? He had an idea that
life with Aviendha had not become one bit easier.

CHAPTER
32

A Short Spear

There was little discussion. Even if the storm still raged outside, they could make it back to the
gateway using the blankets and rugs for cloaks. Aviendha began dividing them while he seized saidin,
filling himself with life and death, molten fire and liquid ice.
“Split them equally,” he told her. He knew his voice was cold and emotionless. Asmodean had
said he could go beyond that, but he had not managed to so far.
She gave him a surprised look, but all she said was “There is more of you to cover,” and went
on as she was.
There was no point in arguing. In his experience, from Emond’s Field to the Maidens, if a
woman wanted to do something for you, the only way to stop her was to tie her up, especially if it
involved sacrifice on her part. The surprise was that she had not sounded acid, had not said anything
about him being a soft wetlander. Maybe something good besides a memory had come out of this. She
can’t really mean never again. He suspected that she meant exactly that, though.
Weaving a finger-thin flow of Fire, he sliced the outline of a door in one wall, widening the gap
at the top. Startlingly, daylight shone through. Releasing saidin, he exchanged surprised looks with
Aviendha. He knew he had lost track of time—You lost track of the year—but they could not have
been inside that long. Wherever they were, it was a great distance from Cairhien.
He pushed against the block, but it did not budge until he put his back to it, dug in his heels and
shoved with all of his might. Just as it occurred to him that he very probably could have done this
more easily with the Power, the block toppled outward, taking him with it into cold, crisp pale
daylight. Not all the way, though. It stopped at an angle, propped against snow that had built up
around the hut. Lying on his back, with only a bit of his head sticking out, he could see other mounds,
some smooth drifts around sparse, stunted trees that he did not recognize, others maybe burying
bushes or boulders.
He opened his mouth—and forgot what he was going to say as something swept through the air
not fifty feet above him, a leathery gray shape far bigger than a horse, on slow-beating widespread
wings, a horny snout thrust out before and clawed feet and thin, lizardlike tail trailing behind. His
head twisted on its own to follow the thing’s flight over the trees. There were two people on its back;
despite what seemed to be some sort of hooded garments, it was plain that they were scanning the
ground below. If he had had more than his head showing, if he had not been directly under the
creature, they would surely have seen him.
“Leave the blankets,” he said as he ducked back inside. He told her what he had seen. “Maybe
they’d be friendly and maybe not, but I’d as soon not find out.” He was not sure he wanted to meet
people who rode something like that in any case. If they were people. “We are going to sneak back to

the gateway. As quickly as we can, but sneaking.”
For a wonder she did not argue. When he commented on it as he was helping her climb over the
ice block—that was a wonder, too; she accepted his hand without so much as a glare—she said, “I do
not argue when you make sense, Rand al’Thor.” That was hardly the way he remembered it.
The land around them lay flat beneath its deep blanket of snow, but to the west sharp, whitetipped mountains rose, peaks wreathed in cloud. He had no difficulty knowing they lay west, for the
sun was rising. Less than half its golden ball stuck above the ocean. He stared at that. The land
slanted down enough for him to see waves crashing in violent spray on a rocky, boulder-strewn shore
maybe half a mile away. An ocean to the east, stretching endlessly to horizon and sun. If the snow had
not been enough, that told him they were in no land he knew.
Aviendha stared at the rolling breakers and pounding waves in amazement, then frowned at him
as it hit home. She might never have seen an ocean, but she had seen maps.
In her skirts the snow gave her even more trouble than it did him, and he floundered, digging his
way through as much as walking, sometimes sinking to his waist. She gasped as he scooped her up in
his arms, and her green eyes glared.
“We have to move faster than you can dragging those skirts,” he told her. The glare faded, but
she did not put an arm around his neck, as he had half-hoped. Instead she folded her hands and put on
a patient face. A bit touched with sullenness. Whatever changes what they had done might have
wrought in her, she was not completely different. He could not understand why that should be a relief.
He could have melted a path through the snow as he had in the storm, but if another of those
flying things came, that cleared path would lead straight to them. A fox trotted by across the snow
well to his right, pure white except for a black tip to its bushy tail, occasionally eyeing him and
Aviendha warily. Rabbit tracks marred the snow in places, blurred where they had leapt, and once he
saw the prints of a cat that had to be as large as a leopard. Maybe there were larger animals still,
maybe some flightless relative of that leathery creature. Not something he wanted to encounter, but
there was always the chance the . . . fliers . . . might take the plowed furrow he was leaving now as
the track of some animal.
He still made his way from tree to tree, wishing there were more of them, and closer together. Of
course, if there had been, he might not have found Aviendha in the storm—she grunted, frowning up at
him, and he loosened his hold on her again—but it would surely have helped now. It was because he
was creeping in that way, though, that he saw the others first.
Less than fifty paces away, between him and the gateway—right at the gateway; he could feel his
weave holding it—were four people on horseback and more than twenty afoot. The mounted were all
women shrouded in long thick, fur-lined cloaks; two of them each wore a silvery bracelet on her left
wrist, connected by a long leash of the same shining stuff to a bright collar tight around the neck of a
gray-clad, cloakless woman standing in the snow. The others afoot were men in dark leather, and
armor painted green and gold, overlapping plates down their chests and the outsides of their arms and
fronts of their thighs. Their spears bore green-and-gold tassels, their long shields were painted in the
same colors, and their helmets seemed to be the heads of huge insects, faces peering out through the
mandibles. One was clearly an officer, lacking spear or shield, but with a curved, two-handed sword
on his back. Silver outlined the plates of his lacquered armor, and thin green plumes, like feelers,
heightened the illusion of his painted helmet. Rand knew where he and Aviendha were now. He had
seen armor like that before. And women collared like that.
Setting her down behind something that looked a little like a wind-twisted pine, except that its
trunk was smooth and gray, streaked with black, he pointed, and she nodded silently.

“The two women on leashes can channel,” he whispered. “Can you block them?” Hurriedly he
added, “Don’t embrace the Source yet. They’re prisoners, but they still might warn the others, and
even if they don’t, the women with the bracelets might be able to feel them sense you.”
She looked at him oddly, but wasted no time on foolish questions such as how he knew; they
would come later, he knew. “The women with the bracelets can channel also,” she replied just as
softly. “It feels very strange, though. Weak. As if they had never practiced it. I cannot see how that
can be.”
Rand could. Damane were the ones who were supposed to be able to channel. If two women
had somehow slipped through the Seanchan net to become sul’dam instead—and from the little he
knew of them, that would not be easy, for the Seanchan tested every last woman during the years that
she might first show signs of channeling—they would surely never dare to betray themselves. “Can
you shield all four?”
She gave him a very smug look. “Of course. Egwene taught me to handle several flows at once. I
can block them, tie those off, and wrap them up in flows of Air before they know what is happening.”
That self-satisfied little smile faded. “I am fast enough to handle them, and their horses, but that
leaves the rest to you until I can bring help. If any get away . . . They can surely cast those spears this
far, and if one of them pins you to the ground . . .” For a moment she muttered under her breath, as if
angry that she could not complete a sentence. Finally she looked at him, her gaze as furious as he had
ever seen it. “Egwene has told me of Healing, but she knows little, and I less.”
What could she be angry about now? Better to try understanding the sun than a woman, he
thought wryly. Thom Merrilin had told him that, and it was simple truth. “You take care of shielding
those women,” he told her. “I will do the rest. Not until I touch your arm, though.”
He could tell she thought he was boasting, but he would not have to split flows, only weave one
intricate flow of Air that would bind arms to sides and hold horses’ feet as well as human. Taking a
deep breath, he grabbed hold of saidin, touched her arm and channeled.
Shocked cries rose from the Seanchan. He should have thought of gags, too, but they could be
through the gateway before they attracted anyone else. Holding on to the Source, he seized
Aviendha’s arm and half-dragged her through the snow, ignoring her snarls that she could walk. At
least this way he broke a trail for her, and they had to hurry.
The Seanchan quieted, staring as he and Aviendha made their way around in front of them. The
two women who were not sul’dam had thrown back their hoods, struggling against his weave. He
held it rather than tying; he would have to release it when he went anyway; for the simple reason that
he could not leave even Seanchan bound in the snow. If they did not freeze to death, there was always
the big cat whose tracks he had seen. Where there was one, there must be more.
The gateway was there all right, but instead of looking into his room in Eianrod, it was a gray
blank. It seemed narrower than he remembered, too. Worse, he could see the weave of that grayness.
It had been woven from saidin. Furious thought slid across the Void. He could not tell what it was
meant to do, yet it could easily be a trap for whoever stepped through, woven by one of the male
Forsaken. By Asmodean, most likely; if the man could hand him over to the others, he might be able to
regain his place among them. Yet there could be no question of staying here. If Aviendha only
remembered how she had woven the gateway in the first place, she could open another, but as it was,
they were going to have to use this, trap or no.
One of the mounted women, a black raven in front of a stark tower on the gray breast of her
cloak, had a severe face and dark eyes that seemed to want to drill into his skull. Another, younger
and paler and shorter, yet more regal, wore a silver stag’s head on her green cloak. The little fingers

of her riding gloves were too long. Rand knew from the shaven sides of her scalp that those long
fingers covered nails grown long and no doubt lacquered, both signs of Seanchan nobility. The
soldiers were stiff-faced and stiff-backed, but the officer’s blue eyes glittered behind the jaws of the
insectlike helmet, and his gauntleted fingers writhed as he struggled futilely to reach his sword.
Rand did not care very much about them, but he did not want to leave the damane behind. At the
least he could give them a chance to escape. They might be staring at him as they would a wild animal
with bared fangs, but they had not chosen to be prisoners, treated little better than domestic animals
themselves. He put a hand to the collar of the nearest, and felt a jolt that nearly numbed his arm; for an
instant the Void shifted, and saidin raged through him like the snowstorm a thousandfold. The
damane’s short yellow hair flailed as she convulsed at his touch, screaming, and the sul’dam
connected to her gasped, face going white. Both would have fallen if not held by bonds of Air.
“You try it,” he told Aviendha, working his hand. “A woman must be able to touch the thing
safely. I don’t know how it unfastens.” It looked of a piece, linked somehow, just like bracelet and
leash. “But it went on, so it must be able to come off.” A few moments could not make any difference
to whatever had happened to the gateway. Was it Asmodean?
Aviendha shook her head, but began fumbling at the other woman’s collar. “Hold still,” she
growled as the damane, a pale-faced girl of sixteen or seventeen, tried to flinch back. If the leashed
women had looked on Rand as a wild beast, they stared at Aviendha like a nightmare made flesh.
“She is marath’damane,” the pale girl wailed. “Save Seri, mistress! Please, mistress! Save
Seri!” The other damane, older, almost motherly, began weeping uncontrollably. Aviendha glared at
Rand as hard as she did the girl for some reason, muttering angrily under her breath as she worked at
the collar.
“It is he, Lady Morsa,” the other damane’s sul’dam said suddenly in a soft drawl that Rand
could barely understand. “I have borne the bracelet long, and I could tell if the marath’damane had
done more than block Jini.”
Morsa did not look surprised. In fact, there seemed to be a light of horrified recognition in her
blue eyes as she gazed at Rand. There was only one way that could be.
“You were at Falme,” he said. If he went through first, it meant leaving Aviendha behind,
although only for a moment.
“I was.” The noblewoman looked faint, but her slow, slurring voice was coolly imperious. “I
saw you, and what you did.”
“Take a care I don’t do the same here. Give me no trouble, and I will leave you in peace.” He
could not send Aviendha first, into the Light knew what. If emotion had not been so distant, he would
have grimaced the way she was grimacing over that collar. They had to go through together, and be
ready to face anything.
“Much has been kept secret about what happened in the lands of the great Hawkwing, Lady
Morsa,” the severe-faced woman said. Her dark eyes were as hard on Morsa as they had been on
him. “Rumors fly that the Ever Victorious Army has tasted defeat.”
“Do you now seek truth in rumor, Jalindin?” Morsa asked in a cutting tone. “A Seeker above all
should know when to keep silent. The Empress herself has forbidden speech of the Corenne until she
calls it again. If you—or I—speak so much as the name of the city where that expedition landed, our
tongues will be removed. Perhaps you would enjoy being tongueless, in the Tower of Ravens? Not
even the Listeners would hear you scream for mercy, or pay heed.”
Rand understood no more than two words in three, and it was not the odd accents. He wished he
had time to listen. Corenne. The Return. That was what the Seanchan in Falme had called their

attempt to seize the lands beyond the Aryth Ocean—the lands where he lived—that they considered
their birthright. The rest—Seeker, Listeners, the Tower of Ravens—were a mystery. But apparently
the Return had been called off, for the time being at least. That was worth knowing.
The gateway was narrower. Maybe as much as a finger width narrower than moments before.
Only his block held it open; it had tried to close as soon as Aviendha released her weave, and it was
still trying to.
“Hurry,” he told Aviendha, and she gave him a look so patient it could as well have been a stone
between his eyes.
“I am trying, Rand al’Thor,” she said, still working at the collar. Tears trickled down Seri’s
cheeks; a continuous low moan came from her throat, as if the Aiel woman intended to slit it. “You
nearly killed the other two, and maybe yourself. I could feel the Power rushing into both of them
wildly when you touched the other collar. So leave me to it, and if I can do it, I will.” Muttering a
curse, she tried at the side.
Rand thought about making the sul’dam remove the collars—if anyone knew how the things
came off, they would—but from the set frowns on their faces, he knew he would have to force them to
it. If he could not kill a woman, he could not very well torture one.
With a sigh he glanced at the gray blankness filling the gateway again. The flows appeared to be
woven into his; he could not slice one without the other. Passing through might trigger the trap, but
cutting away the grayness, even if that act did not trip it, would allow the gateway to snap shut before
they had a chance to leap through. It would have to be a blind jump into the Light knew what.
Morsa had listened carefully to every word he and Aviendha said, and now she was gazing
thoughtfully at the two sul’dam, but Jalindin had never taken her eyes from the noblewoman’s face.
“Much has been kept secret that should not be held from the Seekers, Lady Morsa,” the stern woman
said. “The Seekers must know all.”
“You forget yourself, Jalindin,” Morsa snapped, her gloved hands jerking; had her arms not been
bound to her sides, she would have sawed the reins. As it was, she tilted her head to stare down her
nose at the other woman. “You were sent to me because Sarek looks above himself and has designs
on Serengada Dai and Tuel, not to ask of what the Empress has—”
Jalindin broke in harshly. “It is you who forgets herself, Lady Morsa, if you think that you are
proof against the Seekers for Truth. I myself have put both a daughter and a son of the Empress, may
the Light bless her, to the question, and in gratitude for the confessions I wrenched from them she
allowed me to gaze upon her. Think you that your minor House stands higher than the Empress’s own
children?”
Morsa remained upright, not that she had much choice, but her face went gray, and she licked her
lips. “The Empress, may the Light illumine her forever, already knows far more than I can tell. I did
not mean to imply—”
The Seeker cut her off again, twisting her head to speak to the soldiers as if Morsa did not exist.
“The woman Morsa is in the custody of the Seekers for Truth. She will be put to the question as soon
as we return to Merinloe. And the sul’dam and damane, as well. It seems they, too, have hidden what
they should not.” Horror painted the faces of the named women, but Morsa could have stood for any
of them. Eyes wide and suddenly haggard, she slumped as much as her invisible bonds would allow,
voicing not a word of protest. She looked as if she wanted to scream, yet she—accepted. Jalindin’s
gaze turned to Rand. “She named you Rand al’Thor. You will be well treated if you surrender to me,
Rand al’Thor. However you came here, you cannot think to escape even if you kill us. There is a
wide search for a marath’damane who channeled in the night.” Her eyes flickered to Aviendha. “It

will find you as well, inevitably, and you might be slain by accident. There is sedition in this district.
I do not know how men like you are treated in your lands, but in Seanchan your sufferings can be
eased. Here, you can find great honor in the use of your power.”
He laughed at her, and she looked offended. “I cannot kill you, but I vow I should stripe your
hide at least for that.” He certainly would not have to worry about being gentled in Seanchan hands. In
Seanchan, men who could channel were killed. Not executed. Hunted and shot down on sight.
The gray-filled gateway was another finger narrower, barely wide enough now for both of them
to pass through together. “Leave her, Aviendha. We have to go now.”
She released Seri’s collar and gave him an exasperated look, but her eyes went past him to the
gateway, and she hoisted her skirts to stump through the snow to him, muttering to herself about frozen
water.
“Be ready for anything,” he told her, putting an arm around her shoulders. He told himself they
had to be close together to fit. Not because she felt good. “I don’t know what, but be ready.” She
nodded, and he said, “Jump!”
Together they leaped into the grayness, Rand releasing the weave that had held the Seanchan in
order to fill himself to bursting with saidin . . .
. . . and landed stumbling in his bedchamber in Eianrod, lamplit, with darkness outside the
windows.
Asmodean sat against the wall beside the door with his legs crossed. He was not embracing the
Source, but Rand slammed a block between the man and saidin anyway. Whirling with his arm still
around Aviendha, he found the gateway gone. No, not gone—he could still see his weaving, and what
he knew must be Asmodean’s—but there seemed to be nothing there at all. Without pause he slashed
his weave, and suddenly the gateway appeared, a rapidly narrowing view of Seanchan, the Lady
Morsa slumped in her saddle, Jalindin shouting orders. A green-and-white tasseled spear lanced
through the opening, just before it snapped shut. Instinctively, Rand channeled Air to snatch the
suddenly wobbling two-foot length of spear. The shaft ended as smoothly as any craftsman could have
worked it. Shivering, he was glad that he had not tried removing the gray barrier—whatever it had
been—before jumping through.
“A good thing neither of the sul’dam recovered in time,” he said, taking the severed spear in his
hand, “or we’d have had worse than this coming after us.” He watched Asmodean from the corner of
his eye, but the man only sat there, looking slightly ill. He could not know whether Rand meant to stuff
that spear down his throat.
Aviendha’s sniff was her most pointed yet. “Do you think I released them?” she said heatedly.
She removed his arm firmly, but he did not think her temper was for him. Or not for his arm, anyway.
“I tied their shields as tightly as I could. They are your enemies, Rand al’Thor. Even the ones you
called damane are faithful dogs who would have killed you rather than be free. You must be hard
with your enemies, not soft.”
She was right, he thought, hefting the spear. He had left enemies behind that he might well have
to face one day. He had to become harder. Or else he would be ground to flour before he ever
reached Shayol Ghul.
Abruptly she began smoothing her skirts, and her voice became almost conversational. “I notice
that you did not save that whey-faced Morsa from her fate. From the way you looked at her, I thought
big eyes and a round bosom had caught your eye.”
Rand stared at her in amazement that oozed across the emptiness surrounding him like syrup. She
could have been saying the soup was ready. He wondered how he was supposed to have noticed

Morsa’s bosom, hidden as it was in a fur-lined cloak. “I should have brought her,” he said. “To
question her about the Seanchan. I will be troubled by them again, I am afraid.”
The glint that had appeared in her eye vanished. She opened her mouth, but stopped, glancing at
Asmodean, when he raised a hand. He could all but see the questions about Seanchan piled up behind
her eyes. If he knew her, once begun she would not stop digging until she had uncovered scraps he did
not even remember he knew. Which might not be a bad thing. Another time. After he had wrung a few
answers out of Asmodean. She was right. He had to be hard.
“That was a smart thing you did,” she said, “hiding the hole I made. If a gai’shain had come in
here, a thousand of the spear-sisters might have marched through seeking you.”
Asmodean cleared his throat. “One of the gai’shain did come. Someone named Sulin had told
her she must see you eat, my Lord Dragon, and to stop her from bringing the tray in here and finding
you gone, I took the liberty of telling her that you and the young woman did not want to be disturbed.”
A slight tightening of his eyes caught Rand’s attention.
“What?”
“Just that she took it strangely. She laughed out loud and went running off. A few minutes later,
there must have been twenty Far Dareis Mai beneath the window, shouting and beating their spears
on their bucklers for a good hour or more. I must say, my Lord Dragon, some of the suggestions they
called up startled even me.”
Rand felt his cheeks burning—it had happened on the other side of the bloody world, and still
the Maidens knew!—but Aviendha only narrowed her eyes.
“Did she have hair and eyes like mine?” She did not wait for Asmodean’s nod. “It must have
been my first-sister Niella.” She saw the startled question on Rand’s face and answered it before he
could speak. “Niella is a weaver, not a Maiden, and she was taken half a year ago by Chareen
Maidens during a raid on Sulara Hold. She tried to talk me out of taking the spear, and she has always
wanted me wed. I am going to send her back to the Chareen with a welt on her bottom for every one
she told!”
Rand caught her arm as she started to stalk out of the room. “I want to talk with Natael. I don’t
suppose there is much time left until dawn . . .”
“Two hours, maybe,” Asmodean put in.
“. . . so there will be little sleeping now. If you want to try, would you mind making your bed
elsewhere for what’s left of the night? You need new blankets anyway.”
She nodded curtly before pulling loose, and slammed the door behind her. Surely she was not
angry at being tossed out of his bedchamber—how could she be; she had said nothing more would
happen between them—but he was glad he was not Niella.
Bouncing the shortened spear in his hand, he turned to Asmodean.
“A strange scepter, my Lord Dragon.”
“It will do for one.” To remind him that the Seanchan were still out there. For once he wished
his voice was even colder than the Void and saidin made it. He had to be hard. “Before I decide
whether to skewer you with it like a lamb, why did you never mention this trick of making something
invisible? If I hadn’t been able to see the flows, I’d never have known the gateway was still there.”
Asmodean swallowed, shifting as though he did not know whether Rand meant his threat. Rand
was not sure himself. “My Lord Dragon, you never asked. A matter of bending light. You always have
so many questions, it is hard to find a moment to speak of anything else. You must realize by now that
I’ve thrown my lot in with yours completely.” Licking his lips, he got up. As far as his knees. And
began to babble. “I felt your weave—anybody within a mile could have felt it—I never saw anything

like it—I didn’t know that anyone but Demandred could block a gateway that was closing, and maybe
Semirhage—and Lews Therin—I felt it, and came, and a hard time I had getting past those Maidens—
I used the same trick—you must know I am your man now. My Lord Dragon, I am your man.”
It was the repetition of what the Cairhienin had said that got through as much as anything else.
Gesturing with the half-spear, he said roughly, “Stand. You aren’t a dog.” But as Asmodean slowly
rose, he laid the long spearpoint alongside the man’s throat. He had to be hard. “From now on, you
will tell me two things I don’t ask about every time we talk. Every time, mind. If I think you are trying
to hide anything from me, you will be glad to let Semirhage have you.”
“As you say, my Lord Dragon,” Asmodean stammered. He looked ready to bow and kiss Rand’s
hand.
To avoid the chance, Rand moved to the blanketless bed and sat on the linen sheet, the feather
mattresses yielding under him as he studied the spear. A good idea to keep it for remembrance, if not
as a scepter. Even with everything else, he had best not forget the Seanchan. Those damane. If
Aviendha had not been there to block them from the Source . . .
“You have tried showing me how to shield a woman and failed. Try showing me how to avoid
flows I cannot see, how to counter them.” Once Lanfear had sliced his weavings as neatly as with a
knife.
“Not easy, my Lord Dragon, without a woman to practice against.”
“We have two hours,” Rand said coldly, letting the man’s shield unravel. “Try. Try very hard.”

CHAPTER
33

A Question of Crimson

The knife brushed Nynaeve’s hair as it thunked into the board she was leaning against, and she
flinched behind her blindfold. She wished she had a decent braid instead of locks hanging loose about
her shoulders. If that blade had cut even one strand . . . Fool woman, she thought bitterly. Fool, fool
woman. With the scarf folded over her eyes she could just see a narrow line of light at the bottom. It
seemed bright, from the darkness behind the thick folds. There had to be enough light yet, even if it
was late afternoon. Surely the man would not throw when he could not see properly. The next blade
struck on the other side of her head; she could feel it vibrating. She thought it almost touched her ear.
She was going to kill Thom Merrilin and Valan Luca. And maybe any other man she could get her
hands on, on sheer principle.
“The pears,” Luca shouted, as if he were not just thirty paces from her. He must think the
blindfold made her deaf as well as blind.
Fumbling in the pouch at her belt, she brought out a pear and carefully balanced it atop her head.
She was blind. A pure blind fool! Two more pears, and she gingerly extended her arms to either side
between the knives that outlined her, holding one in either hand by the stems. There was a pause. She
opened her mouth to tell Thom Merrilin that if he so much as nicked her, she would—
Tchunk-tchunk-tchunk! The blades came so fast she would have yelped if her throat had not
contracted like a fist. She held only the stem in her left hand, the other pear trembled faintly with the
knife through it, and the pear on her head leaked juice into her hair.
Snatching the scarf off, she stalked toward Thom and Luca, both of them grinning like maniacs.
Before she could speak one of the words boiling up in her, Luca said admiringly, “You are
magnificent, Nana. Your bravery is magnificent, but you are more so.” He swirled that ridiculous red
silk cloak in a bow, one hand over his heart. “I shall call this ‘Rose Among Thorns.’ Though truly,
you are more beautiful than any mere rose.”
“It doesn’t take much bravery to stand like a stump.” A rose, was she? She would show him
thorns. She would show both of them. “You listen to me, Valan Luca—”
“Such courage. You never even flinch. I tell you, I would not have the stomach to do what you
are doing.”
That was the simple truth, she told herself. “I am no braver than I have to be,” she said in a
milder tone. It was hard to shout at a man who insisted on telling you how brave you were. Certainly
better to hear than all that blather about roses. Thom knuckled his long white mustaches as if he saw
something funny.
“The dress,” Luca said, showing all of his teeth in a smile. “You will look wonderful in—”
“No!” she snapped. Whatever he had gained, he had just lost by bringing this up again. Clarine

had made the dress Luca wanted her to wear, in silk more crimson than his cloak. It was her opinion
that the color was to hide blood; if Thom’s hand slipped.
“But, Nana, beauty in danger is a great draw.” Luca’s voice crooned as if whispering sweetness
in her ear. “You will have every eye on you, every heart pounding for your beauty and courage.”
“If you like it so much,” she said firmly, “you wear it.” Aside from the color, she was not about
to show that much bosom in public, whether or not Clarine thought it was proper. She had seen
Latelle’s performing dress, all black spangles, with a high neck to her chin. She could wear
something like . . . What was she thinking? She had no intention of actually going through with this.
She had only agreed to this practice to stop Luca scratching at the wagon door every night to try
convincing her.
The man was nothing if not deft at knowing when to change the subject. “What happened here?”
he asked, suddenly all smooth solicitude.
She flinched as he touched her puffy eye. It was his bad luck to choose that. He would have done
better to continue trying to stuff her into that red dress. “I did not like the way it looked at me in the
mirror this morning, so I bit it.”
Her flat tone and bared teeth made Luca snatch his hand back. From the wary gleam in his dark
eyes, he suspected she might bite again. Thom was stroking his mustaches furiously, red in the face
from the effort of not laughing. He knew what had happened, of course. He would. And as soon as she
left, he would no doubt regale Luca with his version of events. Men could not avoid gossiping; it was
in them at birth, and nothing women could do ever got it out of them.
The daylight was dimmer than she had thought. The sun sat red on the treetops to the west. “If
you ever try this again without better light . . .” she growled, shaking a fist at Thom. “It’s almost
dusk!”
“I suppose,” the man said, bushy eyebrow lifting, “this means you want to leave out the bit
where I am blindfolded?” He was joking, of course. He had to be joking. “As you wish, Nana. From
now on, only in the most perfect light.”
It was not until she stalked away, swishing her skirts angrily, that she realized that she had
agreed to actually do this fool thing. By implication, at least. They would try to hold her to it, as
surely as the sun would set tonight. Fool, fool, fool woman!
The clearing where they—or Thom, at least, burn him and Luca both!—had been practicing
stood some little distance from the camp over beside the road north. Doubtless Luca had not wanted
to upset the animals should Thom put one of his knives through her heart. The man would likely have
fed her corpse to the lions. The only reason he wanted her to wear that dress was so he could ogle
what she had no intention of showing to anyone but Lan, and burn him, too, for a stubborn fool man.
She wished she had him there so she could tell him so. She wished she had him there so she could be
sure he was safe. She broke a dead dogfennel and used its feathery brown length like a whip to snap
the heads off weeds that poked through the leaves on the ground.
Last night, Elayne had said, Egwene reported fighting in Cairhien, skirmishes with brigands,
with Cairhienin who saw any Aiel as an enemy, with Andoran soldiers trying to claim the Sun Throne
for Morgase. Lan had been involved in them; whenever Moiraine let him out of her sight, he
apparently managed to take himself to the fighting, as if he could sense where it would be. Nynaeve
had never thought that she would want the Aes Sedai to keep Lan on a short leash at her side.
This morning Elayne had still been disturbed about her mother’s soldiers being in Cairhien,
fighting Rand’s Aiel, but what worried Nynaeve was the brigands. According to Egwene, if anyone
could identify stolen property in a brigand’s possession, if anyone could swear to seeing him kill

anyone or burn so much as a shed, Rand was hanging him. He did not put his hands on the rope, but it
was the same thing, and Egwene said he watched every execution with a face cold and hard as the
mountains. That was not like him. He had been a gentle boy. Whatever had happened to him in the
Waste had been very much for the worse.
Well, Rand was far away, and her own problems—hers and Elayne’s—were no nearer solution.
The River Eldar lay less than a mile north, spanned by a single lofty stone bridge built between tall
metal pillars that glistened without a speck of rust. Remnants of an earlier time, certainly, perhaps
even an earlier Age. She had gone up to it at midday, right after they arrived, but there had not been a
boat in the river worthy of the name. Rowboats, small fishing boats working along the reed-lined
banks, some strange, narrow little things that skittered over the water propelled by kneeling men with
paddles, even a squat barge that looked to be moored in mud—there seemed to be a lot of mud
showing on both sides, some of it dried hard and cracked, yet that was no wonder with the heat
holding on so unseasonably—but nothing that could carry them swiftly away downriver as she
wanted. Not that she knew where it was to take them, yet.
Rack her brains as she would, she could not remember the name of the town where the Blue
sisters were supposed to be. She swiped savagely at a scatterhead, and it burst in little white feathers
that floated to the ground. They probably were not there anymore in any case, if they ever had been.
But it was the only clue they had to a safe place short of Tear. If she could only remember it.
The only good thing on the entire journey north was that Elayne had stopped flirting with Thom.
There had not been an incident since joining the show. At least, it would have been good if Elayne
had not apparently decided to pretend nothing had ever happened. Yesterday Nynaeve had
congratulated the girl on coming to her senses, and Elayne had coolly replied, Are you trying to find
out if I will stand in your way with Thom, Nynaeve? He’s rather old for you, and I did think you
had planted your affections elsewhere, but you are old enough to make your own decisions. I am
fond of Thom, as I think he is of me. I look on him like a second father. If you want to flirt with
him, you have my permission. But I really did think you were more constant.
Luca meant to cross the river in the morning, and Samara, the town on the other side, in
Ghealdan, was no fit place to be. Luca had spent most of the day since their arrival over in Samara,
securing a place to set up his show. He was only concerned that a number of other menageries had
beaten him there, and he was not the only one to have more than animals. That was why he had grown
particularly insistent about her letting Thom throw knives at her. She was lucky he did not want it
done highwalking with Elayne. The man seemed to think the most important thing in the world was
that his show should be bigger and better than any other. For herself, the worrisome thing was that the
Prophet was in Samara, his followers crowding the town and spilling out into tents, huts and shanties
around it, a city that overwhelmed Samara’s own not inconsiderable size. It had a high stone wall,
and most of the buildings were stone as well, many as much as three stories, and there were more
roofs of slate or tile than thatch.
This side of the Eldar was no better. They had passed three Whitecloak encampments before
reaching their stopping place, hundreds of white tents in neat rows, and there had to be more they had
not seen. Whitecloaks on this side of the river, the Prophet and maybe a riot waiting to happen on the
other, and she had no idea where to go and no way to get there except in a lumbering wagon that
moved no faster than she could walk. She wished she had never let Elayne talk her into abandoning
the coach. Not seeing a weed close enough to snap without stepping aside, she broke the dogfennel in
half, then again, until the pieces were no longer than her hand, and tossed them to the ground. She
wished she could do the same with Luca. And Galad Damodred, for sending them running here. And

al’Lan Mandragoran, for not being here. Not that she needed him, of course. But his presence would
have been . . . a comfort.
The camp was quiet, with evening meals cooking over small fires beside the wagons. Petra was
feeding the black-maned lion, thrusting huge pieces of meat through the bars on a stick. The female
lions were already hunkered down over theirs companionably, letting out an occasional growl if
someone came too close to their cage. Nynaeve stopped near Aludra’s wagon; the Illuminator was
working with wooden mortar and pestle on a table let down from the side of her wagon, muttering to
herself over whatever she was compounding. Three of the Chavanas smiled at Nynaeve enticingly,
motioning her to join them. Not Brugh, who still glowered over his lip, though she had given him a
salve to make the swelling go down. Maybe if she hit the rest of them as hard, they would listen to
Luca—and more importantly, to her!—and realize that she did not want their smiles. Too bad Master
Valan Luca could not follow his own instructions. Latelle turned from the bear cage and gave her a
tight smile; more of a smirk, really. Mainly, though, Nynaeve stared at Cerandin, who was filing the
blunt toenails of one of the huge gray s’redit with what looked like a tool suitable for metal.
“That one,” Aludra said, “she uses the hands and the feet with remarkable ability, no? Do not
glare at me so, Nana,” she added, dusting her hands. “I am not your enemy. Here. You must try these
new firesticks.”
Nynaeve took the wooden box from the dark-haired woman gingerly. It was a cube she could
have held easily with one hand, but she used both. “I thought you called them strikers.”
“Maybe yes, maybe no. Firesticks, it says what they are much better than strikers, yes? I have
smoothed the little holes that hold the sticks so they can no longer ignite on the wood. A good idea,
no? And the heads, they are a new formulation. You will try them and tell me what you think?”
“Yes, of course. Thank you.”
Nynaeve hurried on before the woman could press another box on her. She held the thing as if it
might explode, which she was not certain it would not. Aludra had everyone trying out her strikers, or
firesticks, or whatever she would decide to call them next. They certainly would light a fire or a
lamp. They could also burst into flame if the blue-gray heads rubbed against each other or anything
else rough. For herself, she would stick with flint and steel, or a coal kept properly banked in a box
of sand. Much safer.
Juilin caught her before she could set foot on the steps of the wagon she shared with Elayne, his
gaze going straight to her swollen eye. She glared at him so hard that he stepped back and snatched
that ridiculous conical cap from his head. “I’ve been over the river,” he said. “There are a hundred or
so Whitecloaks in Samara. Just watching, and being watched as hard themselves by Ghealdanin
soldiers. But I recognized one. The young fellow who was sitting across from The Light of Truth in
Sienda.”
She smiled at him, and he took another hasty step back, eyeing her warily. Galad in Samara. That
was all they needed. “You always bring such wonderful news, Juilin. We should have left you in
Tanchico, or better, on the dock in Tear.” That was hardly fair. Better he told her of Galad than that
she walked around a corner into the man. “Thank you, Juilin. At least we know to keep an eye out for
him, now.” His nod was hardly a proper response to graciously offered thanks, and he hurried away,
clapping his hat on, as if he expected her to hit him. Men had no manners.
The interior of the wagon was far cleaner than it had been when Thom and Juilin purchased it.
The flaking paint had all been scraped off—the men had grumbled about doing that—and the cabinets
and the tiny table that was fastened to the floor oiled until they shone. The small brick stove with its
metal chimney was never used—the nights were warm enough, and if they began cooking in here,

Thom and Juilin would never take another turn—but it made a good place to keep their valuables, the
purses and the jewelry boxes. The washleather pouch holding the seal—that she had stuffed in as far
as it would go and had not touched since.
Elayne, seated on one of the narrow beds, stuffed something under the blankets when Nynaeve
climbed inside, but before she could ask what it was, Elayne exclaimed, “Your eye! What happened
to you?” They needed to wash her hair in henpepper again; faint hints of gold were showing at the
roots of those black tresses. It had to be done every few days.
“Cerandin hit me when I wasn’t looking,” Nynaeve muttered. The remembered taste of boiled
catfern and powdered mavinsleaf made her tongue curl. That was not why she had let Elayne go to the
last meeting in Tel’aran’rhiod, too. She was not avoiding Egwene. It was just that she made most of
the journeys into the World of Dreams between meetings, and it was only fair to give Elayne her
chances to go. That was it.
Carefully she put the box of firesticks into one of the cabinets, next to two more. The one that had
actually caught fire was long since discarded.
She did not know why she was hiding the truth. Elayne had obviously not been outside the
wagon, or she would know already. She and Juilin were probably the only people in camp who did
not know, now that Thom had surely revealed every disgusting detail to Luca.
Taking a deep breath, she sat down on the other bed and made herself meet Elayne’s eyes.
Something in the quiet of the other woman said she knew that more was coming.
“I . . . asked Cerandin about damane and sul’dam. I am certain she knows more than she lets
on.” She paused for Elayne to voice doubts that she had asked rather than demanded, to say that the
Seanchan woman had already told them all she knew, that she had not had much contact with damane
or sul’dam. But Elayne kept silent, and Nynaeve realized that she was only hoping to postpone the
moment with an argument. “She got quite heated about not knowing any more, so I shook her. You’ve
really gone too far with her. She waggled her finger under my nose!” Still Elayne only watched her,
those cool blue eyes barely blinking. It was all Nynaeve could do not to look away as she went on.
“She . . . threw me, somehow, over her shoulder. I got up and slapped her, and she knocked me down
with her fist. That is how I got the eye.” She might as well tell the rest; Elayne would hear soon
enough; better it came from her. She would rather have pulled out her tongue. “I wasn’t about to put
up with that, certainly. We scuffled a little more.” Not much of a scuffle on her part, for all that she
had refused to quit. The bitterest truth was that Cerandin had only stopped flipping her about and
tripping her in sneaky ways because it had been like manhandling a child. Nynaeve had had as much
chance as that child. If only no one had been watching, so she could have channeled; she had certainly
been angry enough. If only no one had been watching, period. She wished Cerandin had pounded her
with her fists until she bled. “Then Latelle gave her a stick. You know how that woman wants to get
back at me.” There was certainly no need to say that Cerandin had been holding her head down over a
wagon tongue at the time. No one had manhandled her like that since she threw a pitcher of water at
Neysa Ayellin when she was sixteen. “Anyway, Petra broke it up.” Just in time, too. The huge man
had taken the pair of them by the scruff of the neck like kittens. “Cerandin apologized, and that was
that.” Petra had made the Seanchan woman apologize, true, but he had made Nynaeve do so as well,
refusing to loose that gentle yet iron-hard grip on her neck until she did. She had hit him as hard as she
could, right in the stomach, and he had not even blinked. Her hand felt as if it might swell, too.
“Nothing much to it, really. I suppose Latelle will try to spread some story of her own making about
it. That is the woman I ought to shake. I didn’t hit her half hard enough.”
She felt better for telling the truth, but Elayne had doubt on her face that made her want to change

the subject. “What is that you’re hiding?” She reached over and pulled the blanket back, revealing the
silvery length of the a’dam they had gotten from Cerandin. “Why under the Light do you want to look
at that? And if you do, why hide it? It is a filthy thing, and I cannot understand how you can touch it,
but if you want to, that is entirely up to you.”
“Don’t sound so prim,” Elayne told her. A slow smile broke across her face, a flush of
excitement. “I think I could make one.”
“Make one!” Nynaeve lowered her voice, hoping no one came running to see who was killing
whom, but she did not soften it any. “Light, why? Make an open cesspit first. A midden heap. At least
there’s some decent use for those.”
“I do not mean to actually make an a’dam.” Elayne held herself erect, chin tilted in that cool way
of hers. She sounded offended, and icily calm. “But it is a ter’angreal, and I have puzzled out how it
works. I saw you attend at least one lecture on linking. The a’dam links the two women; that is why
the sul’dam must be a woman who can channel, too.” She frowned slightly. “It is a strange link,
though. Different. Instead of two or more sharing, with one guiding, it is one taking full control, really.
I think that is the reason a damane cannot do anything the sul’dam doesn’t want her to. I don’t really
believe there is any need for the leash. The collar and bracelet would work as well without it, and in
just the same ways.”
“Work as well,” Nynaeve said dryly. “You’ve studied the matter a great deal for someone who
has no intention of making one.” The woman did not even have the grace to blush. “What use would
you put it to? I cannot say I would take it amiss if you put one around Elaida’s neck, but that doesn’t
make it any less disgus—”
“Don’t you understand?” Elayne broke in, haughtiness all gone in excitement and fervor. She
leaned forward to put a hand on Nynaeve’s knee, and her eyes shone, she was so delighted with
herself. “It is a ter’angreal, Nynaeve. And I think I can make one.” She said each word slowly and
deliberately, then laughed and rushed on. “If I can make this one, I can make others. Maybe I can even
make angreal and sa’angreal. No one in the Tower has been able to do that in thousands of years!”
Straightening, she shivered, and laid fingers across her mouth. “I never really thought of making
anything myself before. Not anything useful. I remember seeing a craftsman once, a man who had
made some chairs for the palace. They were not gilded, or elaborately carved—they were meant for
the servants’ hall—but I could see the pride in his eyes. Pride in what he had made, a thing well
crafted. I would love to feel that, I think. Oh, if we only knew a fraction of what the Forsaken do. The
knowledge of the Age of Legends inside their heads, and they use it to serve the Shadow. Think what
we could do with it. Think what we could make.” She took a deep breath, dropping her hands in her
lap, her enthusiasm barely diminished. “Well, be that as it may, I’ll wager I could puzzle out how
Whitebridge was made, too. Buildings like spun glass, but stronger than steel. And cuendillar, and
—”
“Slow down,” Nynaeve said. “Whitebridge is five or six hundred miles from here at least, and if
you think you’re going to go channeling at the seal, you can think again. Who knows what could
happen? It stays in its pouch, in the stove, until we find somewhere safe for it.”
Elayne’s eagerness was very odd. Nynaeve would not have minded a little of the Forsaken’s
knowledge herself—far from it—but if she wanted a chair, she paid a carpenter. She had never
wanted to make anything, aside from poultices and salves. When she was twelve, her mother had
stopped going through the motions of teaching her to sew, after it became apparent that she did not
care whether she sewed a straight seam and could not be made to care. As for cooking . . . She
thought she was a good cook, actually, but the point was that she knew what was significant. Healing

was important. Any man could build a bridge, and leave him to it was what she said.
“With you and your a’dam,” she went on, “I nearly forgot to tell you. Juilin saw Galad on the
other side of the river.”
“Blood and bloody ashes,” Elayne muttered, and when Nynaeve raised her eyebrows, she added
very firmly, “I will not listen to a lecture on my language, Nynaeve. What are we going to do?”
“As I see it, we can remain on this side of the river and have Whitecloaks looking us over,
wondering why we left the menagerie, or we can cross the bridge and hope the Prophet doesn’t spark
a riot and Galad doesn’t denounce us, or we can try to buy a rowboat and flee downriver. Not very
good choices. And Luca will want his hundred marks. Gold.” She tried not to scowl, but that still
rankled. “You promised it to him, and I suppose it would not be honest to sneak away without paying
him.” She would have done it in a minute if there was anywhere to go.
“It certainly would not be,” Elayne said, sounding shocked. “But we do not have to worry about
Galad, at least not as long as we stay close to the menagerie. Galad won’t go near one. He thinks
putting animals in cages is cruel. He doesn’t mind hunting them, mind, or eating them, only caging
them.”
Nynaeve shook her head. The truth was that Elayne would have found some way to delay, if only
for one day, had there been any way to leave. The woman really wanted to highwalk in front of
people other than the rest of the performers. And she herself was probably going to have to let Thom
throw knives at her again. I am not wearing that bloody dress, though!
“The first boat that comes large enough to take four people,” she said. “We are hiring it. Trade
on the river can’t have stopped altogether.”
“It would help if we knew where we were going.” The other woman’s tone was much too gentle.
“We could simply head for Tear, you know. We do not have to stay fixed to this just because you . . .”
She trailed off, but Nynaeve knew what she had been going to say. Just because she was stubborn.
Just because she was so furious that she could not remember a simple name that she intended to
remember it and go there if it killed her. Well, none of that was true. She intended to find these Aes
Sedai who might just support Rand and bring them to him, not trail into Tear like a pitiful refugee
fleeing for safety.
“I will remember,” she said in a level tone. It ended with “bar.” Or was it “dar”? “Lar”?
“Before you are tired of flaunting yourself highwalking, I will.” I will not wear that dress!

CHAPTER

A Silver Arrow

Elayne had the cooking that evening, which meant that none of the food was simple, despite the
fact that they were eating on stools around a cookfire, with crickets chirping in the surrounding
woods, and now and again some night-bird’s thin, sad cry in the deepening darkness. The soup was
served cold and jellied, with chopped green ferris sprinkled on top. The Light knew where she had
found ferris, or the tiny onions she put in with the peas. The beef was sliced nearly thin enough to see
through and wrapped around something made from carrots, sweetbeans, chives and goatcheese, and
there was even a small honeycake for dessert.
It was all tasty, though Elayne fretted that nothing was exactly the way it should be, as if she
thought she could duplicate the cooks’ work in the Royal Palace in Caemlyn. Nynaeve was fairly sure
the girl was not fishing for compliments. Elayne would always brush away compliments and tell you
exactly what was not right: Thom and Juilin grumbled about there being so little beef, but Nynaeve
noticed that they not only ate every scrap but looked disappointed when the last pea was gone. When
she cooked, for some reason they always seemed to eat at one of the other wagons. When one of them
made supper, it was always stew or else meat and beans so full of dried peppers that your tongue
blistered.
They did not eat alone, of course. Luca saw to that, bringing his own stool and placing it right
next to her, his red cloak spread to best effect and his long legs stretched out so that his calves
showed well, above his turned-down boots. He was there almost every night. Oddly, the only nights
he missed were when she cooked.
It was interesting, really, having his eyes on her when a woman as pretty as Elayne was there,
but he did have his motives. He sat altogether too close—tonight she moved her stool three times, but
he followed without missing a word or seeming to notice—and he alternated comparing her with
various flowers, to the blossoms’ detriment, ignoring the black eye he could not miss without being
blind, and musing over how beautiful she would be in that red dress, with compliments on her
courage thrown in. Twice, he slipped in suggestions that they take a stroll by moonlight, hints so
veiled that she was not entirely sure that was what they were until she thought about it.
“That gown will frame your unfolding bravery to perfection,” he murmured in her ear, “yet not a
quarter so well as you display yourself, for night-blooming dara lilies would weep with envy to see
you stroll beside the moonlit water, as I would do, and make myself a bard to sing your praises by
this very moon.”
She blinked at him, working that out. Luca seemed to believe she was fluttering her lashes; she
accidentally hit him in the ribs with her elbow before he could nibble her ear. At least that seemed to
be his intention, even if he was coughing now and claiming he had swallowed a cake crumb the

wrong way. The man was certainly handsome—Stop that!—and he did have a shapely calf—What
are you doing, looking at his legs?—but he must think her a brainless ninny. It was all in aid of his
bloody show.
She moved her stool again while he was trying to get his breath back; she could not move it far
without making it clear that she was running from him, though she held her fork ready in case he
followed again. Thom studied his plate as though more than a smear remained on the white glaze.
Juilin whistled tunelessly and nearly silently, peering into the dying fire with false intensity. Elayne
looked at her and shook her head.
“It was so pleasant of you to join us,” Nynaeve said, and stood up. Luca stood when she did, a
hopeful look in his eye along with the shine of the firelight. She set her plate atop the one in his hand.
“Thom and Juilin will be grateful for your help with the dishes, I am sure.” Before his mouth finished
falling open, she turned to Elayne. “It is late, and I expect we’ll be moving across the river early.”
“Of course,” Elayne murmured, with just the hint of a smile. And she put her plate atop
Nynaeve’s before following her into the wagon. Nynaeve wanted to hug her. Until she said, “Really,
you should not encourage him.” Lamps mounted in wall brackets sprang alight.
Nynaeve planted her fists on her hips. “Encourage him! The only way I could encourage him
less would be to stab him!” Sniffing for emphasis, she frowned at the lamps. “Next time, use one of
Aludra’s firesticks. Strikers. You are going to forget one day and channel where you shouldn’t, and
then where will we be? Running for our lives with a hundred Whitecloaks after us.”
Stubborn to a fault, the other woman refused to be diverted. “I may be younger than you, but
sometimes I think I know more of men than you ever will. For a man like Valan Luca, that coy little
flight of yours tonight was only asking him to keep pursuing you. If you would snap his nose off the
way you did the first day, he might give up. You don’t tell him to stop, you do not even ask! You kept
smiling at him, Nynaeve. What is the man supposed to think? You haven’t smiled at anyone in days!”
“I am trying to hold my temper,” Nynaeve muttered. Everybody complained about her temper,
and now that she was trying to control it, Elayne complained about that! It was not that she was fool
enough to be taken in by his compliments. She certainly was not so big a fool as that. Elayne laughed
at her, and she scowled.
“Oh, Nynaeve. ‘You cannot hold the sun down at dawn.’ Lini could have been thinking of you.”
With an effort Nynaeve smoothed her face. She could too hold her temper. Didn’t I just prove it
out there? She held out her hand. “Let me have the ring. He will want to cross the river early
tomorrow, and I want at least some real sleep after I’m done.”
“I thought I would go tonight.” Concern touched Elayne’s voice. “Nynaeve, you’ve been entering
Tel’aran’rhiod practically every night except the meetings with Egwene. That Bair intends to pick a
bone with you, by the way. I had to tell them why you weren’t there yet again, and she says you should
not need rest however often you enter, unless you are doing something wrong.” Concern became
firmness, and the younger woman planted her fists on her hips. “I had to listen to a lecture that was
meant for you, and it was not pleasant, with Egwene standing there nodding her head to every word.
Now, I really think that tonight I should—”
“Please, Elayne.” Nynaeve did not lower her outstretched hand. “I have questions for Birgitte,
and her answers might make me think of more.” She did have, sort of; she could always think of
questions for Birgitte. It had nothing to do with avoiding Egwene, and the Wise Ones. If she visited
Tel’aran’rhiod so often that Elayne always went to the meetings with Egwene, that was simply how it
fell out.
Elayne sighed, but fished the twisted stone ring from the neck of her dress. “Ask her again,

Nynaeve. It is very difficult facing Egwene. She saw Birgitte. She doesn’t say anything, but she looks
at me. It is worse when we meet again after the Wise Ones have gone. She could ask then, and she
still doesn’t, and that makes it far worse.” She frowned as Nynaeve transferred the small ter’angreal
to the leather cord around her own neck, with Lan’s heavy ring and her Great Serpent. “Why do you
suppose none of the Wise Ones ever come with her then? We don’t learn very much in Elaida’s study,
but you would think they would at least want to see the Tower. Egwene doesn’t even want to talk
about it in front of them. If I seem to come close, she gives me such a look that you’d think she meant
to hit me.”
“I think they want to avoid the Tower as much as possible.” And wise they were indeed for that.
If not for Healing, she would avoid it, and Aes Sedai, too. She was not becoming Aes Sedai; she was
just hoping to learn more of Healing. And to help Rand, certainly. “They are free women, Elayne.
Even if the Tower was not in the mess it is, would they really want Aes Sedai traipsing through the
Waste, scooping them up to carry back to Tar Valon?”
“I suppose that is it.” Elayne’s tone said she could not understand it, though. She thought the
Tower wonderful, and could not see why any woman would want to evade Aes Sedai. Sealed to the
White Tower forever, they said when they put that ring on your finger. And they meant it. Yet the fool
girl did not see it as onerous at all.
Elayne helped her undress, and she stretched out on her narrow bed in her shift, yawning. It had
been a long day, and it was surprising how tiring standing still could be when someone unseen was
hurling knives at you. Idle thoughts drifted through her head as she closed her eyes. Elayne had
claimed she was practicing when she had acted the fool with Thom. Not that the fond-father-andfavorite-daughter they tried on now was much less foolish to watch. Maybe she could practice
herself, just a bit, with Valan. Now, that was foolish. Men’s eyes might wander—Lan’s had better
not!—but she knew how to be constant. She was simply not going to wear that dress. Far too much
bosom.
Vaguely, she heard Elayne say, “Remember to ask her again.”
Sleep took her.
She stood outside the wagon, in the night. The moon was high, and drifting clouds cast shadows
over the camp. Crickets chirruped, and the night-birds called. The lions’ eyes shone as they watched
her from their cages. The white-faced bears were dark sleeping mounds behind the iron bars. The
long picket line stood empty of horses, Clarine’s dogs were not on their leashes beneath her and
Petra’s wagon, and the space where the s’redit stood in the waking world was bare. She had come to
understand that only wild creatures had reflections here, but whatever the Seanchan woman claimed,
it was hard to think that those huge gray animals had been domesticated so long that they were no
longer wild.
Abruptly she realized that she was wearing the dress. Blazing red, far too snug around the hips
for decency, and a square neck cut so low she thought she might pop out. She could not imagine any
woman but Berelain donning it. For Lan, she might. If they were alone. Shehad been thinking of Lan
when she drifted off. I was, wasn’t I?
In any case, she was not about to let Birgitte see her in the thing. The woman claimed to be a
soldier, and the more time Nynaeve spent with her, the more she realized that some of her attitudes—
and comments—were as bad as any man’s. Worse. A combination of Berelain and a tavern brawler.
The comments did not come out all the time, but they certainly did whenever Nynaeve allowed idle
thoughts to put her in anything like this dress. She changed to good stout Two Rivers wool, dark, with

a plain shawl she did not need, her hair decently braided again, and opened her mouth to call Birgitte.
“Why did you change?” the woman said, stepping out from the shadows to lean on her silver
bow. Her intricate golden braid hung over her shoulder, and moonlight shone on her bow and arrows.
“I remember wearing a gown that could have been twin to that, once. It was only to attract attention so
Gaidal could sneak by—the guards’ eyes bulged like frogs’—but it was fun. Especially when I wore
it dancing with him later. He always hates dancing, but he was so intent on keeping any other man
from getting close that he danced every dance.” Birgitte laughed fondly. “I won fifty gold solids from
him that night at spin, because he stared so much he never looked at his tiles. Men are peculiar. It was
not as if he had never seen me—”
“That’s as may be,” Nynaeve cut in primly, wrapping the shawl firmly around her shoulders.
Before she could add her question, Birgitte said, “I have found her,” and all thought of the
question fled.
“Where? Did she see you? Can you take me to her? Without her seeing?” Fear fluttered in
Nynaeve’s belly—a fat lot Valan Luca would say about her courage if he could see her now—but she
was sure it would turn to anger as soon as she saw Moghedien. “If you can bring me close . . .” She
trailed off as Birgitte raised a hand.
“I cannot think she saw me, or I doubt I would be here now.” She was all seriousness now;
Nynaeve found it much easier to be around her when she showed this side of being a soldier. “I can
take you close for a moment, if you want to go, but she is not alone. At least . . . You will see. You
must be silent, and you must take no action against Moghedien. There are other Forsaken. Perhaps you
could destroy her, but can you destroy five of them?”
The fluttering in Nynaeve’s middle spread to her chest. And her knees. Five. She should ask
what Birgitte had seen or heard and let it go at that. Then she could return to her bed and . . . But
Birgitte was looking at her. Not questioning her courage, only looking. Ready to do this thing if she
said. “I will be silent. And I won’t even think of channeling.” Not with five Forsaken together. Not
that she could have channeled a spark at that moment. She stiffened her knees to keep them from
knocking. “Whenever you are ready.”
Birgitte hefted her bow and put a hand on Nynaeve’s arm . . .
. . . and Nynaeve’s breath caught in her throat. They were standing on nothing, infinite blackness
all around, no way to tell up from down, and in every direction a fall that would last forever. Head
spinning, she made herself look where Birgitte pointed.
Below them, Moghedien also stood on darkness, garbed nearly as black as what surrounded her,
bent and listening intently. And as far below her, four huge, high-backed chairs, each different, sat on
an expanse of glistening white-tiled floor floating in the blackness. Strangely, Nynaeve could hear
what those in the chairs said as well as if she had been among them.
“. . . never been a coward,” a plumply pretty, sun-haired woman was saying, “so why begin?”
Seemingly attired in silvery-gray mist and sparkling gems, she lounged in a chair of ivory worked so
it appeared made of naked acrobats. Four carved men held it aloft, and her arms rested along the
backs of kneeling women; two men and two women held a white silk cushion behind her head, while
above more were contorted into shapes Nynaeve did not believe a human body could attain. She
blushed when she realized that some were performing more than acrobatic tricks.
A compact man of middling height, with a livid scar across his face and a square golden beard,
leaned forward angrily. His chair was heavy wood, carved with columns of armored men and horses,
a steel-gauntleted fist clasping lighting at the back’s peak. His red coat made up for the lack of gilding
on the chair, for golden scrollwork rolled across his shoulders and down his arms. “No one names

me coward,” he said harshly. “But if we continue as we are, he will come straight for my throat.”
“That has been the plan from the beginning,” said a woman’s melodious voice. Nynaeve could
not see the speaker, hidden behind the towering back of a chair that seemed all snow-white stone and
silver.
The second man was large and darkly handsome, with white wings streaking his temples. He
toyed with an ornate golden goblet, leaning back in a throne. That was the only possible word for the
gem-encrusted thing; a mere hint of gold showed here and there, but Nynaeve would not have doubted
that it was solid gold beneath all those glittering rubies and emeralds and moonstones; it had an air of
weight quite apart from its massive size. “He will concentrate on you,” the big man said in a deep
voice. “If need be, one close to him will die, plainly at your order. He will come for you. And while
he is fixed on you alone, the three of us, linked, will take him. What has changed to alter any of that?”
“Nothing has changed,” the scarred man growled. “Least of all, my trust for you. I will be part of
the link, or it ends now.”
The golden-haired woman threw back her head and laughed. “Poor man,” she said mockingly,
waving a beringed hand at him. “Do you think he would not notice that you were linked? He has a
teacher, remember. A poor one, but not a complete fool. Next you will ask to include enough of those
Black Ajah children to take the circle beyond thirteen, so you or Rahvin must have control.”
“If Rahvin trusts us enough to link when he must allow one of us to guide,” the melodious voice
said, “you can display an equal trust.” The big man looked into his goblet, and the mist-clad woman
smiled faintly. “If you cannot trust us not to turn on you,” the unseen woman continued, “then trust that
we will be watching each other too closely to turn. You agreed to all of this, Sammael. Why do you
begin to quibble now?”
Nynaeve gave a start as Birgitte touched her arm . . .
. . . and they were back among the wagons, with the moon shining through the clouds. It seemed
almost normal compared to where they had been.
“Why . . . ?” Nynaeve began, and had to swallow. “Why did you bring us away?” Her heart
leaped into her throat. “Did Moghedien see us?” She had been so intent on the other Forsaken—on the
mingled strangeness and commonplaceness of them—that she had forgotten to keep an eye on
Moghedien. She heaved a fervent sigh when Birgitte shook her head.
“I never took my gaze from her for more than a moment, and she never moved a muscle. But I do
not like being so exposed. If she had looked up, or one of the others . . .”
Nynaeve wrapped her shawl tightly around her shoulders and still shivered. “Rahvin and
Sammael.” She wished she did not sound hoarse. “Did you recognize the others?” Of course Birgitte
had; it was a foolish way to phrase it, but she was shaken.
“Lanfear was the one hidden by her chair. The other was Graendal. Do not think her a fool
because she lolls in a chair that would make a Senje no-room keeper blush. She is devious, and she
uses her pets in rites to cause the roughest soldier I ever knew to swear celibacy.”
“Graendal is devious,” Moghedien’s voice said, “but not devious enough.”
Birgitte whirled, silver bow coming up, silver arrow almost flying to nock—and abruptly
hurtled thirty paces through the moonlight to crash against Nynaeve’s wagon so hard that she bounced
back five and lay in a crumpled heap.
Desperately Nynaeve reached for saidar. Fear streaked through her anger, but there was anger
enough—and it ran into an invisible wall between her and the warm glow of the True Source. She
almost howled. Something seized her feet, jerking them backward and up off the ground; her hands
flew up and back until wrists met ankles above her head. Her clothes became powder that slid from

her skin, and her braid dragged her head back until the braid rested on her bottom. Frantic, she tried
to step out of the dream. Nothing happened. She hung doubled in midair like some netted creature,
every muscle strained to its limit. Tremors ran through her; her fingers twitched feebly, brushing her
feet. She thought if she tried to move anything else, her back would break.
Strangely, her fear was gone, now that it was too late. She was certain that she could have been
quick enough, if not for the terror that had laced through her when she needed to act. All she wanted
was a chance to put her hands around Moghedien’s throat. Much good that does now! Every breath
came in strained panting.
Moghedien moved to where Nynaeve could see her, between the quivering triangle of her arms.
The glow of saidar surrounded the woman mockingly. “A detail from Graendal’s chair,” the
Forsaken said. Her dress was mist like Graendal’s, sliding from black fog to nearly transparent and
back to gleaming silver. The fabric changed almost constantly. Nynaeve had seen her wear it before,
in Tanchico. “Not something I would have thought of on my own, but Graendal can be . . . edifying.”
Nynaeve glared at her, but Moghedien did not appear to notice. “I can hardly believe that you actually
came hunting me. Did you really believe that because once you were lucky enough to catch me off
guard, you might be my equal?” The woman’s laugh was cutting. “If you only knew the effort I have
put into finding you. And you came to me.” She glanced around at the wagons, studying the lions and
bears for a moment before turning back to Nynaeve. “A menagerie? That would make you easy
enough to find. If I needed to, now.”
“Do your worst, burn you,” Nynaeve snarled. As best she could. Doubled up as she was, she had
to force the words out one by one. She did not dare look straight toward Birgitte—not that she could
have shifted her head enough to—but rolling her eyes as if caught between fury and fear, she caught a
glimpse. Her stomach went hollow, even stretched tight as a sheepskin for drying. Birgitte lay
sprawled on the ground, silver arrows spilling from the quiver at her waist, her silver bow a span
from her unmoving hand. “Lucky, you say? If you hadn’t managed to sneak up on me, I’d have striped
you till you wailed. I’d have wrung your neck like a chicken.” She had only one chance, if Birgitte
was dead, and a bleak one. To make Moghedien so angry that she killed her quickly in a rage. If only
there was some way to warn Elayne. Her dying would have to do it. “Remember how you said you’d
use me for a mounting block? And later, when I said I’d do the same for you? That was after I had
beaten you. When you were whimpering and pleading for your life. Offering me anything. You are a
gutless coward! The leavings from a nightjar! You piece of—!” Something thick crawled into her
mouth, flattening her tongue and forcing her jaws wide.
“You are so simple,” Moghedien murmured. “Believe me, I am quite angry enough with you
already. I do not think I will use you for a mounting block.” Her smile made Nynaeve’s skin crawl. “I
think I will turn you into a horse. It is quite possible, here. A horse, a mouse, a frog . . .” She paused,
listening. “. . . a cricket. And every time you come to Tel’aran’rhiod, you’ll be a horse, until I change
it. Or some other with the knowledge does so.” She paused again, looking almost sympathetic. “No,
I’d not want to give you false hope. There are only nine of us now who know that binding, and you
would not want any of the others to have you any more than myself. You will be a horse every time I
bring you here. You will have your own saddle and bridle. I will even braid your mane.” Nynaeve’s
braid jerked almost out of her scalp. “You will remember who you are even then, of course. I think I
will enjoy our rides, though you may not.” Moghedien took a deep breath, and her dress darkened to
something that glistened in the pale light; Nynaeve could not be sure, but she thought it might be the
color of wet blood. “You make me approach Semirhage. It will be well to be done with you, so I can
turn my full attention to matters of importance. Is the little yellow-haired chit with you in this

menagerie?”
The thickness vanished from Nynaeve’s mouth. “I am alone, you stupid—” Pain. As if she had
been beaten from ankles to shoulders, every stroke landing at once. She bellowed shrilly. Again. She
tried to clamp her teeth shut, but her own endless shriek filled her ears. Tears rolled shamingly down
her cheeks as she sobbed, waiting hopelessly for the next.
“Is she with you?” Moghedien said patiently. “Do not waste time trying to make me kill you. I
won’t. You will live many years serving me. Your rather pitiful abilities might be of some use once I
train them. Once I train you. But I can make you think that what you just felt was a lover’s caress.
Now, answer my question.”
Nynaeve managed to gather breath. “No,” she wept. “She ran off with a man after we left
Tanchico. A man old enough to be her grandfather, but he had money. We heard what happened in the
Tower”—she was sure Moghedien must know of that—“and she was afraid to go back.”
The other woman laughed. “A delightful tale. I can almost see what fascinates Semirhage about
breaking the spirit. Oh, you are going to provide me with a great deal of entertainment, Nynaeve
al’Meara. But first, you are going to bring the girl Elayne to me. You will shield her and bind her and
bring her to lie at my feet. Do you know why? Because some things are actually stronger in
Tel’aran’rhiod than in the waking world. That is why you will be a glossy white mare whenever I
bring you here. And it is not only hurts taken here that last into waking. Compulsion is another. I want
you to think of it for a moment or two, before you begin believing it your own idea. I suspect that the
girl is your friend. But you are going to bring her to me like a pet—” Moghedien screamed as a silver
arrow suddenly stuck its head out from below her right breast.
Nynaeve fell to the ground like a dropped sack. The fall knocked every speck of breath from her
lungs as surely as a hammer in the belly. Straining to breathe, she struggled to make racked muscles
move, to fight through pain to saidar.
Staggering on her feet, Birgitte fumbled another arrow from her quiver. “Go, Nynaeve!” It was a
mumbling shout. “Get away!” Birgitte’s head wavered, and the silver bow wobbled as she raised it.
The glow around Moghedien increased until it seemed as if the blinding sun surrounded her.
The night folded in over Birgitte like an ocean wave, enveloping her in blackness. When it
passed, the bow dropped atop empty clothes as they collapsed. The clothes faded like fog burning off,
and only the bow and arrows remained, shining in the moonlight.
Moghedien sank to her knees, panting, clutching the protruding arrow shaft with both hands as
the glow around her faded and died. Then she vanished, and the silver arrow fell where she had been,
stained dark with blood.
After what seemed an eternity, Nynaeve managed to push up to hands and knees. Weeping, she
crawled to Birgitte’s bow. This time it was not pain that made tears come. Kneeling, naked and not
caring, she clutched the bow. “I’m sorry,” she sobbed. “Oh, Birgitte, forgive me. Birgitte!”
There was no answer except the mournful cry of a night-bird.
Liandrin leaped to her feet as the door to Moghedien’s bedchamber crashed open and the Chosen
staggered into the sitting room, blood soaking her silk shift. Chesmal and Temaile rushed to her side,
each taking an arm to keep the woman on her feet, but Liandrin remained by her chair. The others
were out; perhaps out of Amador, for all Liandrin knew. Moghedien told only what she wanted the
hearer to know, and punished questions she did not like.
“What happened?” Temaile gasped.
Moghedien’s brief look should have fried her where she stood. “You have some small ability

with Healing,” the Chosen told Chesmal thickly. Blood stained her lips, trickled from the corner of
her mouth in an increasing stream. “Do it. Now, fool!”
The dark-haired Ghealdanin woman did not hesitate in laying hands to Moghedien’s head.
Liandrin sneered to herself as the glow surrounded Chesmal; concern painted Chesmal’s handsome
face, and Temaile’s delicate, foxlike features were contorted with pure fright and worry. So faithful,
they were. Such obedient lapdogs. Moghedien lifted up onto her toes, head flung back; eyes wide, she
shook, breath rushing from her gaping mouth as if she had been plunged into ice.
In moments it was done. The glow around Chesmal disappeared, and Moghedien’s heels settled
to the blue-and-green-patterned carpet. Without Temaile’s support, she might have fallen. Only a part
of the strength for Healing came from the Power; the rest came from the person being Healed.
Whatever wound had caused all that bleeding would be gone, but Moghedien was surely as weak as
if she had lain in bed an invalid for weeks. She pulled the fine gold-and-ivory silk scarf from
Temaile’s belt to wipe her mouth as the woman helped her turn toward the bedchamber door. Weak,
and her back turned.
Liandrin struck as hard as she ever had, with everything she had puzzled out of what the woman
had done to her.
Even as she did, saidar seemed to fill Moghedien like a flood. Liandrin’s probe died as the
Source was shielded from her. Flows of Air picked her up and slammed her against the paneled wall
hard enough to make her teeth rattle. Spread-eagled, helpless, she hung there.
Chesmal and Temaile exchanged confused glances, as if they did not understand what had
occurred. They continued to support Moghedien as she came to stand in front of Liandrin, still calmly
wiping her mouth on Temaile’s scarf. Moghedien channeled, and the blood on her shift turned black
and flaked away, falling to the carpet.
“Y-you do not understand, Great M-mistress,” Liandrin said frantically. “I only wished to help
you to have the good sleep.” For once in her life, slipping back into the accents of a commoner did
not concern her in the least. “I only—” She cut off with a strangled gagging as a flow of Air seized
her tongue, stretching it out between her teeth. Her brown eyes bulged. A hair more pressure, and . . .
“Shall I pull it out?” Moghedien studied her face, but spoke as if to herself. “I think not. A pity
for you that the al’Meara woman makes me think like Semirhage. Otherwise, I might only kill you.”
Suddenly she was tying off the shield, the knot growing ever more intricate, until Liandrin lost the
twists and turns completely. And still it went on. “There,” Moghedien said finally in tones of
satisfaction. “You will search a very long time to find anyone who can unravel that. But you will have
no opportunity to search.”
Liandrin searched Chesmal’s face, and Temaile’s, for some sign of sympathy, pity, anything.
Chesmal’s eyes were cold and stern; Temaile’s shone, and she touched her lips with the tip of her
tongue and smiled. Not a friendly smile.
“You thought you had learned something of compulsion,” Moghedien went on. “I will teach you
a bit more.” For an instant Liandrin shivered, Moghedien’s eyes filling her vision as the woman’s
voice filled her ears, her entire head. “Live.” The instant passed, and sweat beaded on Liandrin’s
face as the Chosen smiled at her. “Compulsion has many limits, but a command to do what someone
wants to do in their inmost depths will hold for a lifetime. You will live, however much you think you
want to take your life. And you will think of it. You will lie weeping many nights, wishing for it.”
The flow holding Liandrin’s tongue vanished, and she barely paused to swallow. “Please, Great
Mistress, I swear I did not mean—” Her head rang and silvery black spots danced before her eyes
from Moghedien’s slap.

“There are . . . attractions . . . to doing a thing physically,” the woman breathed. “Do you wish to
beg more?”
“Please, Great Mistress—” The second slap sent her hair flying.
“More?”
“Please—” A third nearly unhinged her jaw. Her cheek burned.
“If you cannot be more inventive than that, I will not listen. You will listen instead. I think what I
have planned for you would delight Semirhage herself.” Moghedien’s smile was almost as dark as
Temaile’s. “You will live, not stilled, but knowing that you could channel again, if only you found
someone to untie your shield. Yet that is only the beginning. Evon will be glad of a new scullery girl,
and I am sure the Arene woman will want to have long talks with you about her husband. Why, they
will enjoy your company so much that I doubt you will see the outside of this house during the years
to come. Long years in which to wish that you had served me faithfully.”
Liandrin shook her head, mouthing “no” and “please”; she was crying too hard to force the
words out.
Turning her head to Temaile, Moghedien said, “Prepare her for them. And tell them they are not
to kill or maim her. I want her always to believe she might escape. Even futile hope will keep her
alive to suffer.” She turned away on Chesmal’s arm, and the flows holding Liandrin to the wall
vanished.
Her legs gave way like straw, crumpling her to the carpet. Only the shield remained; she
hammered at it futilely as she crawled after Moghedien, trying to catch the hem of her shift, sobbing
brokenly. “Please, Great Mistress.”
“They are with a menagerie,” Moghedien told Chesmal. “All of your searching, and I had to find
them myself. A menagerie should not be too difficult to locate.”
“I will serve faithfully,” Liandrin wept. Fear turned her limbs to water; she could not crawl fast
enough to catch up. They did not even look back at her, scrabbling across the carpet after them. “Bind
me, Great Mistress. Anything. I will be the faithful dog!”
“There are many menageries traveling north,” Chesmal said, eagerness to negate her failure
filling her voice. “To Ghealdan, Great Mistress.”
“Then I must to Ghealdan,” Moghedien said. “You will procure fast horses and follow—” The
bedchamber door closed on her words.
“I will be the faithful dog,” Liandrin sobbed in a heap on the carpet. Lifting her head, she
blinked tears away to see Temaile watching her, rubbing her arms and smiling. “We could
overwhelm her, Temaile. We three together could—”
“We three?” Temaile laughed. “You could not overwhelm fat Evon.” Her eyes narrowed as she
studied the shield fastened to Liandrin. “You might as well be stilled.”
“Listen. Please.” Liandrin swallowed hard, trying to clear her voice, but it was still thick, if
burning with urgency, when she went on at frantic speed. “We have spoken of the dissension that must
rule among the Chosen. If Moghedien hides herself so, she must hide from the other Chosen. If we
take her and give her to them, think of the places we could have. We could be exalted above kings and
queens. We could be Chosen ourselves!”
For a moment—one blessed, wonderful moment—the child-faced woman hesitated. Then she
shook her head. “You have never known how high to lift your eyes. ‘Who reaches for the sun will be
burned.’ No, I think that I will not be burned for reaching too high. I think that I will do as I am told,
and soften you for Evon.” Suddenly she smiled, showing teeth that made her even more vulpine.
“How surprised he will be when you crawl to kiss his feet.”

Liandrin started screaming before Temaile even began.

Ripped Away

Yawning, Elayne watched Nynaeve from her bed, her head propped up on one elbow and
black hair spilling down her arm. It was really quite ridiculous, this insistence that whoever did not
go to Tel’aran’rhiod remain awake. She did not know how long an interval Nynaeve had experienced
in the World of Dreams, but Elayne had been lying here for a good two hours, with no book to read,
no needlework to do, nothing at all to occupy her except staring at the other woman stretched out on
her own narrow bed. Studying the a’dam was no good; she thought she had wrung everything out of it
that she could. She had even tried a slight touch of Healing on the sleeping woman, perhaps all the
Healing she knew. Nynaeve would never have consented to it awake—she did not think much of
Elayne’s abilities in that direction—or maybe she would have, in this case—but her black eye was
gone. In truth, that was the most complicated Healing Elayne had ever done, and it really had
exhausted her skill. Nothing to do. If she had some silver, she might have tried making an a’dam;
silver was not the only metal, but she would have to melt coins to get enough. The other woman
would be less pleased at that than at finding a second a’dam. If Nynaeve had been willing to tell
Thom and Juilin about this, at least she could have invited Thom in for conversation.
They really did have the most delightful talks. Like a father passing on his knowledge to his
daughter. She had never realized that the Game of Houses was so deeply embedded in Andor, if
thankfully not so deeply as it was in some other lands. Only the Borderlands escaped it entirely,
according to Thom. With the Blight right to the north, and Trolloc raids a daily fact, they had no time
for maneuvering and scheming. She and Thom had wonderful talks, now that he was sure she was not
going to try snuggling into his lap. Her face burned at the memory; she had actually thought of that
once or twice, and mercifully had not quite brought herself to it.
“ ‘Even a queen stubs her toe, but a wise woman watches the path,’ ” she quoted softly. Lini was
a wise woman. Elayne did not think she would make that particular mistake again. She knew she
made many, but seldom the same twice. One day, perhaps, she would make few enough to be worthy
to follow her mother on the throne.
Suddenly she sat up. Tears were leaking from Nynaeve’s closed eyes, trickling down the sides
of her face; what Elayne had taken for a faint snore—Nynaeve did snore, whatever she said—was a
tiny, whimpering sob deep in her throat. That should not be. If she had been injured, the hurt would
have appeared, although she would not feel it here until she woke.
Perhaps I should wake her. But she hesitated, even as her hand stretched toward the other
woman. Waking someone out of Tel’aran’rhiod was far from easy—shaking, even icy water in the
face would not always do—and Nynaeve would not appreciate being pummeled awake after the

bruising Cerandin had given her. I wonder what really happened. I will have to ask Cerandin.
Whatever was going on, Nynaeve should be able to step out of the dream whenever she wished.
Unless . . . Egwene said that the Wise Ones could hold someone in Tel’aran’rhiod against their will,
though if they had taught her the trick, she had not passed it on to Elayne or Nynaeve. If someone was
holding Nynaeve now, hurting her, it could not be Birgitte, or the Wise Ones. Well, the Wise Ones
might, if they caught her wandering where they thought she should not. But if not them, that left only
...
She took hold of Nynaeve’s shoulders to shake her—if that did not work, she would freeze the
pitcher of water on the table, or slap her face silly—and Nynaeve’s eyes popped open.
Immediately Nynaeve began to weep aloud, the most despairing sound Elayne had ever heard. “I
killed her. Oh, Elayne, I killed her with my foolish pride, thinking I could . . .” The words trailed off
in openmouthed sobs.
“You killed who?” It could not be Moghedien; that woman’s death would surely not bring this
grief. She was about to take Nynaeve in her arms to comfort her, when a pounding came at the door.
“Send them away,” Nynaeve mumbled, curling herself into a trembling ball in the middle of the
bed.
Sighing, Elayne made her way to the door and pulled it open, but before she could say a word,
Thom pushed past her out of the night, rumpled shirt bagging out of his breeches, carrying someone
shrouded in his cloak in his arms. Only a woman’s bare feet showed.
“She was just there,” Juilin said behind him, as if he did not believe the words coming out of his
own mouth. Both men were barefoot, and Juilin was stripped to the waist, lean and hairless-chested.
“I woke for a moment, and suddenly she was standing there, naked as the day she was born,
collapsing like a cut net.”
“She’s alive,” Thom said, laying the cloak-wrapped figure on Elayne’s bed, “but only barely. I
could hardly hear her heart.”
Frowning, Elayne pulled aside the cloak’s hood—and found herself staring at Birgitte’s face,
pale and wan.
Nynaeve scrambled stiffly from the other bed to kneel beside the unconscious woman. Her face
glistened with tears, but her weeping had stopped. “She is alive,” she breathed. “She is alive.”
Abruptly she seemed to realize that she was in her shift in front of the men, but she barely spared them
a glance, and all she said was “Get them out of here, Elayne. I can do nothing with them gawking like
sheep.”
Thom and Juilin rolled their eyes toward each other when Elayne made a herding motion at
them, and shook their heads slightly, but they backed toward the door without complaint. “She is . . . a
friend,” Elayne told them. She felt as if she were moving in a dream, floating, without feeling. How
could this be? “We will take care of her.” How could it possibly have happened? “Now, don’t say a
word to anyone.” The looks they gave her as she closed the door nearly made her blush. Of course
they knew better than to talk. But men did have to be reminded of the simplest things sometimes, even
Thom. “Nynaeve, how under the Light,” she began, turning, and cut off as the glow of saidar
surrounded the kneeling woman.
“Burn her!” Nynaeve growled, channeling fiercely. “Burn her forever for doing this!” Elayne
recognized the flows being woven for Healing, but recognition was as far as she could go. “I will
find her, Birgitte,” Nynaeve muttered. Strands of Spirit predominated, but Water and Air were in
there, and even Earth and Fire. It looked as complicated as embroidering one dress with either hand,
and two more with your feet. Blindfolded. “I will make her pay.” The glow shining about Nynaeve

grew and grew, until it overwhelmed the lamps, until it hurt to look at her except through slitted eyes.
“I swear it! By the Light and my hope of salvation and rebirth, I will!” The anger in her voice
changed, becoming deeper if anything. “It isn’t working. There is nothing wrong with her to Heal. She
is as perfect as anyone can be. But she is dying. Oh, Light, I can feel her slipping away. Burn
Moghedien! Burn her! And burn me along with her!” She was not giving up, though. The weaving
continued, complex flows weaving into Birgitte. And the woman lay there, golden braid flung over
the side of the bed, the rise and fall of her chest slowing.
“I can do something that might help,” Elayne said slowly. You were supposed to have
permission, but it had not always been so. Once it had been done almost as often without as with.
There was no reason it should not work on a woman. Except that she had never heard of it being done
to any but men.
“Linking?” Nynaeve did not look away from the woman on the bed, or stop her efforts with the
Power. “Yes. You will have to do it—I don’t know how—but let me guide. I do not know half what I
am doing right this minute, but I know that I can do it. You could not Heal a bruise.”
Elayne’s mouth tightened, but she let the remark lie. “Not linking.” The amount of saidar that
Nynaeve had drawn into herself was amazing. If she could not Heal Birgitte with that, what Elayne
could add would not make a difference. Together, they would be stronger than either apart, but not as
strong as if their two strengths were simply added. Besides, she was not certain that she could link.
She had only been linked once, and an Aes Sedai had done it, to show her what it was like more than
how. “Stop, Nynaeve. You said yourself it is not working. Stop and let me try. If it doesn’t work, you
can . . .” She could what? If Healing worked, it worked; if it did not . . . There was no point in trying
again if it failed.
“Try what?” Nynaeve snapped, yet she moved away awkwardly, letting Elayne come close. The
weave of Healing faded, but not the shining nimbus.
Instead of answering, Elayne put one hand on Birgitte’s forehead. Physical contact was as
necessary for this as for Healing, and the two times she had watched it done in the Tower, the Aes
Sedai had touched the man’s forehead. The flows of Spirit she wove were complex, if not so intricate
as Nynaeve’s of a moment before. She barely understood some of what she was doing, and none at all
of other parts, yet she had paid close attention, from her hiding place, to how the weave was shaped.
Watched closely because she had built up a stock of stories in her head, made silly romances where
there so seldom were any. After a moment, she sat down on the other bed and let saidar go.
Nynaeve frowned at her, then bent to examine Birgitte. The unconscious woman’s color was
perhaps a little better, her breathing a little stronger. “What did you do, Elayne?” Nynaeve did not
take her eyes from Birgitte, but the glow around her faded away slowly. “It wasn’t Healing. I think I
could do it myself, now, but it was not Healing.”
“Will she live?” Elayne asked faintly. There was no visible link between her and Birgitte, no
flows, but she could sense the woman’s weakness. A terrible weakness. She would know the moment
Birgitte died, even if she was sleeping, or hundreds of miles away.
“I do not know. She isn’t fading anymore, but I do not know.” Weariness made Nynaeve’s voice
soft, and pain touched it strongly, as if she shared Birgitte’s injury. Wincing, she rose and unfolded a
red-striped blanket to spread over the woman lying there. “What did you do?”
Silence held Elayne long enough for Nynaeve to join her, lowering herself awkwardly onto the
bed. “Bonding,” Elayne said finally. “I . . . bonded her. As a Warder.” The incredulous stare on the
other woman’s face made her rush on. “Healing was doing no good. I had to do something. You know
the gifts a Warder gets from being bonded. One is strength, energy. He can keep going when other men

would collapse and die, survive wounds that would kill anyone else. It was the only thing I could
think of.”
Nynaeve drew a deep breath. “Well, it is working better than what I did, at least. A woman
Warder. I wonder what Lan will think of that? No reason why she shouldn’t be. If any woman can, it
would be her.” Wincing, she curled her legs up beneath her; her gaze kept returning to Birgitte. “You
will have to keep this secret. If anyone learns that an Accepted has bonded a Warder, whatever the
circumstances . . .”
Elayne shivered. “I know,” she said simply, and quite fervently. It was not quite a stilling
offense, but any Aes Sedai would very likely make her wish she had been stilled. “Nynaeve, what
happened?”
For a long moment she thought the other woman was going to start crying again as her chin
quivered and her lips worked. When she began speaking, her voice was iron, her face a blend of fury
and too many tears ever to be shed. She told the tale starkly, almost sketchily, until she came to
Moghedien’s appearance among the wagons. That she rendered in painful detail.
“I should be welted from the neck down,” she said bitterly at last, touching a smooth, unmarked
arm. Unmarked or not, she flinched. “I don’t understand why I am not. I feel it, but I deserve the welts,
for stupid, foolish pride. For being too afraid to do what I should. I deserved being hung up like a
ham in a smokehouse. If there was any justice, I would still be dangling there, and Birgitte would not
be lying on that bed, with us wondering whether she’ll live or not. If only I knew more. If only I could
have Moghedien’s knowledge for five minutes, I could Heal her. I am sure of it.”
“If you were still hanging,” Elayne said practically, “in a very short while you would be waking
up and shielding me. I don’t doubt Moghedien would have seen to it that you were angry enough to
channel—she knows us all too well, remember—and I do doubt very much that I would have
suspected anything until you had done it. I do not fancy being carted off to Moghedien, and I cannot
believe you do either.” The other woman did not look at her. “It must have been a link, Nynaeve, like
a n a’dam. That is how she made you feel pain without marking you.” Nynaeve still sat there in a
glowering sulk. “Nynaeve, Birgitte is alive. You did everything you could for her, and the Light
willing, she will live. It was Moghedien who did this to her, not you. A soldier who takes blame for
comrades who fall in battle is a fool. You and I are soldiers in a battle, but you are not a fool, so stop
behaving like one.”
Nynaeve did look at her then, a scowl that lasted only a moment before she turned her face
completely away. “You don’t understand.” Her voice sank almost to a whisper. “She . . . was . . . one
of the heroes bound to the Wheel of Time, destined to be born again and again to make legends. She
wasn’t born this time, Elayne. She was ripped out of Tel’aran’rhiod as she stood. Is she still bound
to the Wheel? Or has she been ripped away from that, too? Ripped away from what her own courage
earned her, because I was so proud, so man-stubborn stupid, that I made her hunt for Moghedien?”
Elayne had hoped that those questions had not occurred to Nynaeve yet, would not until she had
had a little time to recover first. “Do you know how badly Moghedien was hurt? Maybe she is dead.”
“I hope not,” the other woman almost snarled. “I want to make her pay. . . .” She took a deep
breath, but instead of invigorating her, it seemed to make her sag. “I would not count on her dying.
Birgitte’s shot missed her heart. A wonder she managed to hit the woman at all, staggering as she
was. I could not have stood up if I were thrown that far, hard enough to bounce like that. I couldn’t
even stand up after what Moghedien did to me. No, she is alive, and we had best believe that she can
have her wound Healed and be after us by morning.”
“She would still need time to rest, Nynaeve. You know that. Can she even know where we are?

From what you said, she had no time to do more than see that this is a menagerie.”
“What if she did see more?” Nynaeve rubbed her temples as if it were difficult to think. “What if
she knows exactly where we are? She could send Darkfriends after us. Or send word to Darkfriends
in Samara.”
“Luca is livid because eleven menageries are already around the city, and three more are
waiting to cross the bridge. Nynaeve, it will take her days to regain strength after a wound like that,
even if she does find some Black sister to Heal her, or one of the other Forsaken. And more days to
search through fifteen menageries. That is if there are not more on the road behind us, or coming from
Altara. If she does come after us or send Darkfriends, either one, we are forewarned, and we have
days to find a boat that can carry us downriver.” She paused a moment, thinking. “Do you have
anything to dye your hair in that bag of herbs? I’ll wager anything that you had your hair braided in
Tel’aran’rhiod. Mine is always its real color, there. If yours is loose, as it is now, and another color,
it will make us that much harder to find.”
“Whitecloaks everywhere,” Nynaeve sighed. “Galad. The Prophet. No boats. It is as if
everything is conspiring to hold us here for Moghedien. I am so tired, Elayne. Tired of being afraid of
who might be around the next corner. Tired of being afraid of Moghedien. I cannot seem to think of
what to do next. My hair? Nothing that would make it any color I’d have.”
“You need to sleep,” Elayne said firmly. “Without the ring. Give it to me.” The other woman
hesitated, but Elayne merely waited with her hand outstretched until Nynaeve fished the flecked stone
ring from the cord around her neck. Stuffing it into her pouch, Elayne went on. “Now you lie down
here, and I will watch Birgitte.”
Nynaeve stared at the woman stretched out on the other bed for a moment, then shook her head.
“I can’t sleep. I . . . need to be alone. To walk.” Getting to her feet as stiffly as if she really had been
beaten, she took her dark cloak from its peg and swung it over her shift. At the door she paused. “If
she wants to kill me,” she said bleakly, “I do not know that I could make myself stop her.” She went
into the night barefoot and sad-faced.
Elayne hesitated, unsure which woman needed her more, before settling back where she sat.
Nothing she said could make things better for Nynaeve, but she had faith in the woman’s resilience.
Time alone to work it all over in her mind, and she would see that blame lay at Moghedien’s door,
not hers. She had to.

CHAPTER
36

A New Name

For a long time Elayne sat there, watching Birgitte sleep. It did seem to be sleep. Once she
stirred, muttering in a desperate voice, “Wait for me, Gaidal. Wait. I’m coming, Gaidal. Wait for . . .”
Words trailed off into slow breath again. Was it stronger? The woman still looked deathly ill. Better
than she had, but pale and drawn.
After perhaps an hour, Nynaeve returned, her feet dirty. Fresh tears shone on her cheeks. “I
could not stay away,” she said, hanging her cloak back on its peg. “You sleep. I will watch her. I have
to watch her.”
Elayne rose slowly, smoothing her skirts. Perhaps watching over Birgitte for a time would help
Nynaeve work matters out. “I don’t feel like sleeping yet, either.” She was exhausted, but not sleepy
any longer. “I think I will stroll outside myself.” Nynaeve only nodded as she took Elayne’s place on
the bed, her dusty feet dangling over the side, her eyes fastened to Birgitte.
To Elayne’s surprise, Thom and Juilin were not asleep either. They had built a small fire beside
the wagon and sat on either side of it, cross-legged on the ground, smoking their long-stemmed pipes.
Thom had tucked his shirt in, and Juilin had donned his coat, though no shirt, and turned the cuffs
back. She took a look around before joining them. No one stirred in the camp, dark except for the light
of this one fire and the glow of the lamps from their wagon’s windows.
Neither man said anything while she settled her skirts; then Juilin looked at Thom, who nodded,
and the thief-catcher took something from the ground and held it out to her. “I found it where she was
lying,” the dark man said. “As if it had dropped from her hand.”
Elayne took the silver arrow slowly. Even the fletching feathers appeared to be silver.
“Distinctive,” Thom said conversationally around his pipe. “And added to the braid . . . Every
story mentions the braid for some reason. Though I’ve found some I think might be her under other
names, without it. And some under other names with.”
“I do not care about stories,” Juilin put in. He sounded no more agitated than Thom. But then, it
took a great deal to agitate either one of them. “Is it her? Bad enough if it isn’t, a woman appearing
naked out of nothing like that, but . . . What have you gotten us into, you and N . . . Nana?” He was
troubled; Juilin did not make mistakes, and his tongue never slipped. Thom merely bubbled at his
pipe, waiting.
Elayne turned the arrow in her hands, pretending to study it. “She is a friend,” she said finally.
Until—unless—Birgitte released her, her promise held. “She is not Aes Sedai, but she has been
helping us.” They looked at her, waiting for her to say more. “Why didn’t you give this to Nynaeve?”
One of those glances passed between them—men seemed to carry on entire conversations
through glances, around women at least—saying as clearly as spoken words what they thought of her

keeping secrets. Especially when they all but knew for certain already. But she had given her word.
“She seemed upset,” Juilin said, sucking at his pipe judiciously, and Thom took his from
between his teeth and blew out his white mustaches.
“Upset? The woman came out in her shift, looking lost, and when I asked if I could help her, she
didn’t snap my head off. She cried on my shoulder!” He plucked at his linen shirt, muttering something
about dampness. “Elayne, she apologized for every cross word she has ever said to me, which is
very nearly every other word out of her mouth. Said she ought to be switched, or maybe that she had
been; she was incoherent half the time. She said she was a coward, and a stubborn fool. I don’t know
what is the matter with her, but she isn’t herself by a mile.”
“I knew a woman who behaved like this, once,” Juilin said, peering into the fire. “She woke to
find a burglar in her bedchamber and stabbed the man through the heart. Only, when she lit a lamp, it
was her husband. His boat had come back to the docks early. She walked around like Nynaeve for
half a month.” His mouth tightened. “Then she hanged herself.”
“I hate to lay this burden on you, child,” Thom added gently, “but if she can be helped, you are
the only one of us who can do it. I know how to take a man out of his miseries. Give him a swift kick,
or else get him drunk and find him a pr—” He harrumphed loudly, trying to make it seem a cough, and
knuckled his mustaches. The one bad thing about him seeing her as a daughter was that now
sometimes he seemed to think she was perhaps twelve. “Anyway, the point is that I do not know how
to do this. And while Juilin might be willing to dandle her on his knee, I doubt she’d thank him for it.”
“I would sooner dandle a fangfish,” the thief-catcher muttered, but not as roughly as he would
have yesterday. He was as concerned as Thom, though less willing to admit it.
“I will do what I can,” she assured them, turning the arrow again. They were good men, and she
did not like lying to them, or hiding things from them. Not unless it was absolutely necessary, anyway.
Nynaeve claimed that you had to manage men for their own good, but there was such a thing as taking
it too far. It was not right to lead a man into dangers he knew nothing of.
So she told them. About Tel’aran’rhiod and the Forsaken being loose, about Moghedien. Not
quite everything, of course. Some events in Tanchico had been too shaming for her to want to think of
them. Her promise held her concerning Birgitte’s identity, and there was certainly no need to go into
detail about what Moghedien had done to Nynaeve. It made explaining this night’s happenings a little
difficult, yet she managed. She did tell them everything she thought they should know, enough to make
them aware for the first time what they were really up against. Not just the Black Ajah—that had
certainly made them stare cross-eyed when they learned it—but the Forsaken, and one of them very
likely hunting her and Nynaeve. And she made it quite plain that they two would be hunting
Moghedien as well, and that anyone close to them was in danger of being caught between hunter and
prey either way.
“Now that you know,” she finished, “the choice to stay or go is yours.” She left it at that, and
was careful not to look at Thom. She hoped almost desperately that he would stay, but she would not
let him think that she was asking, not by so much as a glance.
“I haven’t taught you half what you need to know if you’re to be as good a queen as your
mother,” he said, trying to sound gruff and spoiling it by brushing a strand of black-dyed hair from her
cheek with a gnarled finger. “You’ll not rid yourself of me this easily, child. I mean to see you
mistress of Daes Dae’mar if I must drone in your ear until you go deaf. I haven’t even taught you to
handle a knife. I tried to teach your mother, but she always said she could tell a man to use a knife if
one needed using. Fool way to look at it.”
She leaned forward and kissed his leathery cheek, and he blinked, bushy eyebrows shooting up,

then smiled and stuck his pipe back into his mouth.
“You can kiss me, too,” Juilin said dryly. “Rand al’Thor will have my guts for fish bait if I don’t
hand you back to him in the same health he last saw you.”
Elayne lifted her chin. “I will not have you stay for Rand al’Thor, Juilin.” Hand her back?
Indeed! “You will stay only if you want to. And I do not release you—or you, Thom!”—he had
grinned at the thief-catcher’s comment—“from your promise to do as you are told.” Thom’s startled
look was quite satisfying. She turned back to Juilin. “You will follow me, and Nynaeve of course,
knowing full well the enemies we face, or you may pack your belongings and ride Skulker where you
wish. I will give him to you.”
Juilin sat up straight as a post, his dark face going darker. “I have never abandoned a woman in
danger in my life.” He pointed his pipestem at her like a weapon. “You send me away, and I will be
on your heels like a soarer on a stern-chase.”
Not exactly what she wanted, but it would do. “Very well, then.” Rising, she held herself erect,
the silver arrow at her side, and kept her slightly frosty manner. She thought they had finally realized
who was in charge. “Morning is not far off.” Had Rand actually had the nerve to tell Juilin to “hand
her back”? Thom would just have to suffer along with the other man for a time, and it served him right
for that grin. “You will put out this fire and go to sleep. Now. No excuses, Thom. You’ll be no good
at all tomorrow without sleep.”
Obediently they began scuffing dirt over the flames with their boots, but when she reached the
plain wooden steps of the wagon, she heard Thom say, “Sounds like her mother sometimes.”
“Then I am glad I have never met the woman,” Juilin grumbled in reply. “Flip for first guard?”
Thom murmured an assent.
She almost went back, but found herself smiling instead. Men! It was a fond thought. Her good
mood lasted until she was inside.
Nynaeve sat on the very edge of the bed, holding herself up with both hands, eyes trying to drift
shut as she watched Birgitte. Her feet were still dirty.
Elayne put Birgitte’s arrow into one of the cupboards behind some rough sacks of dried peas.
Luckily, the other woman never so much as glanced at her. She did not think the sight of the silver
arrow was what Nynaeve needed right at that moment. But what was?
“Nynaeve, it is past time for you to wash your feet and go to sleep.”
Nynaeve swayed in her direction, blinking sleepily. “Feet? What? I must watch her.”
It would have to be one step at a time. “Your feet, Nynaeve. They are dirty. Wash them.”
Frowning, Nynaeve peered down at her dusty feet, then nodded. She spilled water tipping the
big white pitcher over the washbasin, and sloshed more out before she was washed and ready to
towel dry, but even then she resumed her seat. “I must watch. In case . . . In case . . . She cried out
once. For Gaidal.”
Elayne pressed her back on the mattress. “You need sleep, Nynaeve. You can’t keep your eyes
open.”
“I can,” Nynaeve muttered sullenly, trying to sit up against Elayne’s pressure on her shoulders.
“I must watch her, Elayne. I must.”
Nynaeve made the two men outside look sensible and biddable. Even if Elayne had had a mind
to, there was no way to get her drunk and find her a—a pretty young man, she supposed it would have
to be. That left a swift kick. Sympathy and common sense had surely made no impression. “I have had
enough of this sulking and self-pity, Nynaeve,” she said firmly. “You are going to sleep now, and in
the morning you are not going to say one word about what a miserable wretch you are. If you cannot

behave like the clearheaded woman you are, I will ask Cerandin to give you two black eyes for the
one I took away. You did not even thank me for that. Now go to sleep!”
Nynaeve’s eyes widened indignantly—at least she did not look on the point of tears—but Elayne
slid them shut with her fingers. They closed easily, and despite softly murmured protests, the deep
slow breath of sleep followed quickly.
Elayne patted Nynaeve’s shoulder before straightening. She hoped it was a peaceful sleep, with
dreams of Lan, but any sort of sleep was better for her now than none. Fighting a yawn, she bent to
check Birgitte. She could not tell whether the woman’s color or breathing was any better. There was
nothing to do but wait and hope.
The lamps did not seem to be bothering either of the women, so she left them alight and sat on
the floor between the beds. They should help keep her awake. Not that she knew why she should
remain awake, really. She had done what she could as much as Nynaeve had. Unthinkingly she leaned
back against the front wall, and her chin sank slowly to her chest.
The dream was a pleasant one, if odd. Rand knelt before her, and she put a hand on his head and
bonded him as her Warder. One of her Warders; she would have to choose Green now, with Birgitte.
There were other women there, faces changing between one glance and the next. Nynaeve, Min,
Moiraine, Aviendha, Berelain, Amathera, Liandrin, others she did not know. Whoever they were, she
knew that she had to share him with them, because in the dream she was certain that that was what
Min had viewed. She was not sure how she felt about that—some of those faces she wanted to claw
to shreds—but if it was fated by the Pattern, it would have to be. Yet she would have one thing of him
the others could never have, the bond between Warder and Aes Sedai.
“Where is this place?” Berelain said, raven-haired and so beautiful that Elayne wanted to bare
her teeth. The woman wore the low-cut red dress that Luca wanted Nynaeve to wear; she always
dressed revealingly. “Wake up. This is not Tel’aran’rhiod.”
Elayne started awake to find Birgitte leaning over the side of the bed, gripping her arm weakly.
Her face was too pale, and damp with sweat as if a fever had broken, but her blue eyes were sharp
and intent on Elayne’s face.
“This is not Tel’aran’rhiod.” It was not a question, but Elayne nodded, and Birgitte sank back
with a long sigh. “I remember everything,” she whispered. “I am here as I am, and I remember. All is
changed. Gaidal is out there, somewhere, an infant, or even a young boy. But even if I find him, what
will he think of a woman more than old enough to be his mother?” She scrubbed angrily at her eyes,
muttering, “I do not cry. I never cry. I remember that, the Light help me. I never cry.”
Elayne got up on her knees beside the woman’s bed. “You will find him, Birgitte.” She kept her
voice low. Nynaeve still seemed sound asleep—a small, rasping snore rose from her regularly—but
she needed rest, not to confront this all over again now. “Somehow you will. And he will love you. I
know he will.”
“Do you think that is what matters? I could stand him not loving me.” Her glistening eyes gave
her the lie. “He will need me, Elayne, and I will not be there. He always has more courage than is
good for him; I always must supply him with caution. Worse, he will wander, searching for me, not
knowing what he is looking for, not knowing why he feels incomplete. We are always together,
Elayne. Two halves of a whole.” The tears welled up, flowing across her face. “Moghedien said she
would make me cry forever, and she . . .” Suddenly her features contorted; low ragged sobs came as
if ripped from her throat.
Elayne gathered the taller woman into her arms, murmuring words of comfort she knew were
useless. How would she feel if Rand were taken away from her? The thought was nearly enough to

make her put her head down atop Birgitte’s and join her weeping.
She was not sure how long it took Birgitte to cry herself out, but eventually she pushed Elayne
away and settled back, wiping her cheeks with her fingers. “I have never done that except as a small
child. Never.” Twisting her neck, she frowned at Nynaeve, still asleep on the other bed. “Did
Moghedien hurt her badly? I have not seen anyone trussed like that since the Tourag took Mareesh.”
Elayne must have looked confused, because she added, “In another Age. Is she hurt?”
“Not badly. Her spirit, mainly. What you did allowed her to escape, but only after . . .” Elayne
could not make herself say it. Too many wounds were too fresh. “She blames herself. She thinks that
. . . everything . . . is her fault, for asking you to help.”
“If she had not asked me, Moghedien would be teaching her to beg right now. She has as little
caution as Gaidal.” Birgitte’s dry tone sounded odd with her wet cheeks. “She did not drag me into
this by my hair. If she claims responsibility for the consequences, then she claims responsibility for
my actions.” If anything, she sounded angry. “I am a free woman, and I made my own choices. She did
not decide for me.”
“I must say you are taking this better than . . . I would.” She could not say “better than Nynaeve.”
That was true, but the other was as well.
“I always say, if you must mount the gallows, give a jest to the crowd, a coin to the hangman, and
make the drop with a smile on your lips.” Birgitte’s smile was grim. “Moghedien sprang the trap, but
my neck is not yet snapped. Perhaps I will surprise her before it is done.” The smile faded into a
frown as she studied Elayne. “I can . . . feel you. I think I could close my eyes and point to you a mile
away.”
Elayne took a very deep breath. “I bonded you as a Warder,” she said in a rush. “You were
dying, and Healing did no good, and . . .” The woman was looking at her. Not frowning anymore, but
her eyes were disconcertingly sharp. “There was no other choice, Birgitte. You would have died,
else.”
“A Warder,” Birgitte said slowly. “I think I remember hearing a tale of a female Warder, but it
was in a life so long ago that I cannot remember more than that.”
It was time for another deep breath, and this time she had to force the words. “There is
something you should know. You will discover it sooner or later, and I’ve decided not to keep things
from people who have a right to know, not unless I absolutely must.” A third breath. “I am not Aes
Sedai. I am only Accepted.”
For a long moment, the golden-braided woman stared up at her, then slowly shook her head. “An
Accepted. In the Trolloc Wars, I knew an Accepted who bonded a fellow. Barashelle was due to be
tested the next day for raising to full Aes Sedai, and certain to be given the shawl, but she was afraid
that a woman testing that same day would take him. In the Trolloc Wars, the Tower tried to raise
women as quickly as possible, from necessity.”
“What happened?” Elayne could not stop herself from asking. Barashelle? That name sounded
familiar.
Lacing her fingers over the blanket atop her bosom, Birgitte shifted her head on the pillow and
put on a look of mock sympathy. “Needless to say, she was not allowed to take the tests once it was
discovered. Necessity did not outweigh such an offense. They made her pass the poor fellow’s bond
to another, and to teach her patience, put her into the kitchens among the scullions and spit-girls. I
heard that she stayed there three years, and when she did receive her shawl, the Amyrlin Seat herself
chose her Warder, a leather-faced, stone-stubborn man named Anselan. I saw them a few years after,
and I could not tell which of them gave the commands. I do not think Barashelle was certain either.”

“Not pleasant,” Elayne muttered. Three years in the . . . Wait. Barashelle and Anselan? It could
not be the same pair; that story said nothing about Barashelle being Aes Sedai. But she had read two
versions and heard Thom tell another, and all had Barashelle doing some long, arduous service to
earn Anselan’s love. Two thousand years could change a great deal in a story.
“Not pleasant,” Birgitte agreed, and suddenly her eyes were much too large and innocent in her
pale face. “I suppose, since you wish me to keep your dreadful secret, you will not ride me as hard as
some Aes Sedai ride their Warders. It would not do to push me to tell just to escape you.”
Elayne’s chin came up instinctively. “That sounds very like a threat. I do not take well to threats,
from you or anyone else. If you think—”
The reclining woman caught her arm and cut her off apologetically; her grip was noticeably
stronger. “Please. I did not intend it that way. Gaidal claims I have a sense of humor like a rock
tossed into a shoja-circle.” A cloud swept across her face at Gaidal’s name, and was gone. “You
saved my life, Elayne. I will keep your secret and serve you as Warder. And be your friend, if you
will have me.”
“I will be proud to have you for friend.” Shoja-circle? She would ask another time. Birgitte
might be stronger, but she needed rest, not questions. “And for Warder.” It seemed that she really was
going to choose the Green Ajah; aside from everything else, that was the only way she could bond
Rand. The dream was still clear in her mind, and she intended to convince him to accept it one way or
another. “Perhaps you could try to . . . moderate . . . your sense of humor?”
“I will try.” Birgitte sounded as if she were saying she would try to pick up a mountain. “But if I
am to be your Warder, even in secret, then I will be Warder to you. You can barely hold your eyes
open. It is time for you to sleep.” Elayne’s eyebrows and chin shot up together, but the woman gave
her no opportunity to speak. “Among many other things, it is a Warder’s place to tell his—her—Aes
Sedai when she pushes herself too hard. Also to provide a dose of caution when she thinks she can
walk into the Pit of Doom. And to keep her alive so she can do what she must. I will do these things
for you. Never fear for your back when I am near, Elayne.”
She did need sleep, she supposed, but Birgitte needed it more. Elayne dimmed the lamps and got
the woman settled and asleep, though not until Birgitte had seen her put a pillow and blankets on the
floor between the beds for herself. There was some slight argument over who would sleep on the
floor, but Birgitte was still weak enough that Elayne had no trouble making her stay in the bed. Well,
not very much anyway. At least Nynaeve’s soft snore never broke.
She herself did not go to sleep immediately, whatever she had told Birgitte. The woman could
not put her nose outside the wagon until she had something to wear, and she was taller than Elayne or
Nynaeve. Sitting down between the beds, Elayne began letting out the hem on her dark gray silk riding
dress. There would hardly be time in the morning for more than a quick fitting and stitching the new
hem. Sleep overtook her with her ripping no more than half done.
She had the dream of bonding Rand again, more than once. Sometimes he knelt voluntarily, and
sometimes she had to do what she had done with Birgitte, even sneaking into his bedchamber while
he slept. Birgitte was one of the other women now. Elayne did not mind that too much. Not her, or
Min, or Egwene, or Aviendha, or Nynaeve, though she could not imagine what Lan would say to that
last. Others, though . . . She had just ordered Birgitte, in a Warder’s color-shifting cloak, to drag
Berelain and Elaida to the kitchens for three years, when suddenly the two women began pummeling
her. She awakened to find Nynaeve trampling her to reach Birgitte and check on the woman. The gray
light just before dawn showed in the small windows.
Birgitte woke claiming she was as strong as ever, and ravenous besides. Elayne was not certain

whether Nynaeve had finished her bout of self-blame. She did not wring her hands or speak of it, but
while Elayne washed her face and hands, and explained about the menagerie and why they had to
remain with it a while longer, Nynaeve hastily peeled and cored red pears and yellow apples, sliced
cheese, and handed it all to Birgitte on a plate with a cup of watered wine with honey and spices. She
would have fed the woman had Birgitte let her. Nynaeve washed Birgitte’s hair in white henpepper
herself, until it was as black as Elayne’s—Elayne did her own, of course—donated her best stockings
and shift, and looked disappointed when a pair of Elayne’s slippers fit better. She insisted on helping
Birgitte into the gray silk as soon as her hair had been toweled dry and braided again—the hips and
bosom needed letting out, too, but that would have to wait—and even wanted to stitch the hem herself,
until Elayne’s incredulous stare made her retreat to her own ablutions, muttering as she scrubbed her
face that she could sew as well as anyone. When she wanted to.
When they went outside at last, the first sharp golden edge of the sun was peeking above the
trees to the east. For this little while, the day felt deceptively comfortable. There was not a cloud to
be seen in the sky, and by noon the air would be hot and gritty.
Thom and Juilin were hitching the team to the wagon, and the whole camp bustled in preparation
for moving. Skulker was already saddled, and Elayne made a note to herself to speak up about riding
today herself before one of the men took possession of the saddle. Even if Thom or Juilin got there
first, though, she would not be too disappointed. This very afternoon she would highwalk in front of
people for the first time. The costume Luca had shown her made her a little nervous, but at least she
was not moaning about it as Nynaeve did.
Luca himself came striding rapidly through the camp, red cloak fluttering behind, chivvying and
shouting unneeded instructions. “Latelle, wake those bloody bears! I want them on their feet, snarling,
when we drive through Samara. Clarine, you watch those dogs this time. If one of them goes chasing
after a cat again . . . Brugh, you and your brothers do your tumbling just ahead of my wagon, mind.
Just ahead. This is supposed to be a stately procession, not a race to see which of you can backflip
the fastest! Cerandin, keep those boar-horses in hand. I want people to gasp in amazement, not run in
terror!”
He stopped at their wagon, glowering at Nynaeve and herself equally with a bit left over for
Birgitte. “Kind of you to decide to come with the rest of us, Mistress Nana, my Lady Morelin. I
thought you meant to sleep until midday.” He nodded toward Birgitte. “Having a chat with someone
from across the river, are you? Well, we’ve no time for visitors. I mean to be set up and performing
by noon.”
Nynaeve looked taken aback by the onslaught, but by the end of his second sentence she was
meeting him glare for glare. Whatever her awkwardness toward Birgitte, it apparently did not hinder
her temper where others were concerned. “We will be ready as soon as anyone, and you know it,
Valan Luca. Besides, an hour or two will make no difference anyway. There are enough people
gathered on the other side of the river that if one in a hundred comes to your show it will be more than
you ever dreamed. If we decide to make a leisurely breakfast, you can just twiddle your thumbs and
wait. You’ll not get what you want if you leave us behind.”
That was her bluntest reminder yet of the promised hundred gold marks, but for once it did not
slow him. “Enough people? Enough people! People must be attracted, woman. Chin Akima has been
in place three days, and he has a fellow who juggles swords and axes. And nine acrobats. Nine! Some
woman I’ve never heard of has two women acrobats who do things on a hanging rope that would
make the Chavanas’ eyes pop. You would not believe the crowds. Sillia Cerano has men with their
faces painted like court fools, splashing each other with water and hitting each other over the head

with bladders, and people are paying an extra silver penny just to watch!” Suddenly his eyes
narrowed, focusing on Birgitte. “Would you be willing to paint your face? Sillia doesn’t have a
woman among her fools. Some of the horse handlers would be willing. It doesn’t hurt, getting hit with
an inflated bladder, and I will pay you. . . .” He trailed off, musing—he did not like parting with
money any more than Nynaeve did—and Birgitte spoke into his momentary silence.
“I am not a fool, and will not be a fool. I am an archer.”
“An archer,” he muttered, eyeing the intricate glossy black braid pulled over her left shoulder.
“And I suppose you call yourself Birgitte. What are you? One of those idiots hunting the Horn of
Valere? Even if the thing exists, what chance any one of you will find it more than another? I was in
Illian when the Hunters’ oaths were given, and there were thousands in the Great Square of Tammaz.
But for glory that you can attain, nothing can outshine the applause of—”
“I am an archer, pretty man,” Birgitte broke in firmly. “Fetch a bow, and I will outshoot you or
anyone you name, a hundred gold crowns to your one.” Elayne expected Nynaeve to yelp—it was they
who would have to cover the wager if Birgitte lost, and whatever she claimed, Elayne did not think
Birgitte could be fully recovered already—yet all Nynaeve did was close her eyes briefly and draw a
deep, long breath.
“Women!” Luca growled. Thom and Juilin did not have to look as if they agreed. “You are a fine
match for the Lady Morelin and Nana, or whatever their names are.” He swept his silk cloak in a
wide gesture at the surrounding hustle of men and horses. “It may have escaped your keen eye,
Birgitte, but I have a show to get under way, and my rivals are already draining Samara of coin like
the cutpurses they are.”
Birgitte smiled, a slight curving of her lips. “Are you afraid, pretty man? We can make your side
a silver penny.”
Elayne thought Luca might have apoplexy from the color that crept into his face. His neck
suddenly looked too big for his collar. “I will fetch my bow,” he almost hissed. “You can work off
the hundred marks with your face painted, or cleaning cages for all I care!”
“Are you sure that you are well enough?” Elayne asked Birgitte as he stalked off muttering to
himself. The only word she caught was a repeat of “Women!” Nynaeve was looking at the woman
with the braid as if she wanted the ground to open and swallow her; herself, not Birgitte. A number of
the horse handlers had gathered around Thom and Juilin for some reason.
“He has nice legs,” Birgitte said, “but I have never liked tall men. Add a pretty face, and they
are always insufferable.”
Petra had joined the group of men, twice as wide as any other. He said something, then shook
hands with Thom. The Chavanas were there as well. And Latelle, talking earnestly with Thom while
darting dark looks at Nynaeve and the two women with her. By the time Luca returned with an
unstrung bow and a quiver of arrows, no one was making preparations any longer. The wagons and
horses and cages—even the tethered boar-horses—stood abandoned, the people all clustered around
Thom and the thief-catcher. They followed as Luca led the way a short distance out of the camp.
“I am accounted a fair shot,” he said, carving a white cross chest-high to himself on the trunk of
a tall oak. He had some of his jauntiness back, and he swaggered as he strode off fifty paces. “I will
take the first shot, so you can see what you face.”
Birgitte plucked the bow from his hand and walked off another fifty as he stared after her. She
shook her head over the bow, but braced it on her slippered foot and strung it in one smooth motion
before Luca joined her and Elayne and Nynaeve. Birgitte pulled an arrow from the quiver he held,
examined it a moment, then tossed it aside like rubbish. Luca frowned and opened his mouth, but she

was already discarding a second shaft. The next three went to the leaf-covered ground as well before
she stuck one point-down in the soil beside her. Of twenty-one, she kept only four.
“She can do it,” Elayne whispered, trying to sound certain. Nynaeve nodded bleakly; if they had
to pay out a hundred gold crowns, they would soon be selling the jewelry Amathera had given them.
The letters-of-rights were all but useless, as she had explained to Nynaeve; their use would
eventually point a finger to where they had been been for Elaida, if not where they were. If I had just
spoken up in time, I could have stopped this. As my Warder, she has to do as I say. Doesn’t she?
From the evidence so far, obedience was no part of the bond. Had those Aes Sedai she had spied on
made the men give oaths as well? Now that she thought of it, she believed one of them had.
Birgitte nocked an arrow, raised the bow, and loosed seemingly without pausing to aim. Elayne
winced, but the steel point struck dead center in the middle of the carved white cross. Before it
stopped quivering, the second brushed in beside it. Birgitte did wait a moment then, but only for the
two arrows to still. A gasp rose from the onlookers as the third shaft split the first, but that was
nothing to the absolute silence as the last split the other just as neatly. Once could have been chance.
Twice . . .
Luca looked as if his eyes were coming out of his head. Mouth hanging open, he stared at the
tree, then at Birgitte, at the tree, then Birgitte. She proffered the bow, and he shook his head weakly.
Suddenly he flung the quiver away, spreading his arms wide with a glad cry. “Not knives!
Arrows! From a hundred paces!”
Nynaeve sagged against Elayne as the man explained what he wanted, but she made not one
sound of protest. Thom and Juilin were collecting money; most handed over coins with a sigh or a
laugh, but Juilin had to snag Latelle’s arm as she tried to slip away, and speak some angry words
before she dug coins from her pouch. So that was what they had been up to. She would have to speak
to them firmly. But later. “Nana, you don’t have to go through with this.” The woman only stared at
Birgitte, eyes haggard.
“Our wager?” Birgitte said when Luca ran out of wind. He grimaced, then fished slowly into his
pouch and tossed her a coin. Elayne caught the glint of gold in the sun as Birgitte examined it, then
tossed it right back. “The bet was a silver penny on your part.”
Luca’s eyes widened in startlement, but the next moment he was laughing and pressing the gold
crown into her hand. “You are worth every copper of it. What do you say? Why, the Queen of
Ghealdan herself might come to see a performance such as yours. Birgitte and her arrows. We will
paint them silver, and the bow!”
Desperately Elayne wanted Birgitte to look at her. They might as well put up a sign for
Moghedien as do what the man suggested.
But Birgitte only bounced the coin on her hand, grinning. “Paint will ruin an already shabby
bow,” she said finally. “And call me Maerion; I was called that, once.” Leaning on the bow, she let
her smile widen. “Can I have a red dress, too?”
Elayne heaved a sigh of fervent relief. Nynaeve looked as if she were going to sick up.

CHAPTER
37

Performances in Samara

For what seemed the hundredth time, Nynaeve held a lock of her hair up to look at it and
sighed. Thick murmurs of talk and laughter from hundreds if not thousands of throats, distant music
that was nearly drowned out, drifted in through the wagon walls. She had not minded spending the
parade through the streets of Samara in the wagon with Elayne—occasional peeks through the
windows had convinced her that she would just as soon not be out in those packed crowds, yelling
and barely making way for the wagons—but every time she looked at the brassy red of her hair, she
wished she had been doing somersaults with the Chavanas rather than dyeing it.
Carefully not looking at herself, she wrapped up completely in her plain dark gray shawl, turned,
and gave a start to find Birgitte standing in the doorway. The woman had ridden in Clarine and
Petra’s wagon during the parade, with Clarine altering a spare red dress she had been making for
Nynaeve at Luca’s direction; he had given Clarine her instructions before Nynaeve ever agreed.
Birgitte wore it now, her black-dyed braid pulled over her shoulder so it nestled between her breasts,
totally unconscious of the low square neck. Just looking at her made Nynaeve fold her shawl tighter;
Birgitte could not show a fingernail more of pale bosom and retain the slightest claim to decency. As
it was, such a claim would be feeble, really quite laughable. Looking at her made Nynaeve’s stomach
knot up, but not for reasons of clothes or skin.
“If you are going to wear the dress, why cover up?” Birgitte came inside and closed the door
behind her. “You are a woman. Why not be proud of it?”
“If you think I shouldn’t,” Nynaeve replied hesitantly, and slowly let the shawl slide down to her
elbows, revealing the twin of the other woman’s garment. She felt all but naked. “I only thought . . . I
thought . . .” Gripping her silk skirts hard to keep her hands at her sides, she held her gaze on the other
woman. Even knowing she wore exactly the same herself, it was easier that way.
Birgitte grimaced. “And if I wanted you to lower the neck another inch?”
Nynaeve opened her mouth, face going as scarlet as the gown, but for a moment nothing came
out. When it did, she sounded as if she were being strangled. “There isn’t an inch to lower it. Look at
your own. There isn’t a tenth!”
Three quick, frowning strides, and Birgitte bent slightly to put her face right in Nynaeve’s. “And
if I said I wanted you to rid yourself of that inch?” she snarled, showing teeth. “What if I wanted to
paint your face, so Luca could have his fool? What if I stripped you out of it altogether and painted
you from head to toe? A fine target you would make then. Every man inside fifty miles would come to
see.”
Nynaeve’s mouth worked, but this time no sound emerged at all. She wanted very much to close
her eyes; maybe when she opened them, none of this would be happening.

With a disgusted shake of her head, Birgitte took a seat on one of the beds, one elbow on her
knee and her blue eyes sharp. “This must stop. When I look at you, you flinch. You run about waiting
on me hand and foot. If I glance for a stool, you fetch one. If I lick my lips, you have a cup of wine in
my hands before I know I am thirsty. You would wash my back and put the slippers on my feet if I let
you. I am neither monster nor invalid nor child, Nynaeve.”
“I am only trying to make up for—” she began timidly, and jumped when the other woman
roared.
“Make up? You are trying to make me less!”
“No. No, it is not that, truly. I am to blame—”
“You take responsibility for my actions,” Birgitte broke in fiercely. “I chose to speak to you in
Tel’aran’rhiod. I chose to help you. I chose to track Moghedien. And I chose to take you to see her.
Me! Not you, Nynaeve, me! I was not your puppet, your pack hound, then, and I will not be now.”
Nynaeve swallowed hard and gripped her skirts more tightly. She had no right to be angry with
this woman. No right at all. But Birgitte had every right. “You did what I asked. It is my fault that you
. . . that you are here. It is all my fault!”
“Have I mentioned fault? I see none. Only men and dim-witted girls take blame where there is
none, and you are neither.”
“It was my foolish pride that made me think I could best her again, and my cowardice that let her
. . . that let her . . . If I had not been so afraid I could not spit, I might have done something in time.”
“A coward?” Birgitte’s eyes widened, openly incredulous, and scorn touched her voice. “You? I
thought you had more sense than to confuse fear with cowardice. You could have fled Tel’aran’rhiod
when Moghedien released you, but you stayed to fight. No fault or blame to you that you could not.”
Drawing a deep breath, she rubbed her forehead for a moment, then leaned forward intently again.
“Listen to me close, Nynaeve. I take no blame for what was done to you. I saw, but I could not twitch.
Had Moghedien tied you into a knot or cored you like an apple, still I would take no blame. I did
what I could, when I could. And you did the same.”
“It was not the same.” Nynaeve tried to take the heat out of her voice. “It was my fault that you
were there. My fault that you are here. If you . . .” She stopped to swallow again. “If you . . . miss . . .
when you shoot at me today, I want you to know that I will understand.”
“I do not miss where I aim,” Birgitte said dryly, “and where I aim will not be at you.” She began
taking things from one of the cabinets and laying them on the small table. Half-finished arrows,
scraped shafts, steel arrow points, stone glue pot, fine cord, gray goose feathers for fletchings. She
had said she would make her own bow, too, as soon as she could. Luca’s she called “a knot-riddled
branch broken from a cross-grained tree by a blind idiot in the middle of the night.”
“I liked you, Nynaeve,” she said as she laid everything out. “Thorns, warts and all. I no longer
do, as you are now . . .”
“You have no reason to like me, now,” Nynaeve said miserably, but the other woman spoke right
over her without looking up.
“. . . and I will not allow you to make me less, to make my decisions less, by claiming
responsibility for them. I have had few women friends, but most have had tempers like snowghosts.”
“I wish you could be my friend once more.” What under the Light was a snowghost? Something
from another Age, no doubt. “I would never try to make you less, Birgitte. I only—”
Birgitte paid her no mind, except to raise her voice. Her attention seemed all on her arrow
shafts. “I would like to like you again, whether you return the liking or not, but I cannot until you are
yourself again. I could live with you a milk-tongued sniveling wretch if that was what you were. I

take people as they are, not as I would like them to be, or else I leave them. But that is not what you
are, and I will not accept your reasons for playing at it. So. Clarine told me of your encounter with
Cerandin. Now I know what to do the next time you claim my decisions as your own.” She swished a
length of ashwood vigorously. “I am sure Latelle will be happy to provide the switch.”
Nynaeve forced her jaws to unclench, forced her tone as smooth as she could make it. “You have
a perfect right to do whatever you wish to me.” Her fists in her skirts quivered more than her voice.
“A touch of temper showing? Just at the edges?” Birgitte grinned at her, at once amused and
startlingly feral. “How long before it bursts into flame? I am willing to wear out any number of
switches, if need be.” The grin faded into seriousness. “I will make you see the right of this, or I will
drive you away. There is no other course. I cannot—will not—leave Elayne. That bond honors me,
and I will honor it, and her. And I will not allow you to think that you make my decisions, or made
them. I am myself, not an appendage to you. Now go away. I must finish these arrows if I am to have
even a few shafts that will fly true. I do not mean to kill you, and I would not have it happen by
accident.” Unstopping the glue pot, she bent over the table. “Do not forget to curtsy like a good girl on
your way out.”
Nynaeve made it as far as the foot of the steps before pounding her fist on her thigh in a fury.
How dare the woman? Did she think that she could just . . . ? Did she think that Nynaeve would put up
with . . . ? I thought she could do anything she wanted to you, a small voice whispered in her head.
I said she could kill me, she snarled at it, not humiliate me! Before much longer everybody would be
threatening her with that bloody Seanchan woman!
The wagons stood abandoned, except for a few rough-coated horse handlers for guards, near the
tall sprawling canvas fence erected to contain Luca’s show. From this large brown-grass meadow
half a mile from Samara the gray stone walls of the city were clearly visible, with squat towers at the
gates, and a few of the taller buildings showing roofs of thatch or tile. Outside the walls, villages of
huts and rude shanties sprouted like mushrooms in every direction, full of the Prophet’s followers,
and they had stripped every tree for miles either for building or for firewood.
The show’s entrance for patrons was on the other side, but two of the horse handlers, with stout
cudgels, stood on this side to discourage any who did not want to pay from entering as the performers
did. Nynaeve was almost upon them, striding as hard as she could and muttering angrily to herself,
when their idiotic grins made her realize that the shawl was still looped over her elbows. Her stare
wiped their faces blank. Only then did she cover herself properly, and slowly; she was not about to
have these louts think they could make her yelp and leap. The skinny one, with a nose that took up half
of his face, held the canvas flap aside, and she ducked through into pandemonium.
Everywhere people thronged, in noisy milling clusters of men and women and children, in
chattering streams flowing from one attraction to the next. All but the s’redit performed on raised
wooden stages Luca had had built. Cerandin’s boar-horses had the largest crowd, the huge gray
animals actually balancing on their forelegs, even the baby, long snouts curved up sinuously, while
Clarine’s dogs had the smallest, for all they did back-springs and flips over each others’ backs. A
good many people paused to stare at the lions and the hairy boarlike capars in their cages, the
strangely horned deer from Arafel and Saldaea and Arad Doman and the bright birds from the Light
knew where, and some waddling, brown-furred creatures with big eyes and round ears that sat
placidly eating leaves from branches gripped in their forepaws. Luca’s tale on where they came from
varied—she supposed he did not know—and he had not been able to make up a name for them that
pleased him. A huge snake from the marshes of Illian, four times as long as a man; earned nearly as
many gasps as the s’redit, although simply lying there, apparently asleep, but she was pleased to see

that Latelle’s bears, at the moment standing atop huge red wooden balls that they rolled in circles
with their feet, attracted few more than the dogs. Bears these people could see in their own forests,
even if these did have white faces.
Latelle sparkled in the afternoon sunlight in her black spangles. Cerandin glittered almost as
much in blue, and Clarine in green, though neither had quite as many sequins sewn on as Latelle, but
every last one of the dresses had a collar right up under the chin. Of course, Petra and the Chavanas
were performing attired only in bright blue breeches, but that was to show off their muscles. Only
understandable. The acrobats were standing one atop the other’s shoulders, four high. Not far from
them, the strongman took a long bar with a large iron ball at each end—two men were needed to hand
the thing up to him—and immediately began twirling it in his thick hands, even spinning the bar
around his neck and across his back.
Thom was juggling fire, and eating it as well. Eight flaming batons made a perfect circle: then
suddenly he had four in each hand, one sticking up from each cluster. Deftly popping each upraised
flaming end into his mouth in turn, he appeared to swallow, and took them out extinguished, looking
as if he had just had something tasty. Nynaeve could not fathom how he did not scorch his mustaches
off, much less burn his throat. A twist of his wrists, and the unlit batons folded into the lit like fans. A
moment later they were making two interlinked circles above his head. He wore the same brown coat
he always did, though Luca had given him a red one sewn with sequins. From the way Thorn’s bushy
eyebrows rose as she stalked past, he did not understand why she glared at him. His own coat,
indeed!
She hurried on toward the thick, impatiently buzzing crowd circled around the two tall poles
with the rope stretched tightly between. She had to use her elbows to reach the front row, though two
women did glare and snatch their men out of her way when the shawl slipped. She would have glared
back had she not been so busy blushing and covering herself. Luca was there, frowning as anxiously
as a husband outside a birthing room, next to a thick fellow with his head shaved except for a grizzled
topknot. She slipped in on the other side of Luca. The shaven-headed man had a villainous look; a
long scar sliced down his left cheek, and a patch over that eye was painted with a scowling red
replacement. Few of the men she had seen here were armed with more than a belt knife, but he wore a
sword strapped to his back, the long hilt rising above his right shoulder. He looked vaguely familiar
for some reason, but her mind was all on the highrope. Luca frowned at the shawl, smiled at her, and
tried to put an arm around her waist.
While he was still trying to catch his breath from her elbow and she was still getting her shawl
decently back in place, Juilin came staggering out of the crowd on the other side, conical red hat tilted
jauntily, coat half off one shoulder and a wooden mug in his fist slopping over the rim. With the
overcareful steps of a man whose head contains more wine than brains, he approached the rope
ladder leading up to one of the high platforms and stared at it.
“Go on!” someone shouted. “Break your fool neck!”
“Wait, friend,” Luca called, starting forward with smiles and flourishes of his cloak. “That is no
place for a man with a belly full of—”
Setting the mug on the ground, Juilin scampered up the ladder and stood swaying on the platform.
Nynaeve held her breath. The man had a head for heights, and well he should after a life of chasing
thieves across the rooftops of Tear, but still . . .
Juilin turned as if lost; he appeared too drunk to see or remember the ladder. His eyes fixed on
the rope. Tentatively, he put one foot onto the narrow span, then drew it back. Pushing the hat back to
scratch his head, he studied the taut rope, and abruptly brightened visibly. Slowly he got down on

hands and knees and crawled wobbling out onto the rope. Luca shouted for him to come down, and
the crowd roared with laughter.
Halfway across, Juilin stopped, swaying awkwardly, and peered back, his eyes latching onto the
mug he had left on the ground. Plainly he was considering how to get back to it. Slowly, with
exceeding care, he stood, facing the way he had come and wavering from side to side. A gasp rose
from the crowd as his foot slipped and he fell, somehow catching himself with one hand and a knee
hooked around the rope. Luca caught the Taraboner hat as it fell, shouting to everyone that the man
was mad, and whatever happened was no responsibility of his. Nynaeve pressed both hands tight
against her middle; she could imagine being up there, and even that was enough to make her feel ill.
The man was a fool. A pure bull-goose fool!
With an obvious effort, Juilin managed to catch the rope with his other hand, and pulled himself
along it hand-over-hand. To the far platform. Swaying from side to side, he brushed his coat, tried to
pull it straight and succeeded only in changing which shoulder hung down—and spotted his mug at the
floor of the other pole. Pointing to it gleefully, he stepped out onto the rope again.
This time at least half the onlookers shouted for him to go back, shouted that there was a ladder
behind him; the others only laughed uproariously, no doubt waiting for him to break his neck. He
walked across smoothly, slid down the rope ladder with his hands and feet on the outside, and
snatched up the wooden mug to take a deep drink. Not until Luca clapped the red hat on Juilin’s head
and they both bowed—Luca flourishing his cloak in such a way that Juilin was behind it half the time
—did the watchers realize that it had all been part of the show. A moment of silence, and then they
exploded with applause and cheers and laughter. Nynaeve had half-thought they might turn ugly after
being duped. The fellow with the topknot looked villainous even while laughing.
Leaving Juilin standing beside the ladder, Luca came back to stand between Nynaeve and the
man with the topknot. “I thought that would go well.” He sounded incredibly self-satisfied, and he
made little bows to the crowd as if he had been the one up on the rope.
Giving him a sour frown, she had no time to speak the acid comment on her tongue, because
Elayne came bounding through the crowd to stand beside Juilin with her arms upraised and one knee
bent.
Nynaeve’s mouth tightened, and she shifted her shawl irritably. Whatever she thought of the red
dress that she had found herself wearing without really knowing how, she was not sure that Elayne’s
costume was not worse. The Daughter-Heir of Andor was all in snow white, with a scattering of
white sequins sparkling on her short coat and snug breeches. Nynaeve had not really believed that
Elayne would actually appear in the clothes in public, but she had been too concerned over her own
attire to give her opinion. The coat and breeches made her think of Min. She had never approved of
Min wearing boy’s clothes, but the color and spangles made these even more—flagrant.
Juilin held the rope ladder for Elayne to climb, though there was no need. She went up as
adeptly as he could have. He vanished into the crowd as soon as she reached the top, where she
posed again, beaming at the thunderous applause as if at the adulation of her subjects. As she stepped
out onto the rope—somehow it seemed even thinner than when Juilin had been on it—Nynaeve all but
ceased breathing, and she stopped thinking of Elayne’s clothes, or her own, at all.
Elayne made her way out onto the rope, arms outstretched to either side, and she was not
channeling a platform of Air. Slowly she stepped her way across, one foot in front of the other, never
wavering, supported only by the rope. Channeling would be far too dangerous if Moghedien had even
a clue to where they were; the Forsaken or Black sisters could be in Samara, and they would be able
to feel the weave. And if they were not in Samara now, they might be soon. On the far platform,

Elayne paused to considerably more applause than Juilin had received—Nynaeve could not
understand that—and started back. Almost to the end, she pivoted smoothly, walked back halfway,
pivoted again. And wobbled, just catching herself. Nynaeve felt as though a hand had her by the
throat. At a slow steady pace, Elayne highwalked to the platform, once more posing to thunderous
shouts and clapping.
Nynaeve swallowed her heart and breathed again, raggedly, but she knew it was not over.
Raising her hands above her head, Elayne suddenly cartwheeled herself along the rope, black
tresses whipping, white-sheathed legs flashing in the sun. Nynaeve yelped and clutched Luca’s arm as
the girl reached the far platform, stumbled in landing and caught herself just short of going over the
edge.
“What’s the matter?” he murmured beneath the gasp rising from the crowd. “You’ve seen her do
this every evening since Sienda. And a good many other places, too, I would think.”
“Of course,” she said weakly. Eyes fixed on Elayne, she barely noticed the arm he slipped
around her shoulders, certainly not enough to do anything about it. She had tried to talk the girl into
feigning a sprained ankle, but Elayne insisted that after all of that practice with the Power, she did not
need it now. Maybe Juilin did not—apparently he did not—but Elayne had never gone scrambling
over rooftops in the night.
The return cartwheels went perfectly, and the landing, but Nynaeve did not look away, or loose
her hold on Luca’s sleeve. After what now seemed the inevitable pause for applause, Elayne returned
to the rope for more pivots, one leg raised and whipping down and up so quickly that it seemed she
kept it outstretched the whole while, and for a slow handstand that lifted her straight as a dagger,
white-slippered toes pointed to the sky. And a backflip that had the crowd gasping and her swaying
from side to side, only just catching her balance. Thom Merrilin had taught her that, and the
handstand.
From the corner of her eye Nynaeve caught Thom, two places down from her, eyes riveted to
Elayne, poised on the balls of his feet. He looked as proud as a peacock. He looked ready to rush
forward and catch her if she fell. If she did fall, it would be at least partly his fault. He should never
have taught her those things!
One last passage of cartwheels, white legs flashing and glittering in the sun, faster than before. A
passage that had never been mentioned to Nynaeve! She would have eviscerated Luca with her tongue
had he not muttered angrily that Elayne adding to the act just for applause was a good way to break
her neck. One last pause to pose for more of that applause, and Elayne at last climbed down.
Shouting, the crowd rushed in on her. Luca and four horse handlers with cudgels appeared
around her as if by the Power, but even so Thom beat them to her, limp and all.
Nynaeve jumped as high as she could, just managing to see over enough heads to make out
Elayne. The girl did not seem frightened, or even taken aback, by all the waving hands trying to touch
her, stretching between her encircling guards. Head high, face flushed from effort, she still managed a
cool and regal grace as she was escorted away. How she could do that, garbed as she was, Nynaeve
simply could not imagine.
“Face like a bloody queen,” the one-eyed man muttered to himself. He had not gone running with
the others, but merely let them stream past. Roughly dressed in a plain coat of dark gray wool, he
certainly looked solid enough to have no fears of being knocked down and trampled. He appeared as
if he could use that sword. “Burn me for a sheep-gutted farmer, but she’s flaming well brave enough
for a bloody queen.”
Nynaeve gaped at him as he strode away through the crowd, and it was not his language. Or

rather, it was, partly. Now she remembered where she had seen him, a one-eyed man with a topknot
who could not say two sentences without the vilest curses.
Forgetting about Elayne—she was certainly safe enough—Nynaeve began pushing her way
through the throng after him.

CHAPTER
38

An Old Acquaintance

With the crowds, it took Nynaeve some little time to catch up, muttering every time she was
jostled by a man gaping at everything in sight or a woman dragging a child with either hand, children
usually trying to drag her to two different attractions at once. The one-eyed man barely paused to look
at anything except the big snake and the lions, until he reached the boar-horses. He had to have seen
them earlier, situated as they were near the patrons’ entrance. Every time the s’redit stood on their
hind legs, as they were doing now, the great tusked heads of the adults could be seen by those outside
the canvas fence, and the press to enter intensified a little more.
Beneath a wide red sign that said VALAN LUCA in ornate gold script on both sides, two of the horse
handlers collected admission from people funneled between two thick ropes, taking the money in
clear blown-glass pitchers—both thick and flawed; Luca would never lay out coin for better—so they
could see that the coins were right without touching them. They dumped the money straight from the
pitchers through a hole in the top of an iron-strapped box so wrapped about with chain that Petra had
to have put it in place before the first silver penny went in. Another pair of horse handlers—thickshouldered, broken-nosed men with the sunken knuckles of brawlers—stood nearby with cudgels to
make sure that the crowd remained orderly. And to keep an eye on the men taking the money, Nynaeve
suspected. Luca was not a trusting man, especially when it came to coin. In fact, he was as tight as the
skin on an apple. She had never met anyone so stingy.
Slowly she elbowed close to the man with the gray-streaked topknot. He had had no trouble
reaching the front rank before the s’redit, of course; his scar and painted eyepatch would have seen to
that, even without the sword on his back. At the moment he was watching the big gray animals with a
grin and what she supposed was wonder on that stony face.
“Uno?” She thought that was the right name.
His head turned to stare at her. Once she had the shawl back in place, he raised the stare to her
face, but no recognition lit in his dark eye. The other, the painted red glaring one, made her a little
queasy.
Cerandin waved her goad, shouting something slurred beyond intelligibility, and the s’redit
turned; Sanit, the cow, placing her feet on Mer’s broad, rounded back while he remained upright.
Nerin, the calf, put her feet low on Sanit’s back.
“I saw you in Fal Dara,” Nynaeve said. “And again on Toman Head, briefly. After Falme. You
were with . . .” She did not know how much she could say with people cheek-by-jowl around her;
rumors of the Dragon Reborn had circulated all through Amadicia, and some even had his name right.
“With Rand.”
Uno’s real eye narrowed—she tried not to see the other—and after a moment he nodded. “I

remember the face. I never forget a flaming pretty face. But the hair was bloody well different.
Nyna?”
“Nynaeve,” she told him sharply.
He shook his head, eyeing her up and down, and before she could say another word, he had
seized her arm and was all but dragging her out through the entrance.
The horse handlers there recognized her, of course, and the broken-nosed fellows started
forward hefting their cudgels. She waved them away furiously even as she was yanking her arm free;
it took three tries, and still it was more a matter of his letting go. The man had a grip like iron. The
men with the clubs hesitated, then drifted back to their places when they saw Uno drop his grip.
Apparently they knew what Valan Luca would prefer them to be guarding.
“What do you think you are doing?” she demanded, but Uno only motioned her to follow,
watching to see that she did so without more than slowing his stride through the crowd waiting to get
in. He had slightly bowed legs, and moved like a man more used to the back of a horse than his own
feet. Growling to herself, she picked up her skirts and stalked after him toward the town.
Two other menageries were set up behind brown canvas walls not far off, and beyond them
more lay scattered among the crowded shanty villages. None too close to the city walls, though.
Apparently the governor, as they called the woman Nynaeve could have named mayor—though she
had never heard of a woman mayor—had decreed half a mile as the distance, to protect the town in
case any of the animals got loose.
The sign over the entrance to the nearest show said M AIRIN GOM E in florid green and gold. Two
women were clearly visible above the sign, clinging to a rope hanging from a tall framework of poles
that had not been there when Luca’s walls went up. Apparently the boar-horses’ rearing high enough
to be seen was having an effect. The women contorted themselves into positions that made Nynaeve
think uncomfortably of what Moghedien had done, and somehow even managed to hold themselves
out in horizontal handstands to either side of the rope. The crowd waiting impatiently in front of
Mistress Gome’s sign was almost as large as the one in front of Luca’s. None of the other shows had
anything visible that she could see, and their crowds were much smaller.
Uno refused to answer her questions or say a word or do more than give her dire frowns until
they were out of the jam of people and onto a cart path of hard-packed dirt. “What I am flaming trying
to do,” he growled then, “is to take you where we can flaming well talk without you being torn to
flaming bits by flaming folk trying to kiss your flaming hem when they find out you flaming know the
Lord Dragon.” There was no one within thirty paces of them, but he still stared around for anyone
who might hear. “Blood and bloody ashes, woman! Don’t you know what these flaming goat-heads
are like? Half of them think the Creator talks to him over bloody supper every night, and the other half
think he is the bloody Creator!”
“I will thank you to moderate your language, Master Uno. And I will thank you to slow down,
too. We are not running a footrace. Where are you going, and why should I stir another step with
you?”
He rolled his eye toward her, chuckling wryly. “Oh, I do remember you. The one with the fla—
the mouth. Ragan thought you could skin and butcher a blo—a bull at ten paces with your tongue.
Chaena and Nangu thought fifty.” At least he did shorten his stride.
Nynaeve stopped dead. “Where and why?”
“Into the town.” He did not stop. He strode right on, flipping a hand for her to follow. “I don’t
know what you’re flam—what you’re doing here, but I remember you were mixed up with that blue
woman.”

Snarling under her breath, she gathered her skirts and hurried after him again; it was the only
way to hear. He continued as if she had been beside him the whole time. “This is no blood—no place
for you to be. I can scrape together enough bio—aagh!—enough coin to get you to Tear, I think.
Rumor says that’s where the Lord Dragon is.” Again he looked around warily. “Unless you want to go
to the island instead.” He must have meant Tar Valon. “There’s blo—there’s odd rumors floating
around about that, too. Peace, if there aren’t!” He came from a land that had not known peace in three
thousand years; Shienarans used the word as talisman and oath both. “They say the old Amyrlin’s
been deposed. Executed maybe. Some say they fought and burned the whole—” He paused, taking a
deep breath and grimacing horribly. “—the whole city.”
Walking along, she studied him in amazement. She had not seen him in nearly a year, had never
spoken more than two words together to him, and yet he . . . Why did men always think a woman
needed a man to look after her? Men could not lace up their own shirts without a woman to help! “We
are doing quite well as we are, thank you. Unless you know when a river trader will dock on his way
downriver.”
“We? Is the blue woman with you, or the brown?” That had to be Moiraine and Verin. He was
certainly being cautious.
“No. Do you remember Elayne?” He gave a blunt nod, and a mischievous impulse seized her;
nothing seemed to faze the man, and he obviously expected to just take charge of her welfare. “You
saw her again just now. You said she had a”—she made her voice gruff in imitation of his—“face
like a bloody queen.”
He stumbled in a quite satisfactory way, and glared around him so fiercely that even two
Whitecloaks riding by skirted wide around him, though they tried to pretend he had nothing to do with
it, of course. “Her?” he growled incredulously. “But her bloody hair was black as a raven’s. . . .” He
glanced athers, and the next minute he was pacing up the cart path again, muttering half to himself,
“The flaming woman is daughter to a queen. A bloody queen! Showing her bloody legs that way.”
Nynaeve nodded in agreement. Until he added, “You bloody southlanders are bloody strange! No
flaming decency at all!” He had fine room to talk. Shienarans might dress properly, but she still
blushed to remember that in Shienar men and women bathed together as often as not, and thought no
more of it than of eating together.
“Did your mother never teach you to talk decently, man?” His real eye frowned at her almost as
darkly as the painted one, and he rolled his shoulders. In Fal Dara he and everyone else had treated
her as nobly born, or the next thing to. Of course, it was hard to pass herself off as a lady in that dress,
and with her hair a shade that nature never made. She arranged her shawl more snugly and folded her
arms to hold it in place. The gray wool was terribly uncomfortable in that dry heat, and she herself
was not feeling very dry at all; she had never heard of anyone who died of sweating, but she thought
she might well be the first. “What are you doing here, Uno?”
He looked around before answering. Not that he had need; there was little traffic on the path—an
occasional ox-drawn cart, a few folk in farm clothes or rougher, here and there a man on a horse—
and no one seemed willing to come any closer to him than they had to. He appeared a man who might
cut somebody’s throat on a whim. “The blue woman gave us a name in Jehannah, and said we were to
wait there until she sent instructions, but the woman in Jehannah was dead and buried when we
arrived. An old woman. Died in her sleep, and none of her relatives had ever heard the blue woman’s
name. Then Masema started talking to people, and . . . Well, there was no point staying there for
orders we’d never hear if they did come. We stay close to Masema because he slips us enough to live
on, though none except Bartu and Nengar listen to his trash.” The grizzled topknot swung as he shook

his head in irritation.
Suddenly Nynaeve realized that there had not been a single obscene word in that. He looked
about to swallow his tongue. “Perhaps if you cursed only occasionally?” She sighed. “Maybe once
every other sentence?” The man smiled at her so gratefully that she wanted to throw up her hands in
exasperation. “How is it that Masema has money when the rest of you do not?” She remembered
Masema: a dark sour man who liked no one and nothing.
“Why, he’s the bloody Prophet they’ve all come to hear. Would you like to meet him?” He gave
the impression of counting his sentences. Nynaeve breathed deeply; the man was going to take her
literally. “He might find you a flaming boat, if you want one. In Ghealdan, what the Prophet wants, the
Prophet usually gets. No, he always flaming gets it in the end, one way or another. The man was a
good soldier, but who’d have ever thought he would turn out like this?” His frown took in all the rude
villages and the people, even the shows and the city ahead.
Nynaeve hesitated. The dreaded Prophet, rousing mobs and riots, was Masema? But hedid
preach the coming of the Dragon Reborn. They were almost to the town gate, and there was time yet
before she must stand up and let Birgitte shoot arrows at her. Luca had been more than disappointed
that the woman insisted on being called Maerion. If Masema could find a boat heading downriver . . .
Today, maybe. On the other hand, there were the riots. If rumor inflated them tenfold, then only
hundreds had died in towns and cities farther north. Only hundreds.
“Just don’t remind him that you have anything to do with that bloody island,” Uno went on,
eyeing her thoughtfully. Now that she thought of it, she realized that he very likely did not know what
her connection to Tar Valon actually was. Women did go there without becoming Aes Sedai, after all,
to seek help or answers. He was aware that she was involved in some way, but no more than that.
“He isn’t much friendlier to women from there than the Whitecloaks are. If you just keep your mouth
bloody well shut about it, he’ll likely pass it over. For somebody who comes from the same village
as the Lord Dragon, Masema will probably have a flaming boat built.”
The crowds were thicker at the city gates, flanked by squat gray towers, men and women
streaming in and out, afoot and mounted, in every sort of garb from rags to embroidered silk coats and
dresses. The gates themselves, thick and iron-bound, stood open under the guard of a dozen spearmen
in scaled tunics and round steel caps with flat rims. Actually, the guards paid more attention to half
their number of Whitecloaks lounging nearby than to anything else. It was the men in snowy cloaks
and burnished mail who watched the flow of people.
“Do the Whitecloaks cause much trouble?” she asked quietly.
Uno pursed his lips as if to spit, glanced at her, and did not. “Where do they bloody not? There
was a woman with one of these traveling shows who did tricks, sleight of hand. Four days ago a
flaming mob of pigeon-gutted sheep-heads tore the show apart.” Valan Luca had certainly never
mentioned that! “Peace! What they wanted was the woman. Claimed she was”—he glowered at the
folk hurrying by, and lowered his voice—“Aes Sedai. And a Darkfriend. Broke her bloody neck
getting her to a rope, so I hear, but they hung her corpse anyway. Masema had the ringleaders
beheaded, but it was Whitecloaks whipped up the bloody mob.” His scowl matched the red eye
painted on his patch. “There’s been too many flaming hangings and beheadings, if you bloody well
ask me. Bloody Masema’s as bad as the bloody Whitecloaks when it comes to finding a Darkfriend
under every flaming rock.”
“Once every other sentence,” she murmured, and the man actually blushed.
“Don’t know what I’m thinking,” he grumped, coming to a stop. “Can’t take you in there. It’s half
festival and half riot, with a cutpurse every third step and a woman not safe out-of-doors after dark.”

He sounded more scandalized about the last than the rest; in Shienar, a woman was safe anywhere,
any time—except from Trollocs and Myrddraal, of course—and any man would die to see it so. “Not
safe. I’ll take you back. When I find a way, I’ll come for you.”
That settled it for her. Pulling her arm loose before he could get a grip on it, she quickened her
pace toward the gates. “Come along, Uno, and do not dawdle. If you dawdle, I will leave you
behind.” He caught up to her, grumbling under his breath about the stubbornness of women. Once she
understood that that was his subject, and that apparently he did not think her injunction against cursing
held when talking to himself, she stopped listening.

Encounters in Samara

The Whitecloaks at the gates gave Uno and Nynaeve no more mind than they gave anyone else
in the steady throng, which was to say a cold suspicious stare, searching yet quick. Too many people
made anything else impossible, and maybe the scale-armored guards did, too. Not that there was any
reason for more except in her mind. Her Great Serpent ring and Lan’s heavy gold ring both nestled in
her pouch—the dress’s low neckline meant she could not wear them on the thong—but somehow she
almost expected Children of the Light to pick out a Tower-trained woman by instinct. Her relief was
palpable when those icy, unfeeling eyes swept past her.
The soldiers paid the two of them as little attention—once she rearranged her shawl yet again.
Uno’s scowl might have helped send their eyes back to the Whitecloaks, but the man had no right to
scowl in the first place. It was her business.
Rewrapping the folded length of gray wool one more time, she tied the ends around her waist.
The shawl defined her bosom more than she wished, and still exposed a bit of cleavage, yet it was a
considerable improvement on the dress alone. At least she would not have to worry about the shawl
slipping again. If only the thing were not so hot. The weather really should be turning soon. They
were not that far south of the Two Rivers.
Uno patiently waited on her for a change. She was of two minds as to whether this was simple
courtesy—his scarred face looked a deal too patient—but finally they walked together into Samara.
Into chaos.
A babble of noise hung over everything, no one sound distinguishable. People jammed the rough
stone-paved streets all but shoulder to shoulder from slate-roofed taverns to thatch-roofed stables,
from raucous inns with simple painted signs like The Blue Bull or The Dancing Goose to shops
where the signs had no words, only a knife-and-scissors here, a bolt of cloth there, a goldsmith’s
scales or a barber’s razor, a pot or a lamp or a boot. Nynaeve saw faces as pale as that of any
Andorman and as dark as that of any of the Sea Folk, some clean, some dirty, and coats with high
collars, low collars, no collars, drably colored and bright, plain and embroidered, shabby and near
new-made, in styles strange as often as familiar. One fellow with a dark forked beard wore silver
chains across the chest of his plain blue coat, and two with their hair in braids—men, with a black
braid over each ear below their shoulders!—had tiny brass bells sewn to their red coatsleeves and
the turned-down tops of thigh-high boots. Whatever land they hailed from, those two were not fools;
their dark eyes were hard and searching as Uno’s, and they carried curved swords on their backs. A
bare-chested man in a bright yellow sash, skin a deeper brown than aged wood and hands intricately
tattooed, had to be one of the Sea Folk, though he wore neither earrings nor nose ring.
The women were equally as diverse, hair ranging from raven black to yellow so pale it was
nearly white, braided or gathered or hanging loose, cut short, to the shoulders, to the waist, dresses in

worn wool or neat linen or shimmering silk, collars brushing chins with lace or embroidery and
necklines every bit as low as the one she hid. She even saw a copper-complexioned Domani woman
in a barely opaque red gown that covered her to the neck and hid next to nothing! She wondered how
safe that woman would be after dark. Or in this broad daylight, for that matter.
The occasional Whitecloaks and soldiers in that milling mass seemed overwhelmed, struggling
to make ground as hard as anyone else. Ox-carts and horse-drawn wagons inched along the
haphazardly crisscrossing streets, bearers jostled sedan chairs through the crowds, and now and then
a lacquered coach with a plumed team of four or six made its laborious way, liveried footman and
steel-capped guards vainly trying to clear a path. Musicians with flute or zither or bittern played at
every corner where there was not a juggler or an acrobat—their skill certainly nothing to make Thom
or the Chavanas worry—always with another man or woman holding out a cap for coins. Ragged
beggars wove through it all, plucking at sleeves and proffering grimy hands, and hawkers bustled with
trays of everything from pins to ribbons to pears, their cries lost in the din.
Her head spun by the time Uno drew her into a narrower street where the throng seemed thinner,
if only by comparison. She paused to straighten her clothes, disarrayed from plunging through the
crowd, before following him. It was a trifle quieter here, too. No street entertainers, and fewer
hawkers and beggars. Beggars kept clear of Uno, even after he tossed a few coppers to a wary pack
of urchins, for which she did not blame them. The man just did not look . . . charitable.
The town’s buildings loomed over these narrow ways, despite being only two or three stories,
putting the streets themselves in shadow. But there was good light in the sky, hours yet till dusk. Still
plenty of time to get back to the show. If she had to. With luck, they could all be boarding a riverboat
by sunset.
She gave a start when another Shienaran suddenly joined them, sword on his back and head
shaven but for that topknot, a dark-haired man only a few years older than she. Uno gave curt
introductions and explanation without slowing.
“Peace favor you, Nynaeve,” Ragan said, the skin of his dark cheek dimpling around a triangular
white scar. Even smiling, his face was hard; she had never met a soft Shienaran. Soft men did not
survive along the Blight, nor soft women either. “I remember you. Your hair was different, was it not?
No matter. Never fear. We will see you safely to Masema and to wherever you would go after. Just
be sure not to mention Tar Valon to him.” No one was sparing them a second glance, but he lowered
his voice anyway. “Masema thinks the Tower will try to control the Lord Dragon.”
Nynaeve shook her head. Another fool man who was going to take care of her. At least he did
not try to engage her in conversation; the mood she was in, she would have given him the rough side
of her tongue if he so much as commented on the heat. Her own face felt a trifle damp, and no wonder,
having to wear a shawl in this weather. Abruptly she remembered what the one-eyed man had said
concerning Ragan’s opinion of her tongue. She did not think she more than glanced at him, but Ragan
moved to the other side of Uno as if for shelter and eyed her warily. Men!
The streets grew still narrower, and though the stone buildings lining them did not grow smaller,
it was more often than not the backs of the buildings they saw, and rough gray walls that could hide
only small yards. Eventually they turned down an alley barely wide enough for all three of them
abreast. At the far end, a lacquered and gilded coach stood surrounded by scale-armored men. More
immediately, halfway between her and the coach, fellows lounged thickly along both sides of the
alley. In a motley of coats, most clutched clubs or spears or swords as different as their garb. They
could have been a pack of street toughs, but neither of the Shienarans slowed, so she did not either.
“The street out front will be full of bloody fools hoping to catch a glimpse of Masema at a

bloody window.” Uno’s voice was pitched for her ears alone. “The only way to get in is by the
back.” He fell silent as they came close enough for the waiting men to hear.
Two of those were soldiers with rimmed steel helmets and scaled tunics, swords at hip and
spears in hand, but it was the others who studied the three newcomers and fingered their weapons.
They had disturbing eyes, too intent, almost feverish. For once, she would have been pleased to see
an honest leer. These men did not care whether she was a woman or a horse.
Without a word Uno and Ragan unfastened the scabbarded blades from their backs and handed
them and their daggers to a plump-faced man who might have been a shopkeeper once, from the look
of his blue woolen coat and breeches. The clothing had been good; it was clean, but heavily worn,
and wrinkled as if it had been slept in for a month. Plainly he recognized the Shienarans, and though
he frowned at her for a moment, especially at her belt knife, he silently nodded to a narrow wooden
gate in the stone wall. That was perhaps the most off-putting fact of all; none of them made a sound.
On the other side of wall was a small yard where weeds stuck up between cobblestones. The
tall stone house—three broad, pale-gray stories, with wide windows and scroll-worked eaves and
gables, roofed in dark red tiles—must have been one of the finest in Samara. Once the gate was
closed behind them, Ragan spoke softly. “There have been attempts to kill the Prophet.”
It took Nynaeve a moment to realize that he was explaining why their weapons had been taken.
“But you are his friends,” she protested. “You all followed Rand to Falme together.” She was not
about to start calling him the Lord Dragon.
“That’s why we’re bloody let in at all,” Uno said dryly. “I told you we don’t see everything the
way . . . the Prophet does.” The slight pause, and the quick half-glance back at the gate to see if
anyone was listening, spoke volumes. It had been Masema, before. And Uno was clearly a man who
did not temper his tongue easily.
“Just watch what you say for once,” Ragan told her, “and likely you will get the help you want.”
She nodded, as agreeably as anyone could wish—she knew sense when she heard it, even if he had no
right to offer it—and he and Uno exchanged doubtful glances. She was going to stuff these two into a
sack with Thom and Juilin and switch anything that stuck up.
Fine house as it might be, the kitchen was dusty, and empty except for one bony, gray-haired
woman, her drab gray dress and white apron the only clean things in sight as they walked through.
Sucking her teeth, the old woman hardly glanced up from stirring a small kettle of soup over a tiny
blaze in one of the wide stone fireplaces. Two battered pots hung on hooks where twenty could have,
and a cracked pottery bowl on a blue-lacquered tray stood on the broad table.
Beyond the kitchen, moderately fine hangings decorated the walls. Nynaeve had developed
something of an eye in the last year, and these scenes of feasts and hunts for deer and bear and boar
were only good, not excellent. Chairs and tables and chests lined the halls, dark lacquer streaked with
red, inlaid with mother-of-pearl. Hangings and furniture alike were also dusty, and the red-and-whitetiled floor had had only a halfhearted lick with a broom. Cobwebs decorated the corners and cornices
of the high plaster ceiling.
There were no other servants—or anyone else—in sight until they came to a weedy fellow
sitting on the floor beside an open door, his grimy red silk coat much too large for him and at odds
with a filthy shirt and worn woolen breeches. One of his cracked boots had a large hole in the sole; a
toe poked through another in the other one. He held up a hand, whispering, “The Light shine on you,
and praise the name of the Lord Dragon?” He made it sound a question, querulously twisting a narrow
face as unwashed as his shirt, but then he did the same with everything. “The Prophet can’t be
disturbed now? He’s busy? You’ll have to wait a bit?” Uno nodded patiently, and Ragan leaned

against the wall; they had been through this before.
Nynaeve did not know what she had expected of the Prophet, not even now that she was aware
who he was, but certainly not filth. That soup had smelled like cabbage and potatoes, hardly the fare
for a man who had an entire city dancing for him. And only two servants, both of whom could well
have come from the rudest huts outside the city.
The skinny guard, if such he was—he had no weapon; perhaps he was not trusted either—
seemed to have no objection when she moved to where she could see through the doorway. The man
and woman inside could not have been more different. Masema had shaved even his topknot, and his
coat was plain brown wool, heavily wrinkled but clean, although his knee-high boots were scuffed.
Deep-set eyes turned his permanently sour look to a scowl, and a scar made a pale triangle on his
dark cheek, a near mirror image of Ragan’s, only more faded with age and a hair nearer the eye. The
woman, in elegantly gold-embroidered blue silk, was short of her middle years and quite lovely
despite a nose perhaps too long for beauty. A simple blue net cap gathered dark hair spilling almost
to her waist, but she wore a broad necklace of gold and firedrops with a matching bracelet, and
gemmed rings decorated nearly every finger. Where Masema seemed poised to rush at something,
teeth bared, she bore herself with stately reserve and grace.
“. . . so many follow wherever you go,” she was saying, “that order flies over the wall when you
arrive. People are not safe in themselves or their property—”
“The Lord Dragon has broken all bonds of law, all bonds made by mortal men and women.”
Masema’s voice was heated, but intense, not angry. “The Prophecies say that the Lord Dragon will
break all chains that bind, and it is so. The Lord Dragon’s radiance will protect us against the
Shadow.”
“It is not the Shadow that threatens here, but cutpurses and slipfingers and headcrackers. Some
who follow you—many—believe that they can take what they wish from whoever has it without
payment or leave.”
“There is justice in the hereafter, when we are born again. Concern with things of this world is
useless. But very well. If you wish earthly justice”—his lip curled contemptuously—“let it be this.
Henceforth, a man who steals will have his right hand cut off. A man who interferes with a woman, or
insults her honor, or commits murder will be hung. A woman who steals or commits murder will be
flogged. If any accuses and finds twelve who will agree, it will be done. Let it be so.”
“As you say, of course,” the woman murmured. Aloof elegance remained on her face, but she
sounded shaken. Nynaeve did not know how Ghealdanin law ran, but she did not think it could be so
casual as that. The woman took a deep breath. “There is still the matter of food. It becomes difficult
to feed so many.”
“Every man, woman and child who has come to the Lord Dragon must have a full belly. It must
be so! Where gold can be found, food can be found, and there is too much gold in the world. Too
much concern with gold.” Masema’s head swung angrily. Not angry with her, but in general. He
looked to be searching for those who concerned themselves with gold so he could unleash fury on
their heads. “The Lord Dragon has been Reborn. The Shadow hangs over the world, and only the
Lord Dragon can save us. Only belief in the Lord Dragon, submission and obedience to the word of
the Lord Dragon. All else is useless, even where it is not blasphemy.”
“Blessed be the name of the Lord Dragon in the Light.” It had the sound of a rote reply. “It is no
longer simply a matter of gold, my Lord Prophet. Finding and transporting food in sufficient—”
“I am not a lord,” he broke in again, and now he was angry. He leaned toward the woman, spittle
on his lips, and though her face did not change, her hands twitched as if they wanted to clutch her

dress. “There is no lord but the Lord Dragon, in whom the Light dwells, and I am but one humble
voice of the Lord Dragon. Remember that! High or low, blasphemers earn the scourge!”
“Forgive me,” the begemmed woman murmured, spreading her skirts in a curtsy fit for a queen’s
court. “It is as you say, of course. There is no lord save the Lord Dragon, and I am but a humble
follower of the Lord Dragon—blessed be the name of the Lord Dragon—who comes to hear the
wisdom and guidance of the Prophet.”
Wiping his mouth with the back of his hand, Masema was suddenly cold. “You wear too much
gold. Do not let earthly possessions seduce you. Gold is dross. The Lord Dragon is all.”
Immediately she began plucking rings from her fingers, and before the second was off, the weedy
fellow scurried to her side, pulling a pouch from his coat pocket and holding it for her to drop them
in. The bracelet and necklace followed as well.
Nynaeve looked at Uno and raised an eyebrow.
“Every penny goes to the poor,” he told her in a low voice that barely reached her ear, “or
somebody who needs it. If some merchant hadn’t bloody given him her house, he’d be in a bloody
stable, or one of those huts outside the city.”
“Even his food comes as a gift,” Ragan said just as quietly. “They used to bring him dishes fit
for a king, until they learned he just gave away everything but a little bread, and soup or stew. He
hardly drinks wine, now.”
Nynaeve shook her head. She supposed it was one way to find money for the poor. Simply rob
anyone who was not poor. Of course, that would just make everyone poor in the end, but it might
work for a time. She wondered if Uno and Ragan knew the whole of it. People who claimed they
were collecting money to help others often had a way of letting a good bit stick in their own pockets,
or else they liked the power that spreading it about gave them, liked it far too much. She had better
feeling for the man who freely gave one copper from his own purse than for the fellow who wrested a
gold crown from someone else’s. And less for fools who abandoned their farms and shops to follow
this . . . this Prophet, with no idea where their next meal would come from.
Inside the room, the woman curtsied to Masema even more deeply than before, spreading her
skirts wide and bowing her head. “Until I once again have the honor of the Prophet’s words and
counsel. The name of the Lord Dragon be blessed in the Light.”
Masema waved her away absently, already half forgotten. He had seen them in the hall, and was
looking at them with as close to pleasure as his dour face could come. It was not very close. The
woman swept out, not even appearing to see Nynaeve or the two men. Nynaeve sniffed as the weedy
fellow in the red coat waved anxiously for them to come in. For someone who had just given up her
jewelry on demand, that woman managed a fine queenly air.
The skinny man scampered back to his place by the door as the other three men shook hands in
the Borderlands fashion, gripping forearms.
“Peace favor your sword,” Uno said, echoed by Ragan.
“Peace favor the Lord Dragon” was the reply, “and his Light illumine us all.” Nynaeve’s breath
caught. There was no doubt to his meaning; the Lord Dragon was the source of the Light. And he had
the nerve to speak of blasphemy from others! “Have you come to the Light at last?”
“We walk in the Light,” Ragan said carefully. “As always.” Uno kept silent, his face blank.
Weary patience made an odd play on Masema’s sour features. “There is no way to the Light save
through the Lord Dragon. You will see the way and the truth in the end, for you have seen the Lord
Dragon, and only those whose souls are swallowed in the Shadow can see and not believe. You are
not such. You will believe.”

In spite of the heat and the wool shawl, goose bumps crawled along Nynaeve’s arms. Total
conviction filled the man’s voice, and this close she could see a glint in his nearly black eyes that
bordered on madness. He swept those eyes over her, and she stiffened her knees. He made the most
rabid Whitecloak she had ever seen appear mild. Those fellows in the alley were only a pale
imitation of their master.
“You, woman. Are you ready to come to the Light of the Lord Dragon, abandoning sin and
flesh?”
“I walk in the Light as best I can.” She was irritated to find herself speaking as carefully as
Ragan. Sin? Who did he think he was?
“You are too concerned with the flesh.” Masema’s gaze was withering as it swept over her red
dress and the shawl wrapped tightly around her.
“And what do you mean by that?” Uno’s eye widened in startlement, and Ragan made small
shushing motions, yet she could as soon have flown as stopped. “Do you think you have a right to tell
me how to dress?” Before she quite realized what she was doing, she had untied the shawl and
looped it over her elbows; it really was much too hot, anyway. “No man has that right, for me or any
other woman! If I chose to go naked, it would be none of your concern!”
Masema contemplated her bosom for a moment—not so much as a hint of admiration lit his deep
eyes, only acid contempt—then raised that stare to her face. Uno’s real eye and painted made a
perfect match, scowling at nothing, and Ragan winced, surely muttering to himself inside his head.
Nynaeve swallowed hard. So much for guarding her tongue. For perhaps the first time in her life,
she truly regretted speaking her mind without thinking first. If this man could order men’s hands cut
off, order men hanged, with only a jack-fool excuse of a trial, what was he not capable of? She
thought she was angry enough to channel.
But if she did . . . If Moghedien or any Black sisters were in Samara . . . But if I don’t . . . ! She
wanted very much to wrap the shawl back around her, up to her chin. But not with him staring at her.
Something in the back of her mind shouted at her not to be a complete woolhead—only men let pride
overcome sense—but she met Masema’s gaze defiantly, even if she did have to stop herself from
swallowing again.
His lip curled. “Such garments are worn to entice men, and for no other reason.” She could not
understand how his voice could be so fervent and so icy at the same time. “Thoughts of the flesh
distract the mind from the Lord Dragon and the Light. I have considered banning dresses that distract
men’s eyes, and minds. Let women who would waste time in attracting men, and men who would
attract women, be scourged until they know that only in perfect contemplation of the Lord Dragon and
the Light can joy be found.” He was not really looking at her any longer. That dark burning stare
looked through her, to something distant. “Let taverns, and places that sell strong drink, and all places
that would take the minds of people from that perfect contemplation, be closed and burned to the
ground. I frequented such places in my days of sin, but now I heartily regret, as all should regret their
transgressions. There is only the Lord Dragon and the Light! All else is illusion, a snare set by the
Shadow!”
“This is Nynaeve al’Meara,” Uno said quickly into the first pause for breath. “From Emond’s
Field, in the Two Rivers, whence the Lord Dragon comes.” Masema’s head turned slowly to the oneeyed man, and she hastily took the opportunity to re-do the shawl as she had had it. “She was at Fal
Dara with the Lord Dragon, and at Falme. The Lord Dragon rescued her at Falme. The Lord Dragon
cares for her as for a mother.”
Another time, she would have given him a few choice words, and maybe a well-boxed ear. Rand

had not rescued her—or not exactly, anyway—and she was only a handful of years older than he. A
mother, indeed!
Masema turned back to her. The zealous light that had burned in his eyes before was nothing to
what was there now. They almost glowed.
“Nynaeve. Yes.” His voice quickened. “Yes! I remember your name, and your face. Blessed are
you among women, Nynaeve al’Meara, none more so save the blessed mother of the Lord Dragon
herself, for you watched the Lord Dragon grow. You attended the Lord Dragon as a child.” He seized
her arms, hard fingers biting in painfully, but he seemed unaware of it. “You will speak to the crowds
of the Lord Dragon’s boyhood, of his first words of wisdom, of the miracles that accompanied him.
The Light has sent you here to serve the Lord Dragon.”
She was not exactly sure what to say. There had never been any miracles around Rand that she
had seen. She had heard of things, in Tear, but you could hardly call what a ta’veren caused
miracles. Not really. Even what had occurred at Falme had a rational explanation. Sort of. And as for
words of wisdom, the first she had heard out of him had been a fervent promise never to throw a rock
at anyone again, offered after she had paddled his young backside for it. She did not believe she had
heard another word since that she could call wise. In any case, if Rand had given sage advice from
his cradle, if there had been comets by night and apparitions in the sky by day, she still would not
have stayed with this madman.
“I must travel downriver,” she said guardedly. “To join him. The Lord Dragon.” That name
curdled on her tongue, so soon after her promise to herself, but Rand was apparently never anything
as simple as “he” around the Prophet. I am just being sensible. That’s all it is. “A man is an oak, a
woman a willow,” the saying ran. The oak fought the wind and was broken, while the willow bent
when it must and survived. That did not mean she had to like bending. “He . . . the Lord Dragon . . . is
in Tear. The Lord Dragon has summoned me there.”
“Tear.” Masema took his hands away, and she surreptitiously rubbed her arms. She did not have
to try hiding it, though; he was staring at something beyond sight again. “Yes, I have heard.” Speaking
to something beyond sight, too, or to himself. “When Amadicia has come to the Lord Dragon as
Ghealdan has, I will lead the people to Tear, to bask in the radiance of the Lord Dragon. I will send
disciples to spread the word of the Lord Dragon throughout Tarabon and Arad Doman, to Saldaea and
Kandor and the Borderlands, to Andor, and I will lead the people to kneel at the Lord Dragon’s feet.”
“A wise plan . . . uh . . . O Prophet of the Lord Dragon.” A fool plan if she had ever heard one.
That was not to say it would not work. Fool plans often did, for some reason, when men made them.
Rand might even enjoy having all those people kneel to him, if he was half as arrogant as Egwene
claimed. “But we . . . I cannot wait. I have been summoned, and when the Lord Dragon summons,
mere mortals must obey.” Some day she was going to get a chance to box Rand’s head for her need to
do this! “I have to find a boat going downriver.”
Masema stared at her for so long that she began to grow nervous. Sweat trickled down her back,
and between her breasts, and it was only partly the heat. That stare would have made Moghedien
sweat.
Finally he nodded, fiery zealotry fading to leave only his usual dour scowl. “Yes,” he sighed. “If
you have been summoned, you must go. Go with the Light, and in the Light. Dress more appropriately
—those who have been close to the Lord Dragon must be virtuous above all others—and meditate on
the Lord Dragon and his Light.”
“A riverboat?” Nynaeve insisted. “You must know whenever a boat reaches Samara, or any
village along the river. If you could just tell me where I might find one, it would make my journey

much . . . swifter.” She had been going to say “easier,” but she did not think ease mattered much to
Masema.
“I do not concern myself with such things,” he said testily. “But you are right. When the Lord
Dragon commands, you must come on the hour. I will ask. If a vessel can be found, someone will tell
me of it eventually.” His eyes shifted to the other two men. “You must see that she is safe until then. If
she persists in clothing herself in this manner, she will attract men with vile thoughts. She must be
protected, like a wayward child, until she is reunited with the Lord Dragon.”
Nynaeve bit her tongue. A willow, not an oak, when a willow was needed. She managed to mask
her irritation behind a smile that had to carry all the gratitude the idiot man could wish. A dangerous
idiot, however. She had to remember that.
Uno and Ragan made their goodbyes quickly, with more forearm clasping, and hustled her out,
one on either arm, as if they thought it necessary to hurry her away from Masema for some reason.
Masema appeared to have forgotten them before they reached the door; he was already frowning at
the weedy man, waiting next to a bluff fellow in a farmer’s coat who was crumpling his cap in thick
hands, awe painted across his broad face.
She did not say a word as they retraced their steps through the kitchen, where the gray-haired
woman was sucking her teeth and stirring the soup as if she had not moved in the interval. Nynaeve
held her tongue while they retrieved their weapons, held it until they were out of the alleyway, into
something approaching the width of a street. Then she rounded on them, shaking her finger under each
nose alternately. “How dare you drag me out like that!” People passing by grinned—men ruefully,
women appreciatively—though none could have had an idea what she was berating them over.
“Another five minutes, and I would have had him finding a boat today! If you ever lay hands on me
again—!” Uno snorted so loudly that she cut off with a start.
“Another five bloody minutes, and Masema would have bloody well laid hands on you. Or
rather, he’d have said that someone should, and then someone flaming well would have! When he
says something should be done, there are always fifty flaming hands, or a hundred, or a flaming
thousand if need be, to do it!” He stalked off down the street, Ragan at his side, and she had to go
with them or be left. Uno paced on as if he knew she would trail after. She almost went the other way
just to prove him wrong. Following had nothing to do with fear of getting lost in that rabbit warren of
streets. She could have found her way out. Eventually. “He had a flaming Lord of the Crown High
Council flogged—flogged!—for half the heat in his voice that you had,” the one-eyed man growled.
“Contempt for the word of the Lord Dragon, he called it. Peace! Demanding what bloody right he had
to comment on your flaming clothes! For a few minutes you did well enough, but I saw your face there
at the end. You were ready to flaming lace into him again. The only thing worse you could have done
would be to bloody name the Lord Dragon. He calls that blasphemy. As well name the flaming Dark
One.”
Ragan’s topknot bobbed as he nodded. “Remember the Lady Baelome, Uno? Right after the first
rumors came from Tear naming the Lord Dragon, Nynaeve, she said something about ‘this Rand
al’Thor’ in Masema’s hearing, and he called for an axe and a chopping block without pause for
breath.”
“He had someone beheaded for that?” she said incredulously.
“No,” Uno muttered in disgust. “But only because she bloody well groveled when she realized
he flaming meant it. She was dragged out and hung up by her flaming wrists from the back of her own
coach, then strapped the bloody length of whatever village it was we were in then. Her own flaming
retainers stood like a bunch of sheep-gutted farmers and watched it.”

“When it was done,” Ragan added, “she thanked Masema for his mercy, the same as Lord
Aleshin did.” His tone had too much pointedness to suit her; he was delivering a moral, and intended
her to take it in. “They had reason, Nynaeve. Theirs would not have been the first heads he has put on
a stake. Yours could have been the latest. And ours with it, if we tried to give aid. Masema plays no
favorites.”
She drew breath. How could Masema have all this power? And not only among his own
followers, apparently. But then, there was no reason lords or ladies could be not as great fools as any
farmer; a good many were greater, in her estimation. That idiot woman with her rings had surely been
a lady; no merchant ever wore firedrops. Yet surely Ghealdan had laws and courts and judges. Where
was the queen, or the king? She could not remember which Ghealdan had. No one in the Two Rivers
had ever had much truck with kings or queens, yet that was what they were for, them and lords and
ladies, seeing justice fairly done. But whatever Masema did here was no concern of hers. She had
more important problems than worrying over a flock of imbeciles who let a madman trample them.
Still, curiosity made her say, “Does he mean that about trying to stop men and women looking at
one another? What does he think will happen if there are no marriages, no children? Will he stop
people farming next, or weaving or making shoes, so they can think about Rand al’Thor?” She
enunciated the name deliberately. These two went around calling him “the Lord Dragon” at the drop
of a pin almost as much as Masema did. “I will tell you this. If he tries telling women how to dress,
he will start a riot. Against him.” Samara must have something like a Women’s Circle—most places
did, even if they called it something else, even when it was not a formal arrangement at all; there
were some things men just did not have the sense to see to—and they surely could and did call
women down for wearing inappropriate clothes, but that was not the same as a man putting his finger
into it. Women did not meddle in men’s affairs—well, no more than was necessary—and men should
not meddle in women’s. “And I expect the men will react no better if he tries closing taverns and the
like. I never knew a man yet who wouldn’t cry himself to sleep if he could not put his nose in a mug
now and then.”
“Maybe he will,” Ragan said, “and maybe he won’t. Sometimes he orders things, and sometimes
he forgets, or puts it off anyway, because something more important comes along. You would be
surprised,” he added dryly, “at what his followers will accept from him without a whimper.” He and
Uno were flanking her, she realized, and watching the other folk in the street warily. Even to her, the
pair of them appeared ready to draw swords in a heartbeat. If they actually thought to carry out
Masema’s instructions, they had another think coming.
“He isn’t against bloody marriage,” Uno growled, staring so hard at a peddler with meat pies on
a tray that the man turned and ran without taking the coins from two women holding pies in their
hands. “You’re lucky he did not remember you have no husband, or he might have sent you to the Lord
Dragon with one. Sometimes he picks out three or four hundred unmarried men and as many women,
and flaming well marries them. Most have never seen each other before that day. If the pigeon-gutted
dirt-grubbers don’t bloody complain about that, do you think they’ll open their flaming mouths about
ale?”
Ragan muttered something under his breath, but she caught enough to narrow her eyes. “Some
man doesn’t know how bloody lucky he is.” That was what he had said. He did not even notice her
glare. He was too busy scanning the street, watching against someone who might try to abscond with
her like a pig in a sack. She was half tempted to take off the shawl and throw it away. He did not
seem to hear her sniff, either. Men could be insufferably blind and deaf when they wished to.
“At least he didn’t try to steal my jewelry,” she said. “Who was that fool woman who gave him

hers?” She could not have much sense if she had become one of Masema’s followers.
“That,” Uno said, “was Alliandre, Blessed of the Light, Queen of bloody Ghealdan. And a dozen
more titles, the way you southlanders like to pile them up.”
Nynaeve stubbed her toe on a cobblestone and almost fell. “So that is how he does it,” she
exclaimed, shaking off their helping hands. “If the queen is fool enough to listen to him, no wonder he
can do whatever he wants.”
“Not a fool,” Uno said sharply, flashing a frown at her before returning to watching the street.
“A wise woman. When you bloody find yourself straddling a wild horse, you bloody well ride it the
way it’s bloody going, if you’re smart enough to pour water out of a bloody boot. You think she’s a
fool because Masema took her rings? She’s flaming smart enough to know he might demand more if
she stopped wearing jewelry when she comes to him. The first time, he went to her—been the other
way round, since—and he did take the rings right off her flaming fingers. She had strands of pearls in
her hair, and he broke the strings pulling them out. All of her ladies-in-waiting were down on their
knees gathering the bloody things off the floor. Alliandre even picked up a few herself.”
“That doesn’t sound so wise to me,” she said stoutly. “It sounds like cowardice.” Whose knees
were shaking because he looked at her? a voice in her head asked. Who was sweating herself silly?
At least she had managed to face up to him. I did. Bending like a willow isn’t the same as cowering
like a mouse. “Is she the queen, or isn’t she?”
The two men exchanged those irritating looks, and Ragan said quietly, “You don’t understand,
Nynaeve. Alliandre is the fourth to sit on the Light Blessed Throne since we came to Ghealdan, and
that’s barely half a year. Johanin wore the crown when Masema began attracting a few crowds, but he
thought Masema a harmless madman and did nothing even when the crowds grew and his nobles told
him he had to put an end to it. Johanin died in a hunting accident—”
“Hunting accident!” Uno interjected, sneering. A hawker who happened to be looking at him
dropped his tray of pins and needles. “Not unless he didn’t know one bloody end of a flaming boar
spear from the other. Flaming southlanders and their flaming Game of Houses!”
“And Ellizelle succeeded,” Ragan took up. “She had the army dispersing the crowds, until
finally there was a pitched battle and it was the army that was chased off.”
“Bloody poor excuse for soldiers,” Uno muttered. She was going to have to speak to him about
his language again.
Ragan nodded agreement, but went on with what he had been saying. “They say Ellizelle took
poison after that, but however she died, she was replaced by Teresia, who lasted a full ten days after
her coronation, just until she had a chance to send two thousand soldiers against ten thousand folk
who had gathered to hear Masema outside Jehannah. After her soldiers were routed, she abdicated to
marry a rich merchant.” Nynaeve stared at him incredulously, and Uno snorted. “That is what they
say,” the younger man maintained. “Of course, in this land, marrying a commoner means giving up any
claim to the throne forever, and whatever Beron Goraed feels about having a pretty young wife with
royal blood, I hear he was dragged from his bed by a score of Alliandre’s retainers and hauled to
Jheda Palace for a wedding in the small hours of the morning. Teresia went off to live on her
husband’s new country estate while Alliandre was being crowned, all before sunrise, and the new
queen summoned Masema to the palace to tell him he would not be troubled again. Inside two weeks
she was calling on him. I do not know whether she really believes what he preaches, but I know she
took the throne of a land on the edge of civil war, with Whitecloaks ready to move in, and she
stopped it the only way she could. That is a wise queen, and a man could be proud to serve her, even
if she is a southlander.”

Nynaeve opened her mouth, and forgot what she was going to say when Uno said, in a casual
tone, “There’s a flaming Whitecloak following us. Don’t look around, woman. You have more bloody
sense than that.”
Her neck stiffened with the effort of keeping her eyes forward; prickles crawled up her back.
“Take the next turn, Uno.”
“That carries us away from the main streets, and the flaming gates. We can flaming lose him in
the crowds.”
“Take it!” She inhaled slowly, made her voice less shrill. “I need a sight of him.”
Uno glowered so fiercely that people stepped out of their way for ten paces ahead, but they
turned down the next narrow street. She shifted her head a trifle as they made the turn, just enough to
peek from the edge of her eye before the corner of a small stone tavern cut off her view. The snowy
cloak with the flaring sun stood out among the thin crowd. There was no mistaking that beautiful face,
the face she had been sure she would see. No other Whitecloak than Galad could have a reason to
follow her, and none to follow Uno or Ragan.

CHAPTER

The Wheel Weaves

As soon as the building hid Galad, Nynaeve’s eyes darted down the street ahead. Fury bubbled
up, at herself as much as Galadedrid Damodred. You witless woolhead! It was a narrow way like all
the rest, paved with rounded stones, lined with gray shops and houses and taverns, populated with a
scattered afternoon crowd. If you hadn’t come into town, he’d never have found you! Too scattered
to hide anyone. You had to go see the Prophet! You had to go believing the Prophet would whisk you
away before Moghedien gets here! When are you going to learn you can’t depend on anyone but
yourself? In an instant she made her choice. When Galad turned that corner and did not see them, he
would begin looking into shops, and maybe taverns as well.
“This way.” Gathering her skirts, she darted into the nearest alley and pressed her back against
the wall. No one glanced at her twice, furtive as she was, and what that had to say about the way
things were in Samara she did not want to consider. Uno and Ragan were beside her before she
finished setting her feet, crowding her farther down the dusty dirt alleyway, past an old splintered
bucket and a rain barrel dried to the point of collapse inside its hoops. At least they were doing what
she wanted. In a manner of speaking. Tense hands on long sword hilts rising above their shoulders,
they were ready to protect her whether she desired it or not. Let them, you fool! Do you think you
can protect yourself?
She was certainly angry enough. Galad, of all people! She should never have left the menagerie!
A fool whim, and one that might ruin everything. She could no more channel here than against
Masema. Just the possibility that Moghedien or Black sisters were in Samara made her dependent on
two men for her safety. It was enough to screw her anger tight; she could have chewed a hole in the
stone wall behind her. She knew why Aes Sedai had Warders—all but Reds, anyway. In her head,
she did. In her heart, it just made her want to snarl.
Galad appeared, threading his way slowly through the folk out in the street, eyes searching. By
all reason, he should have gone on by—he should have—yet almost immediately his gaze settled on
the alleyway. On them. He did not even have the grace to appear pleased or surprised.
Uno and Ragan moved together as Galad turned toward the alley. The one-eyed man had his
sword out in the blink of an eye, and Ragan was scarcely slower for all he paused to push her deeper
into the narrow passage. They positioned themselves one behind the other; should Galad make it past
Uno, he would still have Ragan to face.
Nynaeve ground her teeth. She could make all these swords unnecessary, useless; she could
sense the True Source, like a light unseen over her shoulder, waiting for her embrace. She could do it.
If she dared.
Galad stopped at the alley mouth, cloak thrown back, one hand resting nonchalantly on his sword

hilt, a picture of spring-steel grace. Except for his burnished mail, he could have been at a ball.
“I do not want to kill either of you, Shienaran,” he said calmly to Uno. Nynaeve had heard
Elayne and Gawyn speak of Galad’s sword skill, but for the first time she realized that he might really
be as good as they said. At least, he thought he was. Two seasoned soldiers with blades bare, and he
eyed them as a wolfhound would eye a pair of lesser dogs, not seeking a fight yet utterly confident he
could take both. Never quite looking away from the two men, he addressed her. “Someone else might
have run into a shop or an inn, but you never do what is expected. Will you let me speak with you?
There is no need to make me kill these men.”
None of the passersby were stopping, but even with three men blocking her view she could see
heads swiveling for a glimpse of what had drawn the Whitecloak. And plainly taking in the swords.
Rumors would be hatching in all those minds and taking flight on wings that made duskswallows
seem slow.
“Let him by,” she commanded. When Uno and Ragan did not budge, she repeated herself, even
more firmly. They did move aside then, slowly, as much as the narrow alley would allow, yet though
neither said a word, there was an air of muttering about them. Galad came by smoothly, seeming to
forget the Shienarans. She suspected that believing so would be a mistake; the top-knotted men plainly
did not.
Aside from one of the Forsaken, she could not imagine a man she would less like to see right
then, but with that face in front of her, she was all too conscious of her own breathing, her own
heartbeat. It was ludicrous. Why could the man not be ugly? Or at least plain.
“You knew I knew that you were following.” Accusation rang strongly in her voice, though she
was not sure what she was accusing him of. Not doing what she had expected and wanted, she
imagined ruefully.
“I assumed as much as soon as I recognized you, Nynaeve. I remember that you generally see
more than you let on.”
She would not let him divert her with compliments. Look where that had gotten her with Valan
Luca. “What are you doing in Ghealdan? I thought you were on your way to Altara.”
For a moment he stared down at her with those dark, beautiful eyes, then abruptly laughed. “In
all the world, Nynaeve, only you would ask me the question I should be asking you. Very well. I’ll
answer you, for all it should be the other way round. I did have orders for Salidar, in Altara, but all
changed when this Prophet fellow—What is the matter? Are you unwell?”
Nyaneve forced her face to smoothness. “Of course not,” she said irritably. “My health is quite
good, thank you very kindly.” Salidar! Of course! The name was like one of Aludra’s firesticks going
off in her head. All of that racking of her brain, and Galad casually handed her what she had been
unable to dig up on her own. Now if only Masema found a ship quickly. If only she could make sure
Galad would not betray them. Without letting Uno and Ragan kill him, of course. Whatever Elayne
said, Nynaeve could not believe she would appreciate having her brother cut down. Small chance he
would believe Elayne was not with her. “I just cannot get over my shock at seeing you.”
“A small patch on mine, when I learned you had slipped out of Sienda.” Sternness became that
handsome face to an unfortunate degree, but his tone offset it. Somewhat. He could have been
lecturing a small girl who had sneaked out of the house after her bedtime to climb trees. “I was sick
near to death with worry. What under the Light possessed you? Have you any idea of the risks you
ran? And to come here, of all places. Elayne always chooses to saddle a horse at the gallop if she
can, but I thought that you, at least, had more sense. This so-called Prophet—” He cut off, eyeing the
other two men. Uno had grounded his swordpoint, scarred hands folded atop the pommel. Ragan

appeared to be inspecting his blade’s edge to the exclusion of everything else.
“I have heard rumors,” Galad went on slowly, “that he is Shienaran. You cannot have been
witless enough to get yourself mixed up with him.” There was too much question in that for her taste
by far.
“Neither of them is the Prophet, Galad,” she said wryly. “I’ve known them both for some little
time, and I can assure you of that. Uno, Ragan, unless you intend to prune your toenails, put those
things up. Well?” They hesitated before doing as they were told, Uno grumping under his breath and
glaring, but they did it finally. Men usually responded to a firm voice. Most did. Sometimes, anyway.
“I hardly thought they were, Nynaeve.” Galad’s tone, even more arid than hers, made her bristle,
but when he went on, he sounded annoyed rather than superior. And worried. Which made her bristle
even more, of course. He all but gave her palpitations, and he had the nerve to be worried. “I do not
know what you and Elayne have fallen into here, and I do not care, so long as I can extract you from it
before you are hurt. Trade is slow on the river, but a suitable boat of some sort should call in the next
few days. Let me know where I can find you, and I will secure you passage to somewhere in Altara.
From there, you can make your way to Caemlyn.”
She gaped in spite of herself. “You mean to find us a ship?”
“It is all I can do, now.” He sounded apologetic, and shook his head as if arguing with himself.
“I cannot escort you to safety; my duty is here.”
“We wouldn’t want to take you from your duty,” she said, a touch breathless. If he wanted to
misunderstand, let him. The most she had hoped for was that he would leave them be.
He seemed to feel the need to defend himself. “It is hardly safe to send you off alone, but a boat
will take you away before the entire border explodes. Which it will, soon or late; all it needs is one
spark, and the Prophet is sure to strike it if no one else does. You must see to getting yourselves to
Caemlyn, you and Elayne. All I ask is your promise that you will go there. The Tower is no place for
either of you. Or for—” He clamped his teeth shut, but he might as well have gone ahead and named
Egwene.
It could not hurt, having Galad looking for a boat, too. If Masema could forget whether he
intended to close the taverns, he could forget to have anyone find a riverboat. Especially if he thought
a convenient bout of forgetfulness might keep her there to further his own plans. It could not hurt—if
she could trust Galad. If she could not, then she would have to hope he was not as good with that
sword as he thought he was. A stark thought, but not so stark as what might happen—would happen—
if he proved untrustworthy.
“I am what I am, Galad, and Elayne is the same.” Dodging around Masema had put a bad taste on
her tongue. A little White Tower sidestepping was as close as she could come. “And you are what
you are, now.” She raised her eyebrows significantly at his white cloak. “That lot hates the Tower,
and they hate women who can channel. Now that you are one of them, why shouldn’t I think there will
be fifty of you after me inside the hour, trying to put an arrow in my back if they can’t haul me off to a
cell? Me, and Elayne as well.”
Galad’s head jerked in irritation. Or maybe he was offended. “How often must I tell you? I
would never let harm come to my sister. Or to you.”
It truly was annoying, realizing that she was annoyed at the pause that made it clear she was an
afterthought. She was not some silly girl, to lose her wits because a man had eyes that somehow
managed to be melting and incredibly penetrating at the same time. “If you say it so,” she told him,
and his head tossed again.
“Tell me where you are put up, and I will bring word, or send it, as soon as I locate a suitable

vessel.”
If Elayne was right, he could no more lie than could an Aes Sedai who had sworn the Three
Oaths, but still she hesitated. A mistake here could be her last. She had a right to take risks for
herself, but this risk involved Elayne, too. And Thom and Juilin, for that matter; they were her
responsibility, whatever they wanted to think. But she was here, and the decision had to be hers. Not
that it might be any other way, frankly.
“Light, woman, what more do you want of me?” Galad growled, half-raising his hands as though
to grab her shoulders. Uno’s blade was between them in a flash of bright steel, but Elayne’s brother
actually brushed it aside like a twig, and paid it no more mind than one. “I mean no harm to you, now
or ever; I swear it by my mother’s name. You say that you are what you are? I know what you are.
And what you are not. Perhaps half the reason I wear this,” he touched an edge of his snowy cloak,
“is because the Tower sent you out—you and Elayne and Egwene—for the Light knows what reason,
when you are what you are. It was like sending a boy who has just learned to hold a sword into battle,
and I will never forgive them. There is still time for both of you to turn aside; you do not have to carry
that sword. The Tower is too dangerous for you or my sister, especially now. Half the world is
become too dangerous for you! Let me help you to safety.” The tightness slid from his voice, though it
took on a raw edge. “I beg you, Nynaeve. If anything happened to Elayne . . . I half-wish that Egwene
were with you, so I could . . .” Scrubbing a hand through his hair, he looked left and right, searching
for how to convince her. Uno and Ragan held their blades ready to drive through his body, but he did
not appear to see them. “In the name of the Light, Nynaeve, please allow me to do what I can.”
It was a simple thing that finally tipped the balance in her mind. They were in Ghealdan.
Amadicia was the only land that actually made a crime out of a woman being able to channel, and
they were on the opposite bank of the river. That left only Galad’s oaths as a Child of the Light to
battle against his duty to Elayne. She gave blood the edge in that struggle. Besides, he really was too
gorgeous for her to let Uno and Ragan kill him. Not that that had anything to do with her decision, of
course.
“We are with Valan Luca’s show,” she said at last.
He blinked at her, frowned. “Valan Luca’s . . . ? You mean one of the menageries?” Incredulity
and disgust fought in his voice. “What under the Light are you doing in company like that? Those who
keep such shows are no better than . . . No matter. If you need coin, I can supply some. Enough to see
you in a decent inn.”
His tone bespoke his certainty that she would do as he wanted. Not a “can I help you with a few
crowns?” or a “would you like me to find a room for you?” He thought they should be in an inn, so
into an inn they would go. The man might have observed enough to know she would duck into an
alley, but he did not know her at all, it seemed. Besides, there were reasons to stay with Luca.
“Do you think there is a room, or a hayloft, not taken in all of Samara?” she asked, a touch more
tartly than intended.
“I am certain I can find—”
She cut him off. “The last place anyone would look for us is among the shows.” The last place
anyone but Moghedien would look, at least. “You’ll agree we should keep from sight as much as
possible? If you did find a room, more than likely you’d have to have someone put out of it. A Child
of the Light securing a room so for two women? That would set tongues wagging and draw eyes like
flies to a midden.”
He did not like it, grimacing, and glaring at Uno and Ragan as if it were their fault, but he had
enough sense to see sense. “It is no fit place for either of you, but it is probably safer than anywhere

inside the city at that. Since you have at least agreed to go to Caemlyn, I will say no more on it.”
She kept her face smooth and let him think as he wished. If he thought she had promised what she
had not, that was his affair. She had to keep him away from the show as much as possible, though.
One glimpse of his sister in those spangled white breeches, and the uproar would overshadow any
riot Masema could raise. “You will have to stay clear of the menagerie, mind. Until you find a ship,
anyway. Then come to the performers’ wagons at nightfall and ask for Nana.” He liked that even less,
if possible, but she forestalled him firmly. “I’ve not seen a single Child of the Light near any of the
shows. If you visit one, don’t you think people will notice and ask why?”
His smile was still gorgeous, but it showed too many teeth. “You have an answer for everything,
it seems. Do you have any objection to my escorting you back there, at least?”
“I most certainly do. There will be rumors as it is—a hundred people must have noticed us
talking here”—she could no longer see the street past the three men, yet she had no doubt passersby
were still glancing into the alley, and Uno and Ragan had not resheathed their swords—“but if you
accompany me, we’ll be seen by ten times as many.”
His wince was half rueful, half mirthful. “An answer for everything,” he muttered. “But you have
the right of it.” Clearly he wished she did not. “Hear me, Shienarans,” he said, turning his head, and
suddenly his voice was steel. “I am Galadedrid Damodred, and this woman is under my protection.
As for her companion, I would count it small loss to die in order to save her the smallest harm. If you
allow either to come to that smallest harm, I will find you both and kill you.” Ignoring the sudden,
dangerous blankness of their faces as completely as he did their swords, he swung his eyes back to
her. “I suppose you still will not tell me where Egwene is?”
“All you need know is that she is far from here.” Folding her arms beneath her breasts, she could
feel her heart beating through her ribs. Was she making a dangerous mistake because of a pretty face?
“And safer than any action of yours can make her.”
He looked as if he did not believe her, but he made no more of it. “With luck, I will find a vessel
in a day or two. Until then, stay close to this Valan Luca’s . . . show. Stay low and avoid notice. As
much as you can with your hair that color. And tell Elayne not to run away from me again. The Light
shone on you to let me find you still in one piece, and it will have to shine twice as brightly to keep
you from harm if you try haring off across Ghealdan. This Prophet’s blasphemous ruffians are
everywhere, without respect for law or persons, and that does not count brigands taking advantage of
disorder. Samara itself is a wasp nest, but if you will sit quietly—and convince my headstrong sister
to do the same—I will find a way to get you out of it before you are stung.”
It was an effort to keep her mouth shut. Taking what she told him and making it an injunction to
her! Next thing the man would want to pack her and Elayne in wool and sit them on a shelf! Wouldn’t
it be best if someone did? a tiny voice asked. Haven’t you caused enough trouble going your own
way? She told the voice to be quiet. It did not listen, but began listing disasters and near disasters
sprung from her own stubbornness.
Apparently taking her silence for acquiescence, he turned away from her—and stopped. Ragan
and Uno had moved to block his way to the street, glancing at her with that strange, deceptive calm
men so often adopted when they were a hairsbreadth from sudden violence. The air seemed to
crackle, until she motioned hurriedly. The Shienarans lowered their blades and stood aside, and
Galad took his hands from his sword, brushed past them and melded into the crowd without a
backward glance.
Nynaeve gave Uno and Ragan each a good glare before stalking off in the opposite direction.
There she had had everything arranged properly, and they had to nearly ruin it all. Men always

seemed to think violence could solve anything. If she had had a stout stick, she would have thumped
all three of them about the shoulders until they saw reason.
The Shienarans seemed to see a little of it, now; they caught up to her, swords scabbarded on
their backs once more, and followed without a word, even when she twice took a wrong turn and had
to double back. It was especially well for them that they kept silent then. She had had enough of
holding her tongue. First Masema, and then Galad. All she wanted was a wafer-thin excuse to tell
someone exactly what she thought. Especially that little voice in her head, pushed back to an insect
buzz now but refusing to be quiet.
By the time they were out of Samara and on that dirt cart track, with its sparse traffic, the voice
refused to be denied. She worried over Rand’s arrogance, but hers had brought herself and others as
near calamity as made no never mind. For Birgitte, perhaps it was well over the line, even if she was
alive. The best thing was for Nynaeve not to confront them again, not the Black Ajah and not
Moghedien, not until someone who knew what they were doing could decide what should be done.
Protest welled up, but she stamped on it as firmly as she ever had on Thom or Juilin. She would go to
Salidar and hand the matter over to the Blues. That was how it would be. She was set on it.
“Have you eaten something that disagrees with you?” Ragan said. “Your mouth is twisted as if
you had chewed a ripe duckberry.”
She gave him a look that snapped his teeth shut and stalked on. The two Shienarans kept pace to
either side.
What was she going to do with them? That she should put them to some use was never in doubt;
their appearance was too providential to throw away. For one thing, two additional pairs of eyes—
Well, three eyes anyway; she was going to learn to look at that patch without swallowing if it killed
her—more eyes hunting for a ship might mean finding one sooner. All very well if Masema or Galad
found a vessel first, but she did not want either to know more of her doings than she had to allow.
There was no telling what either might do.
“Are you following me because Masema told you to look after me,” she demanded, “or because
Galad did?”
“What flaming difference does it make?” Uno muttered. “If the Lord Dragon has summoned you,
you bloody well—” He cut off, frowning, as she raised one finger. Ragan eyed it as if it were a
weapon.
“Do you mean to help Elayne and me reach Rand?”
“We’ve nothing better to do,” Ragan said dryly. “As it is, we’ll not see Shienar again till we are
gray and toothless. We might as well ride with you to Tear or wherever he is.”
She had not considered that, but it made sense. Two more to help Thom and Juilin with chores
and standing guard. No need to let them know how long that might take, or how many stops and
detours could lie along the way. The Blues in Salidar might not let any of them go further. Once they
reached Aes Sedai, they would be only Accepted again. Stop thinking about it! You are going to do
it!
The crowd waiting in front of Luca’s garish sign appeared no smaller than it had before. A
stream of people trickled into the meadow to join the throng as another stream meandered out,
exclaiming over what they had seen. Now and again the “boar-horses” were visible, rearing above
the canvas wall, to oohs and aahs from those waiting to get in. Cerandin was putting them through
their paces again. The Seanchan woman always saw that the s’redit got plenty of rest. She was very
firm about that, whatever Luca wanted. Men did do as they were told when you left no doubt that
anything else was inconceivable. Usually they did.

Short of the well-trampled brown grass, Nynaeve stopped and turned to face the two Shienarans.
She kept her face calm, but they looked suitably wary, though in Uno’s case, regrettably, that involved
fiddling with his eyepatch in a queasy-making way. The folk heading to or from the show paid no
heed to them.
“Then it will not be because of Masema or Galad,” she said firmly. “If you are going to travel
with me, you will do as I say, else you can go your own way, for I’ll have none of you.”
Of course they had to exchange glances before nodding acceptance. “If that’s how it flaming has
to be,” Uno growled, “then well enough. If you don’t have somebody to bloody well look after you,
you’ll never flaming live to reach the Lord Dragon. Some sheep-gutted farmer will have you for
breakfast because of your tongue.” Ragan gave him a guarded look that said he agreed with every
word but strongly doubted Uno’s wisdom in voicing them. Ragan, it seemed, had the makings of a
wise man in him.
If they accepted her terms, it did not really matter why. For now. There would be plenty of time
later to set them straight.
“I don’t doubt the others will agree, too,” Ragan said.
“Others?” she said, blinking. “You mean there are more than the two of you? How many?”
“There are only fifteen of us altogether now. I don’t think Bartu or Nengar will come.”
“Sniffing after the bloody Prophet.” Uno turned his head and spat copiously. “Only fifteen. Sar
went over that bloody cliff in the mountains, and Mendao had to get himself into a flaming duel with
three Hunters for the Horn, and . . .”
Nynaeve was too busy stopping herself from gaping to listen. Fifteen! She could not help toting
up in her head what it would cost to feed fifteen men. Even when they were not particularly hungry,
Thom or Juilin, either one, ate more than Elayne and her combined. Light!
On the other hand, with fifteen Shienaran soldiers, there was no need to wait for a ship. A
riverboat was certainly the fastest way to travel—she remembered what she had heard of Salidar,
now; a river town, or close by; a boat could take them right to it—yet a Shienaran escort would make
their wagon just as safe, from Whitecloaks or bandits or followers of the Prophet. But much slower.
And a lone wagon heading away from Samara with such an escort would certainly stand out. A
signpost for Moghedien, or the Black Ajah. I will let the Blues deal with them, and that is that!
“What is wrong?” Ragan asked, and Uno added apologetically, “I shouldn’t have mentioned how
Sakaru died.” Sakaru? That must have been after she stopped listening. “I don’t spend much time
around fla—, around ladies. I forget you have weak bell—, I mean, uh, delicate stomachs.” If he did
not stop tugging at that eyepatch, he was going to find out how delicate her stomach was.
The number changed nothing. If two Shienarans were good, fifteen were wonderful. Her own
private army. No need to worry about Whitecloaks or brigands or riots, or whether she had made a
mistake about Galad. How many hams could fifteen men eat every day? A firm voice. “Right, then.
Every night just after dark, one of you—one, mind!—will come here and ask for Nana. That’s the
name I am known by.” She had no reason for the order, except to put them in the habit of doing what
she told them. “Elayne goes by Morelin, but you ask for Nana. If you need coin, come to me, not
Masema.” She had to suppress a wince as the words left her mouth. There was still gold in the
wagon’s stove, but Luca had not demanded his hundred gold crowns yet, and he would. There was
always the jewelry, if need be, though. She had to be sure they were weaned away from Masema.
“Aside from that, none of you are to come near me, or the show.” Without that, they would likely set a
guard, or some such idiocy. “Not unless a riverboat arrives. In that case, you come running on the
instant. Do you understand me?”

“No,” Uno muttered. “Why do we flaming have to keep away—?” His head jerked back as her
admonitory finger almost touched his nose.
“Do you remember what I said about your language?” She had to make herself give him a level
look; that glaring red eyepatch made her stomach do flips. “Unless you do remember, you will learn
why men in the Two Rivers have decent tongues in their mouths.”
She watched him turn that over in his mind. He did not know what her connection with the White
Tower was, only that it existed. She might be an agent of the Tower, or Tower-trained. Or even Aes
Sedai, though one not long to the shawl. And the threat was vague enough for him to put his own worst
interpretation to it. She had known that technique long before hearing Juilin mention it to Elayne.
When it appeared the idea had taken hold—and before he could ask any questions—she lowered
her hand. “You will stay away for the same reason Galad does. So as not to draw attention. For the
rest, you will do it because I say so. If I must explain my every decision to you, I’ll have time for
nothing else, so you must make the best of it.”
That was a suitably Aes Sedai comment. Besides, they had no choice if they intended to help her
reach Rand, as they thought, which meant they had no choice. All in all, she was feeling quite
satisfied with herself as she shooed them off back toward Samara and strode past the waiting crowd
and under the sign bearing Valan Luca’s name.
To her surprise, there was an addition to the show. On a new platform not far from the entry, a
woman in gauzy yellow trousers was standing on her head, arms outstretched to either side with a
pair of white doves on each hand. No, not on her head. The woman was gripping some sort of
wooden frame in her teeth and balancing on that. As Nynaeve watched, aghast, the peculiar acrobat
lowered her hands to the platform for a moment while bending herself double, until she seemed to be
sitting on her own head. Even that was not enough. Her legs curved down in front of her, then
impossibly back up under her arms, whereupon she transferred the doves to the upturned soles of her
feet, now the highest part of the contorted ball she had knotted herself into. The onlookers gasped and
applauded, but the sight made Nynaeve shiver. It was all too good a reminder of what Moghedien had
done to her.
That isn’t why I mean to hand her over to the Blues, she told herself. I just do not want to
cause calamity again. That was true, but she was also afraid that the next time, she would not escape
so easily or so lightly. She would not have admitted that to another soul. She did not like admitting it
to herself.
Giving the contortionist one last puzzled glance—she could not begin to puzzle out what the
woman had twisted herself into now—she turned away. And started as Elayne and Birgitte suddenly
appeared at her side out of the milling crowd. Elayne had a cloak decently covering her white coat
and breeches; Birgitte was all but flaunting her low-necked red gown. No, there was no “all but” to it.
She stood even straighter than usual and had tossed back her braid to remove even its minimal
covering. Nynaeve fingered the knot of her shawl at her waist, wishing every glance at Birgitte did
not remind her how much she herself would be showing once the gray wool came off. The other
woman’s quiver hung at her belt, and she carried the bow Luca had found for her. Surely the day was
too late for her to go through with the shooting.
A glance at the sky told Nynaeve she was wrong. Despite everything that had happened, the sun
still stood well above the horizon. Shadows stretched long, but not long enough to dissuade Birgitte,
she suspected.
In an attempt to cover checking the sun, she nodded toward the woman in the gauzy trousers, who
had now begun to twist herself into something that Nynaeve knew was impossible. While still

balancing on her teeth. “Where did she come from?”
“Luca hired her,” Birgitte answered calmly. “He bought some leopards, as well. Her name is
Muelin.”
If Birgitte was all self-possessed coolness, Elayne very nearly quivered with emotion. “’Where
did she come from?’ ” she spluttered. “She came from a show that a mob nearly destroyed!”
“I heard about that,” Nynaeve said, “but that isn’t what is important. I—”
“Not important!” Elayne rolled her eyes to the heavens as if for guidance. “Did you also hear
why? I don’t know whether it was Whitecloaks or this Prophet, but somebody whipped up that mob
because they thought . . .” She glanced around without slowing and lowered her voice; none of the
crowd had stopped, but every passerby stared at two obvious performers standing. “. . . that a woman
in the show might wear a shawl.” She emphasized the last word significantly. “Fools to think she’d be
with a traveling menagerie, but then, you and I are. And you go dashing into the city without a word to
anyone. We’ve heard everything from a bald-headed man carrying you off over his shoulder to you
kissing a Shienaran and traipsing away with him arm in arm.”
Nynaeve was still gaping when Birgitte added, “Luca was upset, whatever the tale. He said . . .”
She cleared her throat and made her voice deep. “ ‘So she likes rough men, does she? Well, I can be
as rough as a winter cob!’ And off he set, leading two lads with shoulders like s’Gandin quarrynien,
to fetch you back. Thom Merrilin and Juilin Sandar went as well, in not much better temper. That did
not improve Luca’s, but they were all so upset over you it left no room for anger at each other.”
For a moment Nynaeve stared in confusion. She liked rough men? What could he possibly mean
by . . . ? Slowly it sank in, and she groaned. “Oh, that is just what I need.” And Thom and Juilin
running around Samara. The Light knew what trouble they could get into.
“I still want to know what you thought you were doing,” Elayne said, “but we are wasting time
here.”
Nynaeve let them start her off through the crowd, one to either side, but even with the news of
Luca and the others, she felt satisfied with her day’s work. “We should be out of here in a day or two,
with luck. If Galad doesn’t find us a boat, Masema will. It turns out he is the Prophet. You remember
Masema, Elayne. That sour-faced Shienaran we saw—” Realizing that Elayne had stopped, Nynaeve
paused for her to catch up again.
“Galad?” the younger woman said disbelievingly, forgetting to hold her cloak closed. “You saw
—you spoke to Galad? And the Prophet? You must have, or how would they be trying to find a
vessel? Did you have tea with them, or did you just meet them in a common room? Where the baldheaded man carried you, no doubt. Maybe the King of Ghealdan was there, too? Would you please
convince me I am dreaming so I can wake up?”
“Get a grip on yourself,” Nynaeve said firmly. “It is a queen, now, not a king, and yes, she was.
And he wasn’t bald; he had a topknot. The Shienaran, I mean. Not the Prophet.He’s as bald as—”
She glared at Birgitte until the woman stopped snickering. The glower slipped a little when Nynaeve
remembered who she was glowering at and what she had done to her, but if the woman had not
smoothed her features, they might have found out whether she could bring herself to slap Birgitte
cross-eyed. They began walking again, and she said as levelly as she could manage, “This is what
happened. I saw Uno, one of the Shienarans who was at Falme, watching you highwalk, Elayne. He
doesn’t think any better of the Daughter-Heir of Andor showing her legs than I do, by the way. In any
case, Moiraine sent them here after Falme, but . . .”
She related everything quickly as they made their way through the crowd, riding roughshod over
Elayne’s increasingly incredulous exclamations, answering their questions in as few words as

possible. Despite a quick interest in the shifts of the Ghealdanin throne, Elayne concentrated on
exactly what Galad had said and why Nynaeve had been fool enough to approach the Prophet,
whoever he was. That word—fool—popped up often enough to make Nynaeve keep a tight leash on
her temper. She might doubt whether she could slap Birgitte, but Elayne had no such protection,
Daughter-Heir or not. A few more repetitions, and the girl would discover it. Birgitte was more
interested in Masema’s intentions on the one hand and the Shienarans on the other. It seemed she had
encountered Borderlanders in previous lives, though their nations had had different names, and
thought well of them by and large. She said little, really, but she appeared to approve of holding on to
the Shienarans.
Nynaeve expected the news about Salidar to startle them, or excite them, or anything but what it
did. Birgitte took it as matter-of-factly as if she had said they would eat supper with Thom and Juilin
that night. Plainly she meant to go where Elayne did, and all else mattered little. Elayne looked
doubtful. Doubtful!
“Are you certain? You have tried so hard to remember, and . . . Well, it seems awfully fortuitous
that Galad should just happen to mention it to you.”
Nynaeve glowered. “Of course I am certain. Coincidences do happen. The Wheel weaves as the
Wheel wills, as you may have heard. I remember now that he mentioned it in Sienda, too, but I was so
concerned over you being concerned about him that I didn’t—” She cut off short.
They had arrived at a long narrow area near the north wall, marked off by ropes. At one end
stood something like a segment of wooden fence, two paces wide and two tall. People lined the ropes
four deep, with children crouching down in front or holding a father’s leg or a mother’s skirts. A buzz
rose as the three women appeared. Nynaeve would have stopped dead, but Birgitte had her by the
arm, and it was walk or be dragged.
“I thought we were going to the wagon,” she said faintly. Busy with talking, she had paid too
little attention to where they were going.
“Not unless you want to see me shoot in the dark,” Birgitte replied. She sounded all too willing
to give it a try.
Nynaeve wished she could have made some other comment than a squeak. The bit of fence filled
her vision as they progressed down the open space, to the exclusion of the onlookers. Even their
increasing murmurs sounded distant. The fence looked a mile from where Birgitte would stand.
“Are you sure that he said he swore by . . . our mother?” Elayne demanded sourly.
Acknowledging Galad as her brother even that far was unpleasant for her.
“What? Yes. I said so, didn’t I? Listen. If Luca is in the city, he would not know whether we did
this or not until it was too late to . . .” Nynaeve knew she was babbling, but she could not seem to
stop her tongue. Somehow she had never realized how far a hundred paces really was. In the Two
Rivers, grown men always shot targets at twice that. But then, none of those targets had ever been her.
“I mean, it already is very late. The shadows . . . The glare . . . We really should do this in the
morning. When the light is—”
“If he swore by her,” Elayne broke in as if she had not been listening, “then he will hold to it no
matter what. He would sooner break an oath on his hope of salvation and rebirth than that. I think . . .
no, I know we can trust him.” She did not sound as if she particularly liked it, though.
“The light is just fine,” Birgitte said, a hint of amusement in her calm voice. “I might try it
blindfolded. This lot will want it to look difficult, I think.”
Nynaeve opened her mouth, but nothing came out. This time she would have settled for a squeak.
Birgitte was only making a bad joke. She had to be joking.

They positioned her with her back against the rough wooden fence, and Elayne began tugging at
the knot in the shawl as Birgitte turned back the way they had come, drawing an arrow from her
quiver.
“You really did something foolish this time,” Elayne muttered. “We can trust Galad’s oath, I’m
sure, but you could not know what he might do beforehand. And to approach the Prophet!” She jerked
the shawl from Nynaeve’s shoulders roughly. “You could have had no idea whatsoever what he might
do. You worried everybody and risked everything!”
“I know,” Nynaeve managed to get out. The sun was in her eyes; she could no longer see Birgitte
at all. But Birgitte could see her. Of course she could. That was the important thing.
Elayne looked at her suspiciously. “You know?”
“I know I risked everything. I should have talked with you, asked you. I know I’ve been a fool. I
should not be allowed outside without a keeper.” It all came in a breathless rush. Birgitte must be
able to see her.
Suspicion became concern. “Are you all right? If you really do not want to do this . . .”
The woman thought she was afraid. Nynaeve could not, would not, allow that. She forced a
smile, hoped her eyes were not too wide. Her face felt tight. “Of course I want to. I’m looking
forward to it, actually.”
Elayne gave her a dubious frown, but nodded at last. “You are sure about Salidar?”
She did not wait for an answer, but hurried off to one side, folding the shawl. For some reason,
Nynaeve could not work up a proper indignation over the question, or Elayne not waiting. Her breath
was coming so fast that she was dimly aware that she might come right out of the dress’s low neck,
yet even that thought could not catch her. The sun filled her view; had she squinted, she might have
been able to make out Birgitte after a fashion, but her eyes had a will of their own, increasingly
widening. There was nothing she could do now. It was a punishment for taking foolish risks. She
could manage only the tiniest pique over being punished after working everything out so well. And
Elayne did not even believe her about Salidar! She would have to take it stoically. She would—
Seemingly out of nowhere an arrow tchunked into the wood, vibrating against her right wrist,
and stoic resolve broke with a low wail. It was all she could do to keep her knees straight. A second
arrow brushed the other wrist, producing a slightly higher pitch to her yelp. She could as soon stop
Birgitte’s shafts as silence herself. Arrow by arrow the yelps rose higher, and it seemed to her almost
as if the crowd was cheering her cries. The louder she shrieked, the louder they cheered and
applauded. By the time she was outlined from knees to head, the applause was thunderous. In truth,
she felt some irritation at the finish, when the crowd all rushed to throng around Birgitte, leaving her
standing there staring at the fletchings around her. Some still quivered. She still quivered.
Pushing away, she scurried off toward the wagons as quickly as she could before anyone noticed
how much her legs were wobbling. Not that anyone was paying any attention to her. All she had done
was stand there and pray Birgitte did not sneeze, or get an itch. And tomorrow she would have to go
through it again. That or let Elayne—and worse, Birgitte—know she could not face it.
When Uno came that night asking after Nana, she told him in no uncertain terms to prod Masema
as much as he dared and to find Galad and tell him he must find a boat quickly, whatever it required.
Then she took to her bed without eating and tried to make herself believe that she could convince
Elayne and Birgitte that she was too ill to stand against that wall. Only, she was all too certain they
would know exactly what her illness was. That even Birgitte would likely be all sympathy just made
it worse. One of those fool men had to find a riverboat!

CHAPTER
41

The Craft of Kin Tovere

One hand on his sword hilt, the other holding the green-and-white tasseled length of Seanchan
spear, Rand ignored the others on the sparsely treed hilltop for the moment while he studied the three
camps spread out below in the midmorning sun. Three distinct camps, and that was the rub. They
were all the Cairhienin and Tairen forces at his disposal. Every man else who could use sword or
spear was penned in the city, or the Light alone knew where.
The Aiel had rounded up refugees in hordes between the Jangai Pass and here, and a few had
even straggled in on their own, lured by rumors that these Aiel at least were not killing everyone in
sight, or else too dispirited to care so long as they had a meal before dying. Too many thought they
would die, at the hands of the Aiel or the Dragon Reborn, or in the Last Battle, which they seemed to
think was shaping up for any day now. A goodly number all together, but farmers and craftsmen and
shopkeepers for the most part. Some knew how to use bow or sling to fetch a rabbit, but there was not
a soldier in the lot and no time to teach them. The city of Cairhien itself lay little more than five miles
to the west, some of the fabled “topless towers of Cairhien” visible above the intervening forest. The
city sprawled across hills hard by the River Alguenya, encircled by Couladin’s Shaido and those who
had joined him.
One haphazard set of tents and cookfires in the long shallow valley below Rand held some eight
hundred Tairens, armored men. Nearly half were Defenders of the Stone in burnished breastplates
and rimmed helmets, their plump coatsleeves striped black and gold. The rest were levies from a
double handful of lords whose banners and pennants made a circle in the camp’s center around the
silver Crescent-and-Stars of the High Lord Weiramon. Guards stood thickly along their picket lines
as if they expected a raid against the horses any minute.
Three hundred paces away, the second camp guarded their horses as tightly. The animals were a
mixed lot, few approaching the fine arch-necked stock of Tear, and some former plow and cart horses
were tied along those ropes or Rand missed his guess. The Cairhienin numbered perhaps a hundred
more than the Tairens, but their tents were fewer and most often patched, and their banners and con
represented some seventy-odd lords. Few Cairhienin nobles still had many retainers, and the army
had broken apart early in the civil war.
The last gathering lay another five hundred paces along, full of Cairhienin for the most part, yet
well and truly separated from the others by more than distance. Larger than the other pair combined,
this camp held few tents or horses. It displayed no banners, and only the officers wore con, the small
pennants on their backs in solid colors meant to pick them out for their men rather than signify a
House. Infantry might be necessary, but rare was the lord of Tear or Cairhien, either one, who would
admit it. Certainly none would agree to actually lead such. It was the most orderly of the camps,

though, the cookfires in neat rows, the long pikes stacked upright where they could be seized in a
moment and clusters of archers or crossbowmen dotted along the lines. According to Lan, discipline
kept men alive in battle, but infantry were more likely to know it and believe than cavalry.
The three groups were supposedly together, under the same command—the High Lord Weiramon
had brought them in from the south late the day before—but the two camps of horsemen watched each
other nearly as warily as they did the Aiel on the surrounding hills, the Tairens with a dose of
contempt that the Cairhienin echoed in ignoring the third, which in turn eyed the others sullenly.
Rand’s followers, his allies, and as ready to fight each other as anyone else.
Still pretending to study the camps, Rand examined Weiramon, helmetless and iron-spined
straight nearby. Two younger men, minor Tairen lords, hung at the High Lord’s heels, dark beards
trimmed and oiled in perfect imitation of Weiramon’s except that his was streaked with gray, and
their breastplates, worn over brightly striped coats, bore goldwork only a touch less ornate than his.
Aloof, apart from everyone else on the hilltop yet close to Rand, they could have been waiting for
some martial ceremony at a royal court, except for the sweat rolling down their faces. They ignored
that as well, though.
The High Lord’s sigil lacked only a few stars to duplicate Lanfear’s, but the long-nosed fellow
was not her in disguise, with his mainly gray hair oiled like his beard and combed in a vain attempt to
hide its thinness. He had been coming north with reinforcements from Tear when he heard that Aiel
were attacking the city of Cairhien itself. Instead of turning back or sitting still, he continued north as
hard as his horses could stand, gathering what forces he found along the way.
That was the good news of Weiramon. The bad was that he had fully expected to dispel the
Shaido around Cairhien with what he had brought. He still did. And he was none too happy that Rand
would not let him be about it or that he was surrounded by Aiel. One Aiel was no different from
another to Weiramon. To the others, too, for that matter. One of the young lords pointedly sniffed a
scented silk handkerchief whenever he looked at an Aiel. Rand wondered how long the fellow would
survive. And what Rand would have to do about it when he died.
Weiramon noticed Rand watching, and cleared his throat. “My Lord Dragon,” he began in a
gravelly bark, “one good charge will scatter them like quail.” He slapped his gauntlets against his
palm loudly. “Foot never stands up to horse. I will send in the Cairhienin to flush them, then follow
with my—”
Rand cut him off. Could the man count at all? Did the number of Aiel he could see here give him
no clue to how many might be around the city? It did not matter. Rand had heard as much of this as he
could stomach. “You are certain of the news you bring from Tear?”
Weiramon blinked. “News, my Lord Dragon? What—? Oh, that. Burn my soul, there’s nothing to
that. Illianer pirates often try to raid along the coast.” They were more than trying, by what the man
had said when he arrived.
“And the attacks on the Plains of Maredo? Do they often do that, as well?”
“Why, burn my soul, those are just brigands.” It was more statement of fact than protest.
“Perhaps not Illianers at all, but certainly not soldiers. The jumble those Illianers make of things, who
can say whether king or Assemblage or Council of Nine has the whiphand on any given day, yet if
they do decide to move, it will be armies striking at Tear under the Golden Bees, not raiders burning
merchants’ wagons and border farms. You can mark me on that.”
“If you wish it,” Rand replied, as politely as he could. Whatever power the Assemblage, or the
Council of Nine, or Mattin Stepaneos den Balgar had, it was what Sammael chose to leave them. But
relatively few knew that the Forsaken were loose already. Some who should know refused to believe,

or ignored it—as if that would make the Forsaken go away—or seemed to think that if it had to
happen, it would be in some vague and preferably distant future. There was no point in trying to
convince Weiramon, whichever group he belonged in. The man’s belief or disbelief changed nothing.
The High Lord scowled at the hollow between the hills. More specifically, at the two Cairhienin
camps. “With no proper rule here as yet, who can say what riffraff have drifted south?” Grimacing, he
slapped his gauntlets even harder before turning back to Rand. “Well, we will bring them to heel soon
enough for you, my Lord Dragon. If you will only give the order, I can drive. . . .”
Rand brushed past him, not listening, though Weiramon followed, still asking authority to attack,
the other two trailing him like heelhounds. The man was a stone-blind fool.
They were not alone, of course. The hilltop was crowded, really. Sulin had a hundred Far
Dareis Mai arrayed around the peak, for one thing, every last one looking even more ready to don her
veil than Aiel usually did. It was not only the nearness of the Shaido that had Sulin on edge. In
mockery of Rand’s contempt for the suspicions in the camps below, Enaila and two Maidens were
never far from Weiramon and his lordlings, and the closer they stood to Rand, the more the three
Maidens looked about to don veils.
Not far off, Aviendha stood talking with a dozen or more Wise Ones, shawls looped over their
elbows, all but she decked in bracelets and necklaces. Surprisingly, it was a bony white-haired
woman, even older than Bair, who seemed to be taking the lead. Rand would have expected Amys or
Bair, but even they shut up as soon as Sorilea spoke. Melaine was with Bael, halfway between the
other Wise Ones and the other clan chiefs. She kept adjusting the coat of Bael’s cadin’sor as if he did
not know how to dress himself, and he had the patient look of a man reminding himself of all the
reasons he had married. It might be personal, but Rand suspected the Wise Ones were trying to
influence the chiefs again. If that was the case, he would learn the particulars soon enough.
It was Aviendha who held Rand’s eye, though. She smiled at him briefly before returning to
listening to Sorilea. A friendly smile, but no more. That was something, he supposed. She had not
lashed out at him once since what had happened between them, and if she sometimes made an acid
comment, it was no sharper than what he might have expected from Egwene. Except the one time he
had brought up marriage again; then she had scorched his ears so thoroughly that he had left it alone
thereafter. But friendly was as far as it went, though she was sometimes careless now about
undressing in front of him at night. She still insisted on sleeping no more than three paces from him.
The Maidens, at any rate, seemed sure that there were a lot fewer than three paces between their
blankets, and he kept expecting that certainty to spread, but so far it had not. Egwene would come
down on him like a falling tree if she even suspected something like that. It was easy enough for her
to talk of Elayne, but he could not even puzzle out Aviendha, and she was right there in front of him.
All in all, he was tenser than ever when he as much as looked at Aviendha, but she seemed more
relaxed than he had ever seen her. Somehow or other, that seemed the opposite of how it should be. It
all seemed topsy-turvy with her. But then, Min was the only woman who had not made him feel as if
he were standing on his head half the time.
Sighing, he walked on, still not listening to Weiramon. One day he was going to understand
women. When he had the time to apply to it. He suspected a lifetime would not be enough, though.
The clan chiefs had their own gathering, of sept chiefs and representatives from the societies.
Rand recognized some of them. Dark Heirn, chief of the Jindo Taardad, and Mangin, who gave him a
companionable nod and the Tairens a contemptuous grimace. Spear-slender Juranai, leader of Aethan
Dor, the Red Shields, on this expedition despite a few streaks of white in his pale brown hair, and
Roidan, thick-shouldered and gray, who led Sha’mad Conde, the Thunder Walkers. Those four had

sometimes joined him in practicing the Aiel way of fighting without weapons since leaving the Jangai
Pass.
“Do you want to go hunting today?” Mangin asked as Rand passed, and Rand looked at him in
surprise.
“Hunting?”
“There is not much to give sport, but we could try catching sheep in a sack.” The wry glance
Mangin darted at the Tairens left little doubt what “sheep” he meant, though Weiramon and the others
did not see. Or affected not to. The lordling with the perfumed handkerchief sniffed it again.
“Another time, maybe,” Rand replied, shaking his head. He thought he could have been friends
with any of the four, but especially Mangin, who had a sense of humor much like Mat’s. If he had no
time to study women, he certainly had no time for making new friends. Little time for old friends, for
that matter. Mat worried him.
On the highest part of the hill, a heavy framework tower of logs thrust above the treetops, the
wide platform at the top twenty spans or more above the ground. The Aiel knew nothing about
working with wood on that scale, but there had been plenty among the Cairhienin refugees who did.
Moiraine was waiting at the base of the first slanting ladder with Lan, and Egwene. Egwene had
been getting a good bit of sun; she really could have passed for Aiel except for her dark eyes. A short
Aiel. He scanned her face quickly, but detected nothing except tiredness. Amys and the others must be
working her too hard with her training. She would not thank him for interceding, though.
“Have you decided?” Rand asked, stopping. Weiramon fell silent at last.
Egwene hesitated, but Rand noted that she did not look at Moiraine before nodding. “I will do
what I can.”
Her reluctance bothered him. He had not asked Moiraine—she could not use the One Power as a
weapon against the Shaido, not unless they threatened her or he managed to convince her they were
all Darkfriends—but Egwene had not taken the Three Oaths, and he had been sure she would see the
necessity. Instead, she had gone white-faced when he suggested it and had avoided for him for three
days until now. At least she had agreed. Whatever made the fight shorter against the Shaido must be
for the good.
Moiraine’s face never changed, though he had no doubt what she thought. Those smooth Aes
Sedai features, those Aes Sedai eyes, could register icy disapproval without altering a jot.
Thrusting the piece of spear through his belt, he put foot to the first rung—and Moiraine spoke.
“Why are you wearing a sword again?”
The last question he would have expected. “Why shouldn’t I?” he muttered, and scrambled
upward. Not a good answer, but she had caught him off balance.
The half-healed wound in his side tugged as he climbed, not quite hurting but seeming about to
break open just the same. He paid it no mind; it often felt that way when he exerted himself.
Rhuarc and the other clan chiefs came after him, Bael leaving Melaine last of all, but thankfully
Weiramon and his two toadies remained on the ground. The High Lord knew what was to be done; he
needed and wanted no more information. Feeling Moiraine’s eyes following him, Rand glanced
down. Not Moiraine. It was Egwene watching him climb, her face so close to Aes Sedai that he could
not have slid a hair through the difference. Moiraine had her head together with Lan’s. He hoped
Egwene was not going to change her mind.
On the broad platform at the top, two short, sweating young men in shirtsleeves were setting a
brass-bound wooden tube, three paces long and bigger around than either’s arm, on a pivoting frame
fastened to the railing. An identical tube already sat a few paces away, where it had been almost

since the tower was completed the day before. A third coatless man wiped his bald head with a
striped kerchief while he growled at them.
“Easy with it. Easy, I said! You motherless weasels knock a lens out of alignment, and I will
knock your brainless heads backward to front. Fasten it tight, Jol. Tight! If it falls while the Lord
Dragon is looking through it, you both had better jump after it. Not just for him. You break my work
and you will wish you had broken your fool skulls.”
Jol and the other fellow, Cail, worked on, quickly but not very visibly perturbed. They had had
years to grow used to Kin Tovere’s way of talking. It had been finding a craftsman who made lenses
and looking glasses—and his two apprentices—among the refugees that had first given Rand the idea
for this tower.
At first none of the three noticed they were not alone. The clan chiefs climbed on silent feet, and
Tovere’s harangue was enough to cover the sound of Rand’s boots. Rand himself was startled when
Lan’s head popped through the open trap after Bael; boots or no, the Warder made no more noise than
the Aiel. Even Han stood a head taller than the Cairhienin.
When they finally did see the new arrivals, the two apprentices gave wide-eyed starts as if they
had never seen an Aiel before, then bent themselves in half bowing to Rand and stayed that way. The
lensmaker jerked almost as much at the sight of the Aiel, but made a more restrained bow, wiping his
head again in the middle of it.
“Told you I would have the second finished today, my Lord Dragon.” Tovere managed to get
respect into his tone without making his voice one bit less gruff. “A wonderful thought, this tower. I
would never have conceived it, but once you started asking how far you could see with a looking
glass . . . Give me time, and I will make you one to see Caemlyn from here. If the tower is built high
enough,” he added judiciously. “There are limits.”
“What you’ve done already is more than enough, Master Tovere.” More than Rand had hoped
for, certainly. He had already had a look through the first looking glass.
Jol and Cail were still bent at right angles, heads down. “Perhaps you had best take your
apprentices below,” Rand said. “So we don’t get crowded.”
There was room for four times as many, but Tovere immediately poked Cail’s shoulder with a
thick finger, “Come along, you ham-fisted stableboys. We are in the Lord Dragon’s way.”
The apprentices barely straightened enough to follow him, gazing round-eyed at Rand even more
than at the Aiel as they vanished down the ladder. Cail was a year older than he, Jol two. Both had
been born in bigger towns than he had imagined before leaving the Two Rivers, had visited Cairhien
and seen the king and the Amyrlin Seat, if at a distance, while he was still tending sheep. Very likely,
they still knew more of the world than he in some ways. Shaking his head, he bent to the new looking
glass.
Cairhien leaped into view. The forests, never particularly thick to one used to Two Rivers’
woods, stopped completely well short of the city, of course. High gray, square-towered walls in a
perfect square against the river mocked the hills’ flowing curves. Within, more towers rose in a
precise pattern, marking the points of a grid, some twenty times as high as the walls or more, yet all
surrounded by scaffolding. The legendary topless towers were still being rebuilt after their burning in
the Aiel War.
When last he had seen the city, another city had surrounded it from riverbank to riverbank—
Foregate, a rabbit warren as raucous as Cairhien was solemn, all in wood. Now only a wide stretch
of ash and charred timbers bordered the walls. How that fire had been kept from spreading into
Cairhien itself, he could not understand.

Banners decked every tower in the city, too distant to make out clearly, but scouts had described
them to him. Half bore the Crescents of Tear; the other half, perhaps not surprisingly, duplicated the
Dragon banner he had left flying over the Stone of Tear. Not one bore the Rising Sun of Cairhien.
Moving the looking glass only a little swept the city from his sight. On the far side of the river
still stood the blackened stone shells of the granaries. Some of the Cairhienin Rand had talked to
claimed the torching of the granaries had led to riots and then King Galldrian’s death, and thus to the
civil war. Others said Galldrian’s assassination had caused the riots and the burning. Rand doubted
that he would ever know which was the truth, or whether either was.
A number of burned-out hulks dotted both banks of the wide river, but none lay close to the city.
Aiel had an uneasiness—fear might be too strong a word—about bodies of water they could not step
across or wade, but Couladin had managed to put barriers of floating logs across the Alguenya both
above and below Cairhien, along with enough men to see they were not cut. Fire-arrows had done the
rest. Nothing except rats and birds could get into or out of Cairhien without Couladin’s leave.
The hills around the city showed little sign of a besieging army. Here and there vultures flapped
heavily, no doubt feasting on the remains of some attempt to break out, but no Shaido were visible.
Aiel seldom were unless they wanted to be.
Wait. Rand swung the looking glass back to a treeless hilltop perhaps a mile from the city walls.
Back to a cluster of men. He could not discern faces, or much else aside from the fact that they all
wore the cadin’sor. One thing more. One of those men had bare arms. Couladin. Rand was sure it
must be imagination, but he thought that when Couladin moved, he could see sunlight glittering off the
metallic scales encircling the man’s forearms in imitation of his own. Asmodean had put those there.
Just an attempt to divert Rand’s attention, to occupy him while Asmodean worked his own plans, but
without that, how much would have turned out differently? Certainly, he would not be standing on this
tower, watching a besieged city and awaiting a battle.
Suddenly, something streaked through the air on that distant hilltop, a long blur, and two of the
men there went down thrashing. Staring at the fallen men, both apparently transfixed with the same
spear, Couladin and the others seemed as stunned as Rand. Twisting the looking glass, Rand scanned
for the man who had thrown with such force. He had to be brave—and a fool—to get close enough.
Rand’s search widened quickly, beyond any possible range of a human arm. He was beginning to
think of Ogier—not likely; it took a great deal to rouse an Ogier into violence—when another
streaking blur caught his eye.
Startled, he half-straightened before jerking the glass back to Cairhien’s walls. That spear—or
whatever it was—had come from there. He was certain of it. How was another matter entirely. At this
distance it was all he could do to make out an occasional someone moving on the walls or atop a
tower.
Raising his head, Rand found Rhuarc just stepping away from the other looking glass, giving up
his place to Han. That was the whole reason for the tower and the glasses. Scouts brought back what
word they could of how the Shaido were deployed, but this way the chiefs could see for themselves
the terrain on which the battle would be fought. They had worked out a plan between them already,
but one more look at the land could never go amiss. Rand did not know much about battles, but Lan
thought their plan a good one. At least, Rand did not know much in his own mind; sometimes those
other memories crept in, and then he seemed to know more than he wanted.
“Did you see that? Those . . . spears?”
Rhuarc looked as puzzled as Rand knew he himself must, but the Aiel nodded. “The last took
another Shaido, but he crawled away. Not Couladin, worse luck.” He gestured to the looking glass,

and Rand let him take his place.
Was it such bad luck? Couladin’s death would not end the threat to Cairhien, or to anywhere
else. Now they were this side of the Dragonwall, the Shaido would not tamely return just because the
man they thought was the true Car’a’carn died. It might well shake them, but not enough for that. And
after all Rand had seen, he did not think Couladin deserved so easy a way out. I can be as hard as I
must, he thought, stroking his sword hilt. For him, I can.

CHAPTER
42

Before the Arrow

The inside of a tent roof had to be the most boring sight in the world, but lying back in his
shirtsleeves on scarlet-tasseled cushions that Melindhra had acquired, Mat studied the gray-brown
cloth intently. Or rather, he stared beyond it. One arm curled behind his head, he swirled a
hammered-silver goblet full of good wine from the south of Cairhien. A small cask had cost him as
much as two good horses would—as much as two horses would have if the world and everything in it
had not been stood on its head—but he counted it a small price for something decent. Sometimes a
drop or two splashed over onto his hand, but he never noticed and he never took a drink.
By his book, matters had long since gone beyond merely serious. Serious was being stuck in the
Waste with no idea of the way out. Serious was Darkfriends popping up when you least expected,
Trolloc attacks in the night, the odd Myrddraal freezing your blood with an eyeless stare. That sort of
thing came quickly, and usually was done before you had much chance to think. It was certainly not
what you would seek out, yet if you had to, you could live with it if you could live through it. But for
days he had known where they were heading, and why. Nothing quick about it. Days to think.
I am no bloody hero, he thought grimly, and I’m no bloody soldier. Fiercely he pushed down a
memory of walking fortress walls, ordering his last reserves to where another crop of Trolloc scaling
ladders had sprung up. That was not me, the Light burn whoever it was! I’m . . . He did not know
what he was—a sour thought—but whatever he was, it involved gambling and taverns, women and
dancing. That he was sure of. It involved a good horse and every road in the world to choose from,
not sitting and waiting for somebody to shoot arrows at him or try to stick a sword or a spear through
his ribs. Any different would make him a fool, and he would not be that, not for Rand or Moiraine or
anybody else.
As he sat up, the silver foxhead medallion, hanging on its leather thong, slipped from the unlaced
neck of his shirt. He tucked it back before taking a long swallow of wine. The medallion made him
safe from Moiraine, or any other Aes Sedai, as long as they did not get it away from him—surely one
or another would try sooner or later—but nothing except his own wits kept him safe from some fool
killing him along with a few thousand other fools. Or from Rand, or from being ta’veren.
A man ought to be able to find a profit in something like that, having events twist themselves
around him. Rand certainly had, in a way. He himself had never noticed anything twisting around him
except the fall of dice. He would not turn away from some of the things that happened to ta’veren in
stories. Wealth and fame dropped into their pockets as if from the sky; men who wanted to kill them
decided to follow instead, and women with ice in their eyes decided to melt.
Not that he was complaining at what he had, really. And certainly not that he wanted anything
like Rand’s bargain; the price to get into the game was too high. It was just that he seemed to be stuck

with all the burdens of being ta’veren and none of the pleasure.
“It is time to go,” he told the empty tent, then paused thoughtfully and sipped at the goblet. “It is
time to get on Pips and ride. Ride to Caemlyn, maybe.” Not a bad city, so long as he avoided the
Royal Palace. “Or Lugard.” He had heard rumors about Lugard. A fine place, that, for the likes of
him. “Time to leave Rand in my dust. He’s got a bloody Aiel army and more Maidens than he can
count taking care of him. He doesn’t need me.”
That last was not strictly true. In some strange way he was tied to Rand’s success or failure in
Tarmon Gai’don, him and Perrin both, three ta’veren all tangled together. The histories would
probably only mention Rand. Small chance he or Perrin would find any place in the stories. And then
there was the Horn of Valere. Which he did not want to think about, and would not. Not until he had
to. There might be some way out of that particular mess yet. Any way he looked at it, the Horn was a
problem for another day. A distant day. With luck, all those bills would come due on a very distant
day. Only, that might take more luck than he had.
The point now was that he had said all of that about going and felt scarcely a twinge. Not long
ago, he had been unable even to speak of leaving; when he got too far from Rand, he had been drawn
back like a hooked fish on some invisible line. Then he had become able to say it, even to lay plans,
but the slightest thing would distract him, make him put off his schemes for stealing away. Even in
Rhuidean, when he had told Rand he was going, he had been sure something would get in the way. It
had, in a manner of speaking; Mat had made it out of the Waste, but he was no further from Rand than
before. This time, he did not think he would be diverted.
“Not like I was abandoning him,” he muttered. “If he can’t bloody take care of himself by now,
he’ll never be able to. I’m not his bloody nursemaid.”
Draining the goblet, he scrambled into his green coat, settled his knives in their hiding places,
arranged a dark yellow silk scarf to hide the hanging scar on his throat, then snatched up his hat and
ducked out.
Heat hit him in the face after the relatively cool shade inside. He was not sure how the seasons
changed here, but summer was hanging on too long to suit him. One thing he had looked forward to on
leaving the Waste was the arrival of autumn. A little coolness. No luck here. At least the hat’s wide
brim kept the sun off.
This hilly Cairhienin forest was a pitiful thing, more clearings than trees and half of them going
brown in the drought. Not a patch on the Westwood, back home. Low Aiel tents were everywhere,
though at any distance they took on the look of a pile of dead leaves or a bare hummock of ground
unless the side flaps were up, and even then they were not easy to see. The Aiel going about their
business did not look at him twice.
From one crest as he crossed the encampment, he caught sight of Kadere’s wagons, all in a
circle, the drivers lying in the shade underneath and the peddler nowhere in view. Kadere kept to his
wagon more and more, seldom poking his nose out except when Moiraine came to inspect the ladings.
The Aiel ringing the wagons, small knots with spears and bucklers, bows and quivers, made little
pretense of being anything but guards. Moiraine must think Kadere or some of his men would try to
make off with what she had brought out of Rhuidean. Mat wondered whether Rand realized that he
was giving her anything and everything she asked. For a while Mat had thought Rand had gotten the
upper hand there, but he was not so sure any longer, even if Moiraine did do everything but curtsy and
fetch Rand’s pipe.
Rand’s tent was on a hilltop by itself, naturally, that red banner on a staff at its front. It rippled in
a light breeze, sometimes standing out enough to show the black-and-white disc. The thing made

Mat’s skin crawl as much as the Dragon banner had. If a man wanted to avoid Aes Sedai
entanglements, as any but an idiot would, the last thing to do was wave that symbol about.
The slopes of the hill were bare, but Maidens’ tents encircled the foot of the hill and spread
through the trees up surrounding slopes and down the other side. That was as usual, too, and so was
the Wise Ones’ camp within the Far Dareis Mai, dozens of low tents in shouting distance of Rand’s
hill, with white-robed gai’shain bustling about.
There were only a few of the Wise Ones to be seen, yet they made up for lack of numbers with
the stares that followed him. He had no idea how many could channel in that bunch, but they were a
fair equal of Aes Sedai weighing and measuring when it came to stares. He picked up his pace,
making an effort not to shrug uncomfortably; he could feel those eyes on his back as surely as he could
have a poke from a stick. And he would have to run the same gauntlet coming out. Well, a few words
with Rand, and it would be the last time he had to run it.
Only, when he pulled off his hat and ducked into Rand’s tent, no one was there except Natael,
lounging on the cushions with his gilded, dragon-carved harp propped against his knee and a gold
goblet in his hand.
Mat grimaced, and swore under his breath. He should have known as much. If Rand had been
here, he would have had to pass through a circle of Maidens right around the tent. Most likely he was
up at that new-built tower. A good idea, that. Know the terrain. That was the second rule, close
behind “Know your enemy,” and not much to choose between them.
The thought put a sour twist to his mouth. Those rules came from other men’s memories; the only
rules he wanted to remember were “Never kiss a girl whose brothers have knife scars” and “Never
gamble without knowing a back way out.” He almost wished those memories of other men were still
separate lumps in his brain instead of oozing into his thoughts when he least expected.
“Trouble with a bilious stomach?” Natael asked lazily. “One of the Wise Ones might have a root
to cure it. Or you could try Moiraine.”
Mat could not like the man; he always seemed to be thinking of a joke he did not mean to share.
And he always looked as if he had three servants taking care of his clothes. All that snowy lace at
collar and cuffs, always seeming freshly laundered. The fellow never appeared to sweat, either. Why
Rand wanted him around was a mystery. He almost never played anything merry on that harp. “Will
he be back soon?”
Natael shrugged. “When he decides to. Perhaps soon, perhaps late. No man clocks the Lord
Dragon. And few women.” There it was again, that secretive smile. A touch bleak, this time.
“I’ll wait.” He meant to go through with this. Too many times he had found himself putting off
going.
Natael sipped at his wine, studying him across the goblet’s rim.
It was bad enough that Moiraine and the Wise Ones watched him in that silent, searching way—
sometimes Egwene did, too; she had certainly changed, half Wise One and half Aes Sedai—but from
Rand’s gleeman, it was enough to set his teeth on edge. The best thing about leaving would be not
having anyone look at him as if they would know in a minute what he was thinking, and already knew
whether his smallclothes were clean.
Two maps lay spread out near the firepit. One, copied in detail from a tattered map found in a
half-burned town, covered northern Cairhien from west of the Alguenya halfway to the Spine of the
World, while, the other, newly drawn and sketchy, showed the land around the city. Slips of
parchment held down with pebbles dotted both. If he was going to stay, and ignore Natael’s searching
look at the same time, there was nothing for it but to study the maps.

With the toe of his boot he shifted a few pebbles on the map of the city so he could read what
was written on the parchments. In spite of himself, he winced. If the Aiel scouts could count,
Couladin had nearly one hundred and sixty thousand spears—Shaido and those who had supposedly
gone to join their societies among the Shaido. A hard nut to crack, and prickly. This side of the Spine
of the World had not seen an army like that since Artur Hawkwing’s time.
The second map showed the other clans that had crossed the Dragonwall. All had now, in one
force or another, strung out according to when they had left the Jangai and spread apart, but too close
to here for comfort. The Shiande, the Codarra, the Daryne, and the Miagoma. Between them, they
apparently had at least as many spears as Couladin; they had not left many behind, if that was true.
The seven clans with Rand almost doubled that, easily enough to face Couladin or the four clans.
Either or. Not both, not at once. But both at once might be what Rand had to fight.
What the Aiel called the bleakness had to be affecting those clans, too—every day still men
tossed down their weapons and vanished—but only a fool would think it lessened their numbers any
more than it did Rand’s. And there was always the possibility that some of those were going to
Couladin. The Aiel did not speak of it very much or very freely, and masked the idea behind talk of
joining societies, but even now, men and Maidens decided they could not accept Rand or what he had
told them of themselves. Every morning some were missing, and not all left their spears behind.
“A pretty situation, wouldn’t you say?”
Mat’s head jerked up at Lan’s voice, but the Warder had entered the tent alone. “Just something
to look at while I waited. Is Rand coming back?”
“He will be with us soon.” Thumbs tucked behind his sword belt, Lan stood beside Mat, looking
down at the map. His face gave away as much as a statue’s would. “Tomorrow should bring the
largest battle since Artur Hawkwing.”
“You don’t say?” Where was Rand? Still up on that tower, probably. Maybe he should go there.
No, he could end up haring all over the camp, always one step behind. Rand would come here
eventually. He wanted to talk about something besides Couladin. This fight is none of mine. I’m not
running away from anything that concerns me in the least. “What about them?” He gestured to the
slips representing the Miagoma and the others. “Any word on whether they mean to join Rand, or do
they just intend to sit there watching?”
“Who can say? Rhuarc doesn’t seem to know any more than I do, and if the Wise Ones do, they
are not telling. The only thing certain is that Couladin is not going anywhere.”
Couladin again. Mat shifted uncomfortably and took a half-step toward the entrance. No, he
would wait. Fastening his gaze on the maps, he pretended to study them further. Perhaps Lan would
leave him in silence. He just wanted to say his piece to Rand and go.
The Warder appeared to want to talk, though. “What do you think, Master Gleeman? Should we
rush down on Couladin with everything and crush him tomorrow?”
“That sounds as good to me as any other plan,” Natael replied dourly. Emptying the goblet down
his throat, he dropped it on the carpets and picked up the harp to begin softly strumming something
dark and funereal. “I lead no armies, Warder. I command nothing save myself, and not always that.”
Mat grunted, and Lan glanced at him before returning to his study of the maps. “You do not think
it a good plan? Why not?”
He said it so casually that Mat answered without thinking. “Two reasons. If you surround
Couladin, trap him between you and the city, you might crush him against it.” How long was Rand
going to be? “But you might push him right over the walls, too. From what I hear, he’s nearly gotten
over twice already, even without miners or siege engines, and the city is hanging on by its teeth.” Say

his piece and go, that was it. “Press him enough, and you’ll find yourself fighting inside Cairhien.
Nasty thing, fighting in a city. And the idea is to save the place, not finish ruining it.” Those slips laid
out on the maps, the maps themselves, made it all so clear.
Frowning, he squatted with his elbows on his knees. Lan got down with him, but he hardly
noticed. A dicey problem. And fascinating. “Best if you try to shove him away. Hit him from the
south, mainly.” He pointed to the River Gaelin; it joined the Alguenya some miles north of the city.
“There are bridges up here. Leave the Shaido a clear path to them. Always leave a way out, unless
you really want to find out how hard a man can fight when he’s nothing to lose.” His finger slid east.
Wooded hills for the most part, it seemed. Probably not much different from right around here. “A
blocking force here on this side of the river will make sure they go for the bridges, if it’s big enough
and positioned right. Once they are moving, Couladin won’t want to try fighting someone ahead of
him while you’re coming behind.” Yes. Almost exactly the same as at Jenje. “Not unless he’s a
complete fool, anyway. They might make it to the river in good order, but those bridges will choke
them. I don’t see Aiel swimming, or hunting out fords for that matter. Keep the pressure on, shove
them across. With luck you’ll be able to harry them all the way to the mountains.” It was like
Cuaindaigh Fords, too, late in the Trolloc Wars, and on much the same scale. Not much different from
the Tora Shan, either. Or Sulmein Gap, before Hawkwing found his stride. The names flickered
through his head, the images of bloody fields forgotten even by historians. Absorbed in the map as he
was, they did not register as anything but his own remembrances. “Too bad you don’t have more
cavalry. Light cavalry is best for the harrying. Bite at the flanks, keep them running, and never let them
settle to fight. But Aiel should do almost as well.”
“And the other reason?” Lan asked quietly.
Mat was caught up in it, now. He more than merely liked gambling, and battle was a gamble to
make dicing in taverns a thing for children and toothless invalids. Lives were the stake here, your
own and other men’s, men who were not even there. Make the wrong wager, a foolish bet, and cities
died, or whole nations. Natael’s somber music was fit accompaniment. At the same time, this was a
game that set the blood racing.
Without lifting his eyes from the map, he snorted. “You know as well as I. If even one of those
four clans decides to side with Couladin, they’ll take you from behind while your hands are still full
of Shaido. Couladin will be the anvil and they the hammer, with you the nut between. Only take half
of what you have against Couladin. That makes it an even fight, but you have to settle for it.” There
was no such thing as fairness in war. You took your enemy from behind, when he least expected it,
when and where he was weakest. “You still have an edge. He has to worry about a sortie from the
city. The other half, you split in three parts. One to funnel Couladin to the river, the other two a few
miles apart, between the city and the four clans.”
“Very neat,” Lan said, nodding. That slab-carved face never changed, but approval touched his
voice, if lightly. “It would gain a clan nothing to attack either force, especially not when the other
could take it in the rear. And none will try to interfere in what happens around the city for the same
reason. Of course, all four could join. Not likely, if they haven’t already, but if they do, everything
changes.”
Mat laughed aloud. “Everything always changes. The best plan lasts until the first arrow leaves
the bow. This would be easy enough for a child to handle, except for Indirian and the rest not knowing
their own minds. If they all decide to go over to Couladin, you toss the dice and hope, because the
Dark One’s in the game for sure. At least you’ll have enough strength clear of the city nearly to match
them. Enough to hold them for the time you need. Abandon the idea of pursuing Couladin and turn

everything on them as soon as he’s well and truly begun crossing the Gaelin. But it’s my bet they’ll
wait and watch, and come to you once Couladin is done for. Victory settles a lot of arguments in most
men’s heads.”
The music had stopped. Mat glanced at Natael, and found the man holding his harp rigidly,
staring at him over it harder than ever. Staring as if he had never seen him before, did not know what
he was. The gleeman’s eyes were dark polished glass, his knuckles white on the harp’s gilding.
With that it all crashed home, what he had been saying, the memories he had been embracing.
Burn you for a fool for not guarding your tongue! Why had Lan had to take the conversation that
way? Why could he not have talked about horses, or the weather, or just kept his mouth shut? The
Warder had never seemed all that eager to talk before. Usually the man made a tree seem talkative. Of
course, he could have kept his own mind focused and his own mouth shut, too. At least he had not
been babbling in the Old Tongue. Blood and ashes, but I hope I wasn’t!
Springing to his feet, Mat turned to go, and found Rand standing just inside the tent, absently
twisting that odd bit of tasseled spear as if he did not realize he was holding it. How long had he been
there? It did not matter. Mat spilled it all out in a rush. “I’m leaving, Rand. Come first light in the
morning, I am in the saddle and gone. I’d go this minute if I could get far enough in half a day to suit
me for stopping. I mean to put as many miles between me and the Aiel—any Aiel—as Pips can cover
before I make camp.” No point in bedding down close enough to be snapped up and hung out to dry by
somebody’s scouts; Couladin must have them out, too, and even the others might not recognize him
before he had a spear in his liver.
“I will be sorry to see you go,” Rand said quietly.
“Don’t try to talk me out of—” Mat blinked. “That’s it? You’ll be sorry to see me go?”
“I’ve never tried to make you stay, Mat. Perrin went when he had to, and so can you.”
Mat opened his mouth, then closed it again. Rand had never tried to make him stay, true. He had
just done it without trying. But there was not the slightest bit of ta’veren tugging, now, no vague
feelings that he was doing the wrong thing. He was firm and clear in his purpose.
“Where will you go?”
“South.” Not that there was much choice of direction. The others led to the Gaelin, with nothing
north of the river that he was interested in, or else to Aiel, one lot that would certainly kill him and
one that might or might not, depending on how close by Rand was and what they had had for supper
the night before. Not good odds, by his reckoning. “To begin, anyway. Then somewhere there’s a
tavern, and some women who don’t carry spears.” Melindhra. She might present a problem. He had
the feeling she might be the sort of woman who did not let go until she wanted. Well, one way or
another, he would deal with her. Maybe he could just ride out before she knew it. “This isn’t for me,
Rand. I don’t know anything about battles, and I don’t want to know.” He avoided looking at Lan and
Natael. If either man cracked his teeth, he would punch him right in the mouth. Even the Warder. “You
understand, don’t you?”
Rand’s nod could have been understanding. Maybe it was. “I’d forget saying goodbye to
Egwene, were I you. I am no longer certain how much of what I tell her I might as well be telling
Moiraine, or the Wise Ones, or both.”
“I reached that conclusion a long time ago. She’s left Emond’s Field further behind than either of
us. And regrets it less.”
“Maybe,” Rand said sadly. “The Light shine on you, Mat,” he added, sticking out his hand, “and
send you smooth roads, fair weather and pleasant company until we meet again.”
That would not be soon, if Mat had his way. He felt a little sad about that, and a little foolish for

feeling sad, yet a man had to look after himself. When all was said and done, that was the long and
short of it.
Rand’s grip was as hard as it had ever been—all that swordwork had only added new calluses
atop older bowman’s—but the ridged heron brand in his palm was distinct against Mat’s hand. Just a
little reminder, in case he should forget the markings under his friend’s coatsleeves, or those even
stranger things inside his head that let him channel. If he could forget that Rand could channel—and he
had not thought of it once in days; days!—then it was far past time to be gone.
A few more awkward words standing there—Lan seemed to ignore them, arms folded, silently
studying the maps, while Natael had begun idly plucking his harp; Mat had an ear for music, and to
him the unfamiliar tune had an ironic sound; he wondered why the fellow had chosen it—a few more
moments and Rand half-stepping around actually putting an end to it, and then Mat was outside. There
was a crowd out there, a good hundred Maidens spread about the hilltop and walking on tiptoe they
were so ready to spear somebody, all seven clan chiefs waiting patient and still as stone, three Tairen
lords trying to pretend that they were not sweating and the Aiel did not exist.
He had heard about the lords’ arrival, and had even gone to take a look at their camp—or camps
—but there had been no one there he knew, and no one wanting to take a turn at dice or cards. These
three eyed him up and down, frowning disdainfully, and apparently decided he was no better than the
Aiel, which was to say not worth seeing.
Clapping his hat on his head and pulling the brim low over his eyes, Mat studied the Tairens
coldly in return for a moment. He had the pleasure of seeing the younger pair, at least, become
uncomfortably aware of him again before he started down the hill. The gray-beard still looked all
barely concealed impatience to enter Rand’s tent, but it did not matter anyway. He would never see
any of them again.
He had no idea why he had not simply ignored them. Except that his step was lighter and he felt
full of vinegar. No wonder, really, leaving tomorrow at last. The dice seemed to be spinning in his
head, and there was no knowing what pips would show when they landed. Odd, that. It must be
Melindhra worrying him. Yes. He would definitely leave early, and as quietly as a mouse tiptoeing on
feathers.
Whistling, he set off for his tent. What was the tune? Oh, yes. “Dance with Jak o’ the Shadows.”
He had no intention of dancing with death, but it had a merry sound, so he whistled it anyway as he
tried to plan the best route away from Cairhien.
Rand stood staring after Mat long after the tent flaps had fallen to hide him. “I only heard the last
bit,” he said finally. “Was it all like that?”
“Very nearly,” Lan replied. “With only a few minutes to study the maps, he laid out close to the
battle plan that Rhuarc and the others made. He saw the difficulties and the dangers, and how to meet
them. He knows about miners and siege engines, and using light cavalry to harry a defeated foe.”
Rand looked at him. The Warder showed no surprise, not the twitch of an eyelash. Of course, he
was the one who had said Mat seemed surprisingly knowledgeable about military matters. And Lan
was not going to ask the obvious question, either, which was good. Rand had no right to give the little
answer he had.
He could have asked a few questions himself. Such as, What did miners have to do with battles?
Or maybe it was only sieges. Whatever the answer, there was not a mine closer than the Kinslayer’s
Dagger, and no certainty anyone was still digging ore. Well, this battle would be fought without. The
important thing was that he knew Mat had gained more on the other side of that doorway ter’angreal

than a tendency to spout the Old Tongue when not thinking. And knowing that, Rand would surely
make use of it.
You don’t have to get any harder, he thought bitterly. He had seen Mat climbing toward this
tent, and never hesitated in sending Lan in to discover what might come to the surface in idle
conversation, alone. That had been deliberate. The rest might or might not be, but it would happen. He
hoped Mat had a fine time while he was free. He hoped that Perrin was enjoying himself in the Two
Rivers, showing off Faile to his mother and sisters, maybe marrying her. He hoped it because he
knew he would draw them back, ta’veren pulling at ta’veren, and he the strongest. Moiraine had
named it no coincidence, three such growing up in the same village, all nearly the same age; the
Wheel wove happenstance and coincidence into the Pattern, but it did not lay down the likes of the
three of them for no reason. Eventually he would pull his friends back to him, however far they went,
and when they came, he would use them, however he could. However he had to. Because he did have
to. Because whatever the Prophecy of the Dragon said, he was sure the only chance he had of winning
Tarmon Gai’don lay in having all three of them, three ta’veren who had been tied together since
infancy, tied together once more. No, he did not need to become hard. You’re rank enough already to
make a Seanchan spew his supper!
“Play ‘March of Death,’ ” he commanded in a harsher voice than he wanted, and Natael looked
at him blankly for a moment. The man had been listening to everything. He would have questions, but
he would find no answers. If Rand could not tell Lan Mat’s secrets, he would not spread them before
one of the Forsaken, however tame he appeared. This time he deliberately made his tone rough, and
pointed the length of spear at the man. “Play it, unless you know a sadder. Play something to make
your soul weep. If you have one still.”
Natael gave him an ingratiating smile and a seated bow, but he went white around the eyes. It
was indeed “The March of Death” that he began, yet it had a sharper edge on his harp than ever
before, a dirgelike keen that surely would make any soul weep. He stared fixedly at Rand as if hoping
to see some effect.
Turning away, Rand stretched out on the carpets with his head to the maps and a red-and-gold
cushion under his elbow. “Lan, would you ask the others to come in now?”
The Warder made a formal bow before stepping outside. It was the first time that he had ever
done that, but Rand noticed only absently.
The battle would begin tomorrow. It was a polite fiction that he helped Rhuarc and the others
plan. He was smart enough to know what he did not know, and despite all of his talks with Lan and
Rhuarc, he knew he was not ready. I’ve planned a hundred battles this size or more and given
orders that led to ten times as many. Not his thought. Lews Therin knew war—had known war—but
not Rand al’Thor, and that was him. He listened, asked questions—and nodded as if he understood
when the chiefs said a thing should be done a certain way. Sometimes he did understand and wished
he did not, because he knew where that understanding came from. His only real contribution had been
to say that Couladin had to be defeated without destroying the city. In any case, this meeting would
only add a few touches at most to what had already been decided. Mat would have been useful, with
his new-found knowledge.
No. He would not think of his friends, of what he would do to them before it was all done. Even
leaving the battle aside, there was plenty to occupy him, things he could do something about. The
absence of Cairhienin flags above Cairhien marked a major problem, and the continued skirmishes
with Andorans another. What Sammael was up to warranted thought, and . . .
The chiefs filed in in no particular order. This time Dhearic came first, Rhuarc and Erim

together at the rear with Lan. Bruan and Jheran took the places next to Rand. They did not concern
themselves with precedence among themselves, and Aan’allein they seemed to take as all but one of
them.
Weiramon entered last, his lordlings at his heels and a tight-mouthed scowl on his face.
Precedence certainly mattered to him. Muttering into his oiled beard, he stalked his way around the
firepit, taking up a place behind Rand. Until the chiefs’ flat stares finally broke through his shell, at
least. Among Aiel, a close kinsman or society brother might position himself so, if there was the
possibility of a knife in the back. He still frowned at Jheran and Dhearic as though expecting one of
them to make room.
Finally Bael gestured to the place beside him, across the maps from Rand, and after a pause,
Weiramon strode back to sit cross-legged and rigid, staring straight ahead and looking like a man who
had swallowed an unripe plum whole. The younger Tairens stood almost as stiffly at his back, one
with the grace to look embarrassed.
Rand took note of him but said not a word, only thumbed his pipe full of tabac and seized saidin
long enough to light it. He had to do something about Weiramon; the man exacerbated old problems
and made new ones. Not a flicker crossed Rhuarc’s features, but the other chiefs’ expressions ranged
from Han’s sour disgust to Erim’s clear, cold-eyed readiness to dance spears there and then. Perhaps
there was a way for Rand to rid himself of Weiramon and make a beginning on another of his worries
at the same time.
With Rand’s example, Lan and the chiefs began filling pipes.
“I see only small changes necessary,” Bael said, puffing his pipe alight, and sparking a glower
from Han, as usual.
“Do these small changes concern the Goshien, or perhaps some other clan?”
Putting Weiramon from his mind, Rand bent himself to listening as they worked out what had to
be altered from their new view of the terrain. Now and again one of the Aiel would glance at Natael,
a brief tightness to eyes or mouth suggesting that the mournful music plucked at something in him.
Even the Tairens grimaced sadly. The sounds washed over Rand, though, touching nothing. Tears
were a luxury he could no longer afford, not even inside.

CHAPTER
43

This Place, This Day

The next morning Rand was up and dressed well before first light. In truth, he had not slept, and
it had not been Aviendha who kept him awake, not even after she began undressing before he could
put out the lamps and channeled one alight again as soon as he did, chiding him that she was unable to
see in the dark even if he could. He made no reply, and hours later, had hardly noticed when she rose,
a good hour before he did, dressed and left. He did not even think to wonder where she was going.
The thoughts that had had him staring up into the blackness still ran through his head. Men would
die today. A great many men, even if everything went perfectly. Nothing he did now would change it;
today would run out according to the Pattern. But over and over he mulled the decisions he had made
since he first entered the Waste. Could he have done something different, something that would have
avoided this day, this place? Next time, perhaps. The tasseled length of spear lay atop his sword belt
and scabbarded blade beside his blankets. There would be a next time, and one beyond that, and
beyond again.
While darkness still held, the chiefs came in a bunch for a few final words, to report that their
men were in position and ready. Not that anything else was expected. Stone-faced as they were, some
emotion showed. An odd mix, though, a skim of ebullience over somberness.
Erim actually wore a slight smile. “A good day, to see the end of the Shaido,” he said finally. He
seemed to be walking on his toes.
“The Light willing,” Bael said, his head brushing the roof of the tent, “we will wash the spears
in Couladin’s blood before sunfall.”
“Bad luck to talk of what will be,” Han muttered. The skim was very thin on him, of course.
“Fate will decide.”
Rand nodded. “The Light send it does not decide on too many of our number dead.” He wished
his concern were only that few men should die because men should not have their lives cut short, but
there were many more days to come. He would need every spear to bring order to this side of the
Dragonwall. That was a bone between him and Couladin every bit as much as the rest.
“Life is a dream,” Rhuarc told him, and Han and the others nodded agreement. Life was only a
dream, and all dreams had to end. Aiel did not run toward death, yet they did not run from it either.
As they were departing, Bael paused. “Are you certain of what you want the Maidens to do?
Sulin has been speaking to the Wise Ones.”
So that was what Melaine had been at Bael about. The way Rhuarc stopped to listen, he had
been hearing from Amys on the subject, too.
“Everyone else is doing what they are supposed to without complaining, Bael.” That was unfair,
but this was no game. “If the Maidens want special consideration, Sulin can come to me, not go

running to the Wise Ones.”
Had they been anything but Aiel, Rhuarc and Bael would have been shaking their heads as they
left. Rand supposed each would get an earful from his wife, but they would have to live with it. If Far
Dareis Mai carried his honor, this time they would carry it where he wanted.
To Rand’s surprise Lan appeared just as he was ready to go out himself. The Warder’s cloak
hung down his back, disturbing the vision as it rippled with his movements.
“Is Moiraine with you?” Rand had expected Lan to be glued to her side.
“She is fretting in her tent. She cannot possibly Heal even all of the worst hurt today.” That was
her choice of how to help; she could not use the Power as a weapon today, but she could Heal.
“Waste always angers her.”
“It angers us all,” Rand snapped. His taking Egwene away probably upset her, too. As far as he
could tell, Egwene was not very good at Healing on her own, but she could have aided Moiraine.
Well, he needed her to keep her promise. “Tell Moiraine if she needs help, ask some of the Wise
Ones who can channel.” But few Wise Ones had any knowledge of Healing. “She can link with them
and use their strength.” He hesitated. Had Moiraine ever spoken of linking to him? “You didn’t come
here to tell me Moiraine is brooding,” he said irritably. It was difficult sometimes, keeping straight
what came from her, what from Asmodean, and what bubbled up from Lews Therin.
“I came to ask why you’ve taken to wearing a sword again.”
“Moiraine asked already. Did she send—?”
Lan’s face did not change, but he cut in roughly. “I want to know. You can make a sword from
the Power, or kill without, but suddenly you are wearing steel on your hip again. Why?”
Unconsciously, Rand ran one hand up the long hilt at his side. “It’s hardly fair to use the Power
that way. Especially against someone who can’t channel. I might as well fight a child.”
The Warder stood silent for a time, studying him. “You mean to kill Couladin yourself,” he said
at last in flat tones. “That sword against his spears.”
“I don’t mean to seek him out, but who can say what will happen?” Rand shrugged
uncomfortably. Not to hunt for him. But if ever his twisting of chance was to favor him, let it be to
bring him face-to-face with Couladin. “Besides, I’d not put it past him to seek me. The threats I’ve
heard from him have been personal, Lan.” Raising one fist, he thrust his arm out of a crimson
coatsleeve enough to make the golden-maned Dragon’s fore end plainly visible. “Couladin won’t rest
while I live, not so long as we both wear these.”
And truth to tell, he would not rest himself until only one living man bore the Dragons. By rights
he should lump Asmodean in with Couladin. Asmodean had marked the Shaido. But Couladin’s
unrestrained ambition had made it possible; his ambition and refusal to abide by Aiel law and custom
had led inevitably to this place, this day. Beyond the bleakness and war between Aiel, there was
Taien to be laid at Couladin’s feet, and Selean, and dozens of ruined towns and villages since,
countless hundreds of burned farms. Unburied men and women and children had fed the vultures. If he
was the Dragon Reborn, if he had any right to demand that any nation follow him, much less Cairhien,
then he owed them justice.
“Then have him beheaded when he’s taken,” Lan said harshly. “Set a hundred men, or a
thousand, with no purpose but to find and take him. But do not be fool enough to fight him! You are
good with a blade now—very good—but Aielmen are all but born with spear and buckler in hand. A
spear through your heart, and all has been for naught.”
“So I should avoid the fighting? Would you, if Moiraine had no claims on you? Will Rhuarc, or
Bael, or any of them?”

“I am not the Dragon Reborn. The fate of the world does not rest on me.” But the momentary heat
had gone from his voice. Without Moiraine, he would have been wherever the fighting was hottest. If
anything, he looked to be regretting those claims at the moment.
“I’ll not take needless risks, Lan, but I can’t run from them all.” The Seanchan spear would
remain in the tent today; it would only get in his way if he did find Couladin. “Come. The Aiel will
finish it without us if we stand here much longer.”
When he ducked outside, only a few stars remained, and a thin brightness outlined the eastern
horizon sharply. That was not why he stopped, though, and Lan with him. Maidens made a ring around
the tent, shoulder to shoulder, facing inward. A thick ring that spread down the dark shrouded slopes,
cadin’sor-clad women jammed so a mouse could not have slipped through. Jeade’en was nowhere in
sight, though a gai’shain had been ordered to have him saddled and waiting.
Not Maidens alone. Two women in the front rank wore bulky skirts and pale blouses, their hair
bound back with folded scarves. It was too black yet to discern faces with any certainty, but there
was something in the shape of those two, in their folded-arm stance, that named Egwene and
Aviendha.
Sulin stepped forward before he could open his mouth to ask what they were up to. “We have
come to escort the Car’a’carn to the tower with Egwene Sedai and Aviendha.”
“Who put you up to this?” Rand demanded. One glance at Lan showed it had not been him. Even
in the darkness the Warder looked startled. For a moment anyway, his head jerking up; nothing
surprised Lan for long. “Egwene is supposed to be on her way to the tower now, and the Maidens are
supposed to be there to guard her. What she will do today is very important. She must be protected
while she does it.”
“We will protect her.” Sulin’s voice was as flat as a planed board. “And the Car’a’carn, who
gave his honor to Far Dareis Mai to carry.” A murmur of approval rippled through the Maidens.
“It only makes sense, Rand,” Egwene said from where she stood. “If one using the Power as a
weapon will make the battle shorter, three will shorten it even more. And you are stronger than
Aviendha and me together.” She did not sound as if she liked saying that last. Aviendha said nothing,
but the way she stood was eloquent.
“This is ridiculous,” Rand scowled. “Let me through, and go to your assigned place.”
Sulin did not budge. “Far Dareis Mai carries the honor of the Car’a’carn,” she said calmly, and
others took it up. No louder, but from so many women’s voices it made a high rumble. “Far Dareis
Mai carries the honor of the Car’a’carn. Far Dareis Mai carries the honor of the Car’a’carn.”
“I said let me through,” he demanded the instant the sound died.
As if he had told them to begin again, they did. “Far Dareis Mai carries the honor of the
Car’a’carn. Far Dareis Mai carries the honor of the Car’a’carn.” Sulin just stood there looking at
him.
After a moment Lan leaned close to murmur dryly, “A woman is no less a woman because she
carries a spear. Did you ever meet one who could be diverted from anything she really wanted? Give
over, or we will stand here all day while you argue and they chant at you.” The Warder hesitated,
then added, “Besides which, it does make sense.”
Egwene opened her mouth as the litany fell off once more, but Aviendha put a hand on her arm
and whispered a few words, and Egwene said nothing. He knew what she had intended to say, though.
She had been about to tell him he was a stubborn foolish woolhead or some such.
The trouble was that he was beginning to feel like one. It did make sense for him to go to the
tower. He had nothing to do elsewhere—the battle was in the hands of the chiefs and fate, now—and

he would be of more use channeling than riding around hoping to meet with Couladin. If being
ta’veren could pull Couladin to him, it could draw him to the tower as easily as anywhere else. Not
that he would have much chance of seeing the man, not after ordering every last Maiden to defend the
tower.
But how to back down and retain a scrap of dignity after blustering left, right and center? “I’ve
decided I can do the most good from the tower,” he said, his face going hot.
“As the Car’a’carn commands,” Sulin replied without a hint of mockery, just as if it had been
his idea from the first. Lan nodded, then slipped away, the Maidens making narrow room for him.
The gap closed up right behind Lan, though, and when they began to move, Rand had no choice
except to go with them. He could have channeled, of course, flung Fire about or knocked them down
with Air, but that was hardly the way to behave with people on his side, let alone women. Besides, he
was not sure he could have made them leave him short of killing, and maybe not then. And anyway, he
had decided he was of most use at the tower, after all.
Egwene and Aviendha were as silent as Sulin as they walked, for which he was grateful. Of
course, at least part of their silence had to do with picking their way uphill and down in the dark
without breaking their necks. Aviendha did raise a mutter now and then that he barely caught,
something angry about skirts. But neither made fun of him for backing down so visibly. Though that
might well come later. Women seemed to enjoy jabbing the needle in just when you thought the danger
was past.
The sky began to lighten into gray, and as the log tower came into sight above the trees, he broke
the quiet himself. “I didn’t expect you to be part of this, Aviendha. I thought you said Wise Ones take
no part in battles.” He was sure she had. A Wise One could walk through the middle of a battle
untouched, or into any hold or stand of a clan that had blood feud with hers, but she took no part in
fighting, certainly not with channeling. Until he came to the Waste, even most Aiel had not really
known that some Wise Ones could channel, though there were rumors of strange abilities, and
sometimes something the Aiel thought might be close to channeling.
“I am not a Wise One yet,” she replied pleasantly, shifting her shawl. “If an Aes Sedai like
Egwene can do this, so can I. I arranged it this morning, while you still slept, but I have thought of it
since you first asked Egwene.”
There was enough light now for him to see Egwene flush. When she saw him glancing at her, she
tripped over nothing, and he had to catch her arm to keep her from falling. Avoiding his eyes, she
jerked free. Maybe he would not have to worry about any needles from her. They started uphill
through the sparse woods toward the tower.
“They didn’t try to stop you? Amys, I mean, or Bair, or Melaine?” He knew they had not. If they
had, she would not be there.
Aviendha shook her head, then frowned thoughtfully. “They talked for a long time with Sorilea,
then told me to do as I thought I must. Usually they tell me to do as they think I must.” Glancing at him
sideways, she added, “I heard Melaine say that you bring change to everything.”
“I do that,” he said, setting his foot on the bottom rung of the first ladder. “The Light help me,
that I do.”
The view from the platform was magnificent even to the naked eye, the land spreading out in
wooded hills. The trees were thick enough to hide the Aiel moving toward Cairhien—most would
already be in position—but dawn cast the city itself in golden light. A quick scan through one of the
looking glasses showed the barren hills along the river placid and seemingly empty of life. That
would change soon enough. The Shaido were there, if concealed for now. They would not remain

concealed when he began to direct. . . . What? Not balefire. Whatever he did, it had to unnerve the
Shaido as much as possible before his Aiel attacked.
Egwene and Aviendha had been taking turns looking through the other long tube, with pauses for
quiet discussion, but now they were simply talking softly. Exchanging nods finally, they moved closer
to the railing and stood with their hands on the rough-hewn timber, staring toward Cairhien. Goose
bumps suddenly dotted his skin. One of them was channeling, maybe both.
It was the wind that he noticed first, blowing toward the city. Not a breeze; the first real wind he
had felt in this country. And clouds were beginning to form above Cairhien, heaviest to the south,
growing thicker and blacker as he watched, roiling. Only there, over Cairhien and the Shaido.
Everywhere else as far as he could see, the sky was a clear blue, with only a few high thin white
wisps. Yet thunder rolled, long and solid. Suddenly lightning stabbed down, a jagged silver streak
that rent a hilltop below the city. Before the crack of the first bolt reached the tower, two more
crackled earthward. Wild forks danced across the sky, but those single lances of brilliant white struck
with the regularity of a heartbeat. Abruptly, ground exploded where no lightning had fallen,
fountaining fifty feet, then again somewhere else, and again.
Rand had no idea which woman was doing what, but they certainly looked set to harrow the
Shaido out. Time to do his bit, or stand watching. Reaching out, he seized saidin. Icy fire scoured the
outside of the Void that surrounded what was Rand al’Thor. Coldly, he ignored the oily filth seeping
into him from the taint, juggled wild torrents of the Power that threatened to engulf him.
At this distance, there were limits to what he could do. In fact, it was about as far as he could do
anything, really, without angreal or sa’angreal. Very likely that was why the women were channeling
one lightning bolt at a time, one explosion; if he was at his boundary, they must be stretching theirs.
A memory slid across the emptiness. Not his; Lews Therin’s. For once he did not care. In an
instant he channeled, and a ball of fire enveloped the top of a hill nearly five miles away, a churning
mass of pale yellow flame. When it faded, he could see without the looking glass that the hill was
lower now, and black at the crest, seemingly melted. Between the three of them, there might be no
need for the clans to fight Couladin at all.
Ilyena, my love, forgive me!
The Void trembled; for an instant Rand teetered on the brink of destruction. Waves of the One
Power crashed through him in a froth of fear; the taint seemed to solidify around his heart, a reeking
stone.
Clutching the rail until his knuckles ached, he forced himself back to calmness, forced the
emptiness to hold. Thereafter he refused to listen to the thoughts in his head. Instead he concentrated
everything on channeling, on methodically searing one hill after another.
Standing well back into what treeline there was on the crest, Mat held Pips’ nose under his arm
so the gelding would not whicker as he watched a thousand or so Aiel slanting toward him across the
hills from the south. The sun was just peeking over the horizon, stretching long rippling shadows to
one side of the trotting mass. The night’s warmth was already beginning to give way to the heat of
day. The air would swelter once the sun reached any height. He was already beginning to sweat.
The Aiel had not seen him yet, but he had few doubts that they would if he waited there much
longer. It hardly mattered that they very nearly had to be Rand’s men—if Couladin had men to the
south, the day was going to get very interesting for those stupid enough to be in the middle of the
fighting—hardly mattered because he was not going to run the risk of letting them see him. He had
already come too close to an arrow this morning for that kind of carelessness. Absently he fingered

the neat slice across the shoulder of his coat. Good shooting, at a moving target only half-seen through
trees. He could have admired it more had he not been the target.
Without taking his eyes from the approaching Aiel, he carefully backed Pips deeper into the
sparse thicket; if they saw him and picked up their pace, he wanted to know. People said Aiel could
run down a man on horseback, and he meant to have a good lead if they tried.
Not until the trees hid them from him did he quicken his own step, leading Pips onto the reverse
slope before mounting and turning west. A man could not be too careful if he wanted to stay alive on
this day and this ground. He muttered to himself as he rode, hat pulled low to shade his face and
black-hafted spear across his pommel. West. Again.
The day had begun so well, a good two hours before first light, when Melindhra had gone off to
some meeting of the Maidens. Thinking him asleep, she had not glanced at him as she stalked out
muttering half under her breath about Rand al’Thor and honor and “Far Dareis Mai above all.” She
sounded as if she were arguing with herself, but frankly, he did not care whether she wanted to pickle
Rand or stew him. Before she was a minute out of the tent, he was stuffing his saddlebags. No one had
so much as looked at him twice while he saddled Pips and ghosted away to the south. A good
beginning. Only he had not counted on columns of Taardad and Tomanelle and every other bloody
clan sweeping around to the south. No consolation that it was very close to what he had babbled to
Lan. He wanted to go south, and those Aiel had forced him toward the Alguenya. Toward where the
fighting would be.
A mile or two on, he cautiously turned Pips upslope, pausing deep in the scattered trees on the
crest. It was a higher hill than most, and he had a good view. This time there were no Aiel in sight,
but the column winding along the bottom of the twisting hill valley was almost as bad. Mounted
Tairens had the lead behind a knot of colorful lords’ banners, with a gap back to a thick, bristling
snake of pikemen in the Tairens’ dust, and then another to the Cairhienin horse, with their multitude of
banners and pennants and con. The Cairhienin maintained no order at all, milling about as lords
shifted back and forth for conversation, but at least they had flankers out to either side. In any case, as
soon as they were past, he had a clear route south. And I’ll not stop until I’m halfway to the bloody
Erinin!
A flicker of movement caught his eye, well ahead of the column below. He would not have seen
it except for being so high. None of the riders could have, certainly. Digging his small looking glass
from his saddlebags—Kin Tovere liked the dice—he peered toward what he had seen, and whistled
softly through his teeth. Aiel, at least as many as the men in the valley, and if they were not
Couladin’s, they meant to give a nameday surprise, for they were lying low among the dying bushes
and dead leaves.
For a moment he drummed fingers on his thigh. Shortly there were going to be some corpses
down there. And not many of them Aiel. None of my affair. I am out of this, out of here, and heading
south. He would wait a bit, then head off while they were all too busy to notice.
This fellow Weiramon—he had heard the gray beard’s name yesterday—was a stone fool. No
foreguard out, and no scouts, or he’d know what was bloody in store for him. For that matter, the
way the hills lay, the way the valley twisted, the Aiel could not see the column, either, only its thin
dust rising skyward. They certainly had had scouts to get themselves in place; they could not just be
waiting there on the off chance.
Idly whistling “Dance with Jak o’ the Shadows,” he put the looking glass back to his eye and
studied the hilltops. Yes. The Aiel commander had left a few men where they could signal a warning
just before the column entered the killing ground. But even they could not possibly see anything yet. In

a few minutes the first Tairens would come in sight, but until then . . .
It came as a shock when he heeled Pips to a gallop downslope. What under the Light am I
doing? Well, he could not just stand by and let them all go their deaths like geese to the knife. He
would warn them. That was all. Tell what lay in wait ahead, then he was gone.
The Cairhienin outriders saw him coming before he reached the bottom of the slope, of course,
heard Pips’ dead-flat charge. Two or three lowered their lances. Mat did not precisely enjoy having a
foot and a half of steel pointed at him, and still less three times over, but obviously one man was no
threat, even riding like a madman. They let him pass, and he swung in near the lead Cairhienin lords
long enough to shout, “Halt here! Now! By order of the Lord Dragon! Else he’ll channel your head
into your belly and feed you your own feet for breakfast!”
His heels dug in, and Pips sprang ahead. He only glanced back to be sure they were doing what
he said—they were, if showing some confusion over it; the hills hid them from the Aiel still, and once
their dust settled, the Aiel would have no way of knowing they were there—and then he was lying
low on the gelding’s neck, whipping Pips with his hat and galloping up alongside the infantry.
If I wait to let Weiramon pass the orders, it’ll be too late. That’s all. He would give his
warning and go.
The foot marched in blocks of two hundred or so pikemen, with one mounted officer in the front
of each and maybe fifty archers or crossbowmen at the rear. Most looked at him curiously as he
dashed by, Pips’ heels kicking up spurts of dust, but none broke stride. Some of the officers’ mounts
frisked as if the riders wanted to come see what had him in such a hurry, but none of them left their
places either. Good discipline. They would need it.
Defenders of the Stone brought up the tail end of the Tairens, in their breastplates and puffy
black-and-gold-striped coatsleeves, plumes of various colors on the rimmed helmets marking officers
and underofficers. The rest were armored the same, but bore the colors of various lords on their
sleeves. The silk-coated lords themselves rode at the very front in ornate breastplates and large white
plumes, their banners rippling behind them in a rising breeze toward the city.
Reining around in front of them so quickly that Pips danced, Mat shouted, “Halt, in the name of
the Lord Dragon!”
It seemed the fastest way to stop them, but for a moment he thought they meant to ride right over
him. Almost at the last moment, a young lord he remembered from outside Rand’s tent flung up a hand,
and then they were all drawing rein in a flurry of shouted orders that ran back along the column.
Weiramon was not there; not a lord was as much as ten years older than Mat.
“What is the meaning of this?” demanded the fellow who had signaled. Dark eyes glared
arrogantly down a sharp nose, chin lifted so his pointed beard looked ready to stab. Sweat trickling
down his face spoiled it only a little. “The Lord Dragon himself gave me this command. Who are you
to—?”
He cut off as another man Mat knew caught his sleeve, whispering urgently. Potato-faced Estean
looked haggard beneath his helmet as well as hot—the Aiel had wrung him out concerning conditions
in the city, so Mat had heard—but he had gambled at cards with Mat in Tear. He knew exactly who
Mat was. Estean’s breastplate alone had chips in the ornate gilding; none of the others had done more
than ride around looking pretty. Yet.
Sharp-nose’s chin came down as he listened, and when Estean left off, he spoke in a more
moderate tone. “No offense intended . . . ah . . . Lord Mat. I am Melanril, of House Asegora. How
may I serve the Lord Dragon?” Moderation slipped into actual hesitation at that last, and Estean broke
in anxiously.

“Why should we ‘halt’? I know the Lord Dragon told us to hold back, Mat, but burn my soul,
there’s no honor in sitting and letting the Aiel do all the fighting. Why should we be saddled with
chasing them after they’re broken? Besides, my father is in the city, and . . .” He trailed off under
Mat’s stare.
Mat shook his head, fanning himself with his hat. The fools were not even where they should be.
There was no chance of turning them back, either. If Melanril would go—and looking at him, Mat was
not sure he would, even on supposed orders from the Lord Dragon—there was still no chance. He sat
his saddle in plain sight of the Aiel lookouts. If the column started turning around, they would know
themselves discovered, and very likely they would attack while the Tairens and the Cairhienin pike
were tangled up. It would be a slaughter as surely as if they had gone ahead in ignorance.
“Where is Weiramon?”
“The Lord Dragon sent him back to Tear,” Melanril replied slowly. “To deal with the Illianer
pirates, and the bandits on the Plains of Maredo. He was reluctant to go, of course, even for so great a
responsibility, but . . . Pardon, Lord Mat, but if the Lord Dragon sent you, how is it that you don’t
know—”
Mat cut him off. “I am no lord. And if you want to question what Rand lets people know, ask
him.” That set the fellow back; he was not about to question the Lord bloody Dragon about anything.
Weiramon was a fool, but at least he was old enough to have been in a battle. Except for Estean,
looking like a sack of turnips tied on his horse, all this lot had seen was a tavern fight or two. And
maybe a few duels. Fat lot of good that would do them. “Now, you all listen to me. When you pass
through that gap ahead between the next two hills, Aiel are going to come down on you like an
avalanche.”
He might as well have told them there was going to be a ball, with the women all sighing to meet
a Tairen lordling. Eager grins broke out, and they started dancing their horses about, slapping each
other on the shoulder and boasting how many they would kill. Estean was odd man out, just sighing
and easing his sword in its scabbard.
“Don’t stare up there!” Mat snapped. The fools. In a minute they would be calling the charge!
“Keep your eyes on me. On me!”
It was who he was friends with that settled them down. Melanril and the others in their fine,
unmarked armor frowned impatiently, not understanding why he did not want to let them begin the
business of killing Aiel savages. If he had not been Rand’s friend they probably would have trampled
him and Pips both.
He could let them go charging off. They would do it piecemeal, leaving the pikes and the
Cairhienin horse behind, though the Cairhienin might join in once they realized what was happening.
And they would all die. The smart thing would be to let them get on with it while he headed in the
opposite direction. The only trouble was that once these idiots let the Aiel know they were
discovered, those Aiel might decide to do something fancy, like swinging around to take the strungout fools in the flank. If that happened, there was no certainty that he would get clear.
“What the Lord Dragon wants you to do,” he told them, “is to ride ahead slowly, just as if there
wasn’t an Aiel inside a hundred miles. As soon as the pikes are through the gap, they’ll form a hollow
square, and you get yourselves inside it double quick.”
“Inside!” Melanril protested. Angry mutters rose from the other young lords—except Estean,
who looked thoughtful. “There is no honor in hiding behind stinking—”
“You bloody do it,” Mat roared, reining Pips close to Melanril’s horse, “or if the bloody Aiel
don’t kill you, Rand will, and whatever he leaves, I’ll chop into sausage myself!” This was taking too

long; the Aiel had to be wondering what they were talking about by now. “With any luck, you will be
set before the Aiel can hit you. If you have horsebows, use them. Otherwise, hold tight. You’ll get
your bloody charge, and you’ll know when, but if you move too early . . . !” He could almost feel time
running down.
Setting the butt of his spear in his stirrup like a lance, he heeled Pips back down the column.
When he glanced over his shoulder, Melanril and the others were talking and peering after him. At
least they were not haring up the valley.
The commander of the pikemen proved to be a pale, slender Cairhienin, half a head shorter than
Mat and mounted on a gray gelding that looked past ready for the pasture. Daerid had hard eyes,
though, an oft-broken nose, and three white scars crisscrossing his face, one of them not very old. He
took off his bell-shaped helmet while he talked with Mat; the front of his head was shaved. No lord,
he. Maybe he had been part of the army, before the civil war started. Yes, his men knew how to form
a hedgehog. He had not faced Aiel, but he had faced brigands, and Andoran cavalry. There was an
implication that he had fought other Cairhienin as well, for one of the Houses contesting for the
throne. Daerid sounded neither eager nor reluctant; he sounded like a man with a job of work to do.
The column stepped off as Mat turned Pips’ head the other way. They marched with a measured
pace, and a quick look behind showed the Tairens’ horses moving no faster.
He let Pips go a little quicker than a walk, but not much. It seemed he could feel Aiel eyes on his
back, feel them wondering what he had said, and where he was going now and why. Just a messenger
who’s delivered his message and is going away. Nothing to worry about. He certainly hoped that
was what the Aiel thought, but his shoulders did not untense until he was sure they could no longer
see him.
The Cairhienin were still waiting where he had left them. They still had their flankers out, too.
Banners and con made a thicket where the lords had gathered, one in ten or better of the Cairhienin’s
number. Most of them wore plain breastplates, and where there was gilt or silverwork, it was
battered as though a drunken blacksmith had been at it. Some of their mounts made Daerid’s look like
Lan’s warhorse. Could they even do what was needed? But the faces that turned to him were hard, the
gazes harder.
He was in the clear, now, hidden from the Aiel. He could ride on. After telling this lot what was
expected of them, anyway. He had sent the others on into the Aiel trap; he could not simply abandon
them.
Talmanes of House Delovinde, his con three yellow stars on blue and his banner a black fox,
was even shorter than Daerid and had three years on Mat at most, but he led these Cairhienin although
there were older men and even gray hair present. His eyes held as little expression as Daerid’s, and
he looked like a coiled whip. His armor and sword were utterly plain. Once he had told Mat his name
the man listened quietly while Mat laid out his plan, leaning a little out of the saddle to cut lines in the
ground with the sword-bladed spear.
The other Cairhienin lords gathered round on their horses, watching, but none so sharply as
Talmanes. Talmanes studied the map he drew, and studied him from boots to hat, even his spear.
When he was done, the fellow still did not speak, until Mat barked, “Well? I don’t care whether you
take it or leave it, but your friends will be hip-deep in Aiel in not much longer.”
“The Tairens are no friends of mine. And Daerid is . . . useful. Certainly not a friend.” Dry
chuckles ran through the onlooking lords at the suggestion. “But I will lead one half, if you lead the
other.”
Talmanes pulled off one steel-backed gauntlet and put out his hand, but for a moment Mat only

stared at it. Lead? Him? I’m a gambler, not a soldier. A lover. Memories of battles long gone spun
through his head, but he forced them down. All he had to do was ride on. But then maybe Talmanes
would leave Estean and Daerid and the rest to roast. On the spit Mat had hung them from. Even so, it
was a surprise to him when he grasped the other’s hand and said, “You just be there when you’re
supposed to be.”
For reply Talmanes began calling off names in a quick voice. Lords and lordlings reined toward
Mat, each followed by a bannerman and perhaps a dozen retainers, until he had four hundred odd of
the Cairhienin. Talmanes did not have much to say after, either; he just led the remainder west at a
trot, trailing a faint cloud of dust.
“Keep together,” Mat told his half. “Charge when I say charge, run when I say run, and don’t
make any noise you don’t have to.” There was the creak of saddles and the thud of hooves as they
followed him, of course, but at least they did not talk, or ask questions.
A last glimpse of the other bristle of bright banners and con, and then a twist in the shallow
valley hid them. How had he gotten into this? It had all started so simply. Just give warning and go.
Each step after had seemed so small, so necessary. And now he had waded waist deep into the mud,
and no choice but to keep on. He hoped Talmanes meant to show up. The man had not even asked who
he was.
The hill valley twisted and forked as he angled north, but he had a good sense of direction. For
instance, he knew exactly which way lay south and safety, and it was not the way he was heading.
Dark clouds were forming up there toward the city, the first he had seen so thick in a long time. Rain
would break the drought—good for the farmers, if any remained—and settle the dust—good for
horsemen, so they did not announce themselves too early. Maybe if it rained, the Aiel would give up
and go home. The wind was beginning to pick up, too, bringing a little cool, for a wonder.
The sound of fighting drifted over the crests, men shouting, men screaming. It had begun.
Mat turned Pips, raised his spear and swung it right and left. He was almost surprised when the
Cairhienin formed into one long line to either side of him, facing upslope. The gesture had been
instinctive, from another time and place, but then, these men had seen fighting. He started Pips up
through the scattered trees at a slow walk, and they kept pace to the quiet jangle of bridles.
His first thought on reaching the height was relief at seeing Talmanes and his men coming into
sight on the crest across from him. His second was to curse.
Daerid had formed the hedgehog, spiny thickets of pikes four deep interspersed with bowmen to
make a large hollow square. Long pikes made it difficult for the Shaido to get close, however they
rushed in, and the archers and crossbowmen were exchanging shots hot and fast with the Aiel. Men
were falling on both sides, but the pikes simply closed in when one of their number went down,
making the square tighter. Of course, the Shaido did not appear to slacken their assault either.
The Defenders were dismounted in the center, and maybe half the Tairen lords with their
retainers. Half. That was what made him want to curse. The rest dashed about among the Aiel,
slashing and stabbing with sword and lance in knots of five or ten, or alone. Dozens of riderless
horses told how well they were doing. Melanril was off with only his bannerman, laying about with
his blade. Two Aiel darted in to neatly hamstring the lordling’s horse; it fell, head flailing—Mat was
sure it screamed, but the din swallowed it—and then Melanril vanished behind cadin’sor-clad
figures, spears stabbing. The bannerman lasted a moment longer.
Good riddance, Mat thought grimly. Standing in his stirrups, he raised the sword-bladed spear
high, then swept it forward, shouting, “Los! Los caba’drin!”
He would have had the words back if he could, and not because they were Old Tongue; it was a

boiling cauldron down in the valley. But whether or not any of the Cairhienin understood a command
of “horsemen forward” in the Old Tongue, they understood the gesture, especially when he dropped
back into his saddle and dug in his heels. Not that he really wanted to, but he could not see any choice
now. He had put those men down there—some might have gotten away if he had told them to turn and
run—and he just did not have a choice.
Banners and con waving, the Cairhienin charged downhill with him, shouting battle cries. In
imitation of him, no doubt, though what he was shouting was “Blood and bloody ashes!” Across the
valley, Talmanes raced down just as hard.
Sure that they had all the wetlanders penned, the Shaido never saw the others until crashed into
from behind on both sides. It was then that the lightning began to fall. And after that things really got
hairy.

CHAPTER
44
The Lesser Sadness

Rand’s shirt clung to him with the sweat of effort, but he kept his coat on for protection from
the wind gusting toward Cairhien. The sun had at least another hour to reach its noonday peak, yet
already he felt as if he had run all morning and been beaten with a club at the finish. Wrapped in the
Void, he was only distantly aware of the weariness, dimly perceiving the ache in arms and shoulders,
in the small of his back, a throb around the tender scar in his side. That he was aware of them at all
told the story. With the Power in him, he could make out individual leaves on the trees at a hundred
paces, but whatever happened to him physically should have been as if it were happening to someone
else.
He had long since taken to drawing on saidin through the angreal in his pocket, the stone carving
of the fat little man. Even so, working the Power was a strain now, weaving it at this distance of
miles, but only the rancid threads streaking what he drew kept him from pulling more, from trying to
pull it all to him. The Power was that sweet, taint or no. After hours of channeling without rest, he
was that tired. At the same time, he had to fight saidin itself harder, to put more of his strength into
keeping it from burning him to ash where he stood, from burning his mind to ash. It was ever more
difficult to hold off saidin’s destruction, more difficult to resist the desire to draw more, more
difficult to handle what he did draw. A nasty downward spiral, and hours to go before the battle was
decided.
Wiping sweat from his eyes, he gripped the platform’s rough railing. He was near the brink, yet
he was stronger than Egwene or Aviendha. The Aiel woman was standing, peering off toward
Cairhien and the storm clouds, occasionally bending to stare through the long looking glass; Egwene
sat cross-legged, leaning back against an upright still covered in gray bark, her eyes closed. They
both looked as worked out as he felt.
Before he could do anything—not that he knew what; he had no skill at Healing—Egwene’s eyes
opened, and she stood, exchanging a few quiet words with Aviendha that the wind snatched away
from even his saidin-enhanced hearing. Then Aviendha sat down in Egwene’s place and let her head
fall back against the upright. The black clouds around the city continued to stab lightning, but they
were wild forks far more often than single lances now.
So they were taking turns, giving each other a rest. It would have been nice to have someone do
that with him, but he did not regret telling Asmodean to stay in his tent. He would not have trusted him
to channel. Especially not now. Who could say what he would have done when he saw Rand
weakened as he was?
Staggering slightly, Rand pulled his looking glass around to study the hills outside the city. Life
was certainly visible there now. And death. Wherever he looked there was fighting, Aiel against
Aiel, a thousand here, five thousand there, swarming over the treeless hills and too closely meshed

for him to do anything. He could not find the column of horse and pike.
Three times he had seen them, once fighting twice their number of Aiel. He was certain they
were still out there. Small hope that Melanril had decided to obey his orders at this late juncture.
Choosing the man just because he had had the grace to be embarrassed by Weiramon’s behavior had
been a mistake, but there had been little time to make a choice, and he had had to get rid of Weiramon.
Nothing to be done about it now. Maybe one of the Cairhienin could be put in command. If even his
direct order would make the Tairens follow a Cairhienin.
A milling mass right at the city’s high gray wall caught his eye. Tall iron-bound gates stood
open, Aiel battling horsemen and spearmen almost in the open while folk tried to close the gates, tried
and failed because of the press of bodies. Horses with empty saddles and armored men unmoving on
the ground half a mile from the gate marked where the sortie had been driven back. Arrows rained
down from the walls, and head-sized chunks of rubble—even occasional spears slashing down with
enough force to spit two men, or three, though he still could not see from where exactly—but the Aiel
were going over their dead, ever closer to forcing their way in. A quick scan showed him two more
columns of Aiel trotting toward the gates, perhaps three thousand all told. He did not doubt that they
were Couladin’s as well.
He was aware of grinding his teeth. If the Shaido got inside Cairhien, he would never drive them
north. He would have to dig them out street by street; the cost in lives would dwarf the number of
those already dead, and the city itself would end a ruin like Eianrod, if not Taien. Cairhienin and
Shaido were mingled like ants in a bowl, but he had to do something.
Taking a deep breath, he channeled. The two women had set the conditions, bringing the storm
clouds; he did not need to be able to see their weavings to take advantage of them. Stark silver-blue
lightning struck into the Aiel, once, twice, again, as fast as a man could clap.
Rand jerked his head up, blinking away the burning lines that still seemed to cross his sight, and
when he looked through the long tube again, Shaido lay like cut barley all around where the bolts had
fallen. Men and horses thrashed on the ground closer to the gates, too, and some did not move at all,
but the uninjured were dragging the injured and the gates were beginning to close.
How many won’t make it back inside? How many of my own did I kill? The cold truth was that
it did not matter. It had had to be done, and it was done.
And well it was. Distantly he felt his knees wobbling. He would have to pace himself if he was
to last the rest of the day. No more laying about him everywhere; he had to spot where he was
particularly needed, where he could make a—
The storm clouds were massed only over the city and the hills to the south, but that did not stop
lightning from slashing out of the clear, cloudless sky above the tower, flashing down into the
gathered Maidens below with a deafening crack.
Hair lifting with the tingle in the air, Rand stared. He could feel that bolt in another way, feel the
weaving of saidin that had made it. So Asmodean was tempted even back in the tents.
There was no time for thought, though. Like rapid beats on a giant drum, bolt followed bolt,
marching through the Maidens until the last struck the base of the tower in an explosion of splinters
the size of arms and legs.
As the tower slowly began to slant over, Rand threw himself at Egwene and Aviendha.
Somehow he managed to scoop them both into one arm, then wrap the other around an upright on what
was now the upslope side of the platform. They stared at him wide-eyed, mouths coming open, but
there was no more time for speaking than for thinking. The shattered log tower toppled, crashing
through the branches of the trees. For an instant he believed they might cushion the fall.

With a snap, the upright he clung to broke off. The ground came up and knocked all the breath out
of him a heartbeat before the women came down on top of him. Darkness rolled in.
He regained consciousness slowly. Hearing returned first.
“. . . have dug us up like a boulder and sent us rolling downhill in the night.” It was Aviendha’s
voice, low, as if she spoke for her own ears. There was something moving on his face. “You have
taken away what we are, what we were. You must give us something in return, something to be. We
need you.” The moving thing slowed, touched more softly. “I need you. Not for myself, you will
understand. For Elayne. What is between her and me now is between her and me, but I will hand you
to her. I will. If you die, I will carry your corpse to her! If you die—!”
His eyes popped open, and for a moment they stared at each other almost nose to nose. Her hair
was all in disarray, her head scarf gone, and a purple lump marred her cheek. She straightened
jerkily, folding a damp cloth stained with blood, and began dabbing at his forehead with considerably
more force than before.
“I’ve no intention of dying,” he told her, though in truth he was not sure of that at all. The Void
and saidin were gone, of course. Just thinking of losing them as he had made him shiver; it was pure
luck that saidin had not scoured his mind blank in that last instant. Just thinking of seizing the Source
again made him groan. Without the Void for buffer, he felt every ache, every bruise and scrape, to the
fullest. He was so tired he could have dropped off to sleep at once if he had not hurt so much. As well
he did hurt, then, because he surely could not sleep. Not for a long time yet.
Sliding a hand beneath his coat, he touched his side, then surreptitiously wiped the blood off his
fingers onto his shirt before bringing the hand out again. No wonder that a fall like that had broken
open the half-healed, never-healed wound. He did not seem to be bleeding too badly, but if the
Maidens saw it, or Egwene, or even Aviendha, he might have a fight to keep from being hauled off to
Moiraine for Healing. He had too much to do yet for that—being Healed on top of everything else
would act on him like a cudgel to the temple—and besides, there must be far worse hurt than what he
suffered for her to deal with.
Grimacing, suppressing another groan, he got to his feet with only a little help from Aviendha.
And promptly forgot about his injuries.
Sulin sat on the ground nearby, with Egwene bandaging a bloody split in her scalp and muttering
fiercely at herself because she did not know how to Heal, but the white-haired Maiden was not the
only casualty, and not the worst by far. Everywhere cadin’sor-clad women were covering the dead
with blankets, and tending those who had merely been burned, if “merely” could be used for lightning
burns. Except for Egwene’s grumbling, the hilltop lay in near silence, even the injured women quiet
save for hoarse breathing.
The log tower, all but unrecognizable now, had not spared the Maidens in its fall, breaking arms
and legs, tearing open gashes. He watched as a blanket was laid over the face of a Maiden with redgold hair almost the shade of Elayne’s, head twisted at an unnatural angle and glazed eyes staring.
Jolien. One of those who first crossed the Dragonwall to search for He Who Comes With the Dawn.
She had gone to the Stone of Tear for him. And now she was dead. For him. Oh, you’ve done well at
keeping the Maidens from harm, he thought bitterly. Very well indeed.
He could still feel the lightning, or rather the residue of its making. Almost like the after-image
burned into his eyes earlier, he could trace the weave, though it was fading. To his surprise, it led
west, not back toward the tents. Not Asmodean, then.
“Sammael.” He was sure of it. Sammael had sent that attack in the Jangai, Sammael was behind
the pirates and the raids in Tear, and Sammael had done this. His lips peeled back in a snarl, and his

voice was a harsh whisper. “Sammael!” He did not realize he had taken a step until Aviendha seized
his arm.
A moment later, Egwene had the other, the pair of them clinging to him as if they meant to root
him to the spot. “Do not be a complete woolhead,” Egwene said, giving a start at his glare but not
letting go. She had redone the brown scarf around her head, but combing with her fingers had not put
her hair back in order, and dust still covered her blouse and skirt. “Whoever did this, why do you
think he waited so long, until you must be tired? Because if he missed killing you, and you went after
him, you would be easy meat. You can barely stand on your own!”
Aviendha was no readier to let go, meeting his stare with a flat one of her own. “You are needed
here, Rand al’Thor. Here, Car’a’carn. Does your honor lie with killing this man, or here with those
you have brought to this land?”
A young Aiel man came running up through the Maidens, shoufa around his shoulders, spears
and buckler swinging easily. If he thought it odd to find two women holding Rand between them, he
gave no hint of it. He eyed the shattered remnants of the tower and the dead and wounded with a slight
curiosity, as though wondering how it might have happened and where the enemy dead might be.
Grounding his spearpoints in front of Rand, he said, “I am Seirin, of the Shorara sept of the
Tomanelle.”
“I see you, Seirin,” Rand replied just as formally. Not easy with a pair of women holding him as
if they thought he might run.
“Han of the Tomanelle sends word to the Car’a’carn. The clans to the east are moving toward
each other. All four. Han means to join with Dhearic, and he has sent to Erim to join them.”
Rand drew a measured breath, and hoped the women thought his grimace was for the news; his
side burned, and he could feel blood spreading slowly down his shirt. So there would be nothing to
force Couladin north when the Shaido broke. If they broke; they had given no evidence of it yet that he
had seen. Why were the Miagoma and the others joining together? If they meant to come against him,
they were only giving warning. But if they meant to come against him, Han and Dhearic and Erim
would be outnumbered, and if the Shaido held long enough and the four clans broke through . . .
Across the wooded hills he could see that it had begun to rain over the city now that Egwene and
Aviendha were not holding the clouds. That would hamper both sides. Unless the women were in
better shape than they looked, they might be unable to regain control from this distance.
“Tell Han to do what he must to keep them off our backs.”
Young as he was—he was about Rand’s age, come to that—Seirin raised an eyebrow in
surprise. Of course. Han would not do differently, and Seirin knew it. He waited only long enough to
make certain that Rand had no further message; then he was off and running downhill, just as fast as he
had come. No doubt he hoped to get back without missing any more of the fighting than he had to. For
that matter, it might already have begun, there to the east.
“I need someone to fetch Jeade’en,” Rand said as soon as Seirin had dashed off. If he tried to
walk that far, he really would need the women to hold him up. The two of them looked nothing alike,
yet they managed practically identical suspicion. Those frowns must have been one of the things every
girl was taught by her mother. “I am not going after Sammael.” Not yet. “I have to get closer to the
city, though.” He nodded to the fallen tower; that was the only gesture available with them hanging on.
Master Tovere might be able to salvage the lenses from the looking glasses, but there were not three
logs of the tower unbroken. No more observing everything from on high today.
Egwene was plainly uncertain, but Aviendha barely paused before asking a young Maiden to go
to the gai’shain. To fetch Mist, too, which he had not counted on. Egwene began brushing herself off,

muttering under her breath at the dust, and Aviendha had found an ivory comb and another scarf
somewhere. Despite the fall, somehow they already looked considerably less disheveled than he.
Weariness still marked their faces, but as long as they could channel at all, they would be useful.
That gave him pause. Did he ever think of anyone now except as to how useful they were? He
should be able to keep them as safe as they had been atop the tower. Not that the tower had been very
safe, as it turned out, but this time he would manage things better.
Sulin stood as he approached, a pale cap of algode bandage covering the top of her head, her
hair a white fringe below.
“I am moving nearer the city,” he told her, “where I can see what is happening, and maybe do
something about it. Everyone who is injured is to remain here, along with enough others to protect
them if need be. Make it a strong guard, Sulin; I only need a handful with me, and it’s poor repayment
for the honor the Maidens have shown me if I let their wounded be slaughtered.” That should hold the
greater part of them away from the fighting. He himself would have to stay clear to keep the rest out,
but the way he felt, that would be no burden. “I want you to stay here, and—”
“I am not one of the injured,” she said stiffly, and he hesitated, then nodded slowly.
“Very well.” He had no doubt that her injury was serious, but neither did he doubt that she was
tough. And if she stayed, he might be stuck with someone like Enaila leading his guard. Being treated
like a brother was nowhere near as annoying as being treated like a son, and he was in no mood to put
up with the latter. “But I trust you to see that no one follows who is injured, Sulin. I will have to keep
moving. I can’t afford anyone who will slow me down or must be left behind.”
She nodded so quickly that he was convinced she would make any Maiden with as much as a
scratch remain behind. Except herself, of course. This was one time he felt no guilt over using
someone. The Maidens had chosen to carry the spear, but they had chosen to follow him, too. Maybe
“follow” was not precisely the word, considering some of the things they did, but that did not change
anything, to his mind. He would not, he could not, order a woman to her death, and that was that. In
truth, he had expected some sort of protest before this. He was only grateful that it had not come. I
must be more subtle than I think.
Two pale-robed gai’shain arrived leading Jeade’en and Mist, and behind them followed a
crowd of others, arms full of bandages and ointments and over their shoulders bulging water bags in
layers, under the direction of Sorilea and a dozen other Wise Ones whom he had met. At most he
thought he might know the names of half.
Sorilea was very definitely in charge, and she quickly had gai’shain and other Wise Ones alike
circulating among the Maidens tending wounds. She eyed Rand and Egwene and Aviendha, frowning
thoughtfully and pursing her thin lips, obviously thinking that all three looked tossed about enough to
need their injuries bathed. That look was enough to send Egwene scrambling into the gray’s saddle
with a smile and a nod for the aged Wise One, though if Aiel had been more familiar with riding,
Sorilea would have realized that Egwene’s awkward stiffness was not usual. And it was a measure of
Aviendha’s condition that she let Egwene pull her up behind the saddle without the slightest protest.
She smiled at Sorilea, too.
Gritting his teeth, Rand pulled himself into his own saddle in one smooth motion. Aching
muscles’ protests were buried under an avalanche of pain in his side, as though he had been stabbed
anew, and it took a full minute before he could breathe again, but he let none of it show.
Egwene reined Mist close to Jeade’en, near enough to whisper. “If you cannot mount a horse any
better than that, Rand al’Thor, maybe you should forget about riding at all for a while.” Aviendha
wore one of those blank Aiel expressions, but her eyes were intent on his face.

“I noticed you mounting, too,” he said quietly. “Maybe you ought to stay here and help Sorilea
until you feel better.” That shut her up, even if it did tighten her mouth sourly. Aviendha gave Sorilea
another smile; the old Wise One was still watching.
Rand booted the dapple to a trot downhill. Every step sent a jolt up his side that had him
breathing through his teeth, but he had ground to cover, and he could not do it at a walk. Besides,
Sorilea’s stare had been starting to get on his nerves.
Mist joined Jeade’en before he was fifty paces down the overgrown slope, and another fifty
brought Sulin and a stream of Maidens, some running to position themselves ahead. More than he had
hoped for, but it should not matter. What he had to do would not involve getting very close to the
fighting. They could stay back in safety with him.
Seizing saidin was an effort in and of itself, even through the angreal, and the sheer weight of it
seemed to press down on him greater than ever, the taint stronger. At least the Void shielded him from
his own pain. Somewhat, anyway. And if Sammael tried to play games with him again . . .
He quickened Jeade’en’s pace. Whatever Sammael did, he still had his own job to do.
Rain dripped from the brim of Mat’s hat, and periodically he had to lower his looking glass and
wipe off the end of the tube. The downpour had slackened in the last hour, but the sparse branches
overhead gave no shelter at all. His coat was long since soaked, and Pips’ ears were down; the horse
stood as if not intending to move however Mat thumped his heels.
He did not know for sure what time of day it was. Somewhere in the middle of the afternoon, he
thought, but the dark clouds had not thinned along with the rain, and they hid the sun where he was. On
the other hand, it felt very much like three or four days since he had ridden down to warn the Tairens.
He was still not sure why he had done that.
It was southward that he peered, and a way out that he looked for. A way out for three thousand
men; easily that many survived yet, though they had no idea what he was up to. They believed he was
hunting another fight for them, but three so far were three too many by his book. He thought he could
have escaped on his own, now, so long as he kept his eyes open and his wits about him. Three
thousand men, however, drew eyes whenever they moved, and they did not move quickly, what with
more than half their number afoot. That was why he was on this Light-forsaken hilltop, and why the
Tairens and Cairhienin were all jammed into the long, narrow hollow between this hill and the next.
If he simply made a break for it . . .
Jamming the looking glass back to his eye, he glared south at sparsely wooded hills. Here and
there were thickets, some fairly large, but most of the land was scrub or grass even here. He had
worked back to the east, using every fold in the ground that would hide a mouse, bringing the column
with him out of the treeless terrain and into some proper cover. Out of those bloody lightning strikes
and fireballs; he was not sure whether it was worse when they came, or when the earth simply
erupted in a roar for no apparent reason. All that effort to find that the battle was shifting with him. He
could not seem to get out of the center of the thing.
Where’s my bloody luck now that I really need it? He was a pea-brained fool for staying. Just
because he had managed to keep the others alive this long did not mean he could keep it up. Soon or
late, the dice would come up the Dark One’s Eyes. They’re the flaming soldiers. I should leave them
to it and ride.
But he kept searching, scanning the wooded peaks and ridges. They gave cover for Couladin’s
Aiel as well as for him, but here and there he could make them out. Not all were involved in pitched
battles, but every last group was larger than his, every one was between him and safety to the south,

and he had no way to tell who was who until it might be too late. The Aiel themselves seemed to
know at a glance, but that did him no good.
Some mile or more off, a few hundred cadin’sor-clad shapes running eight abreast and heading
east topped a rise where half-a-dozen leatherleaf made a poor excuse for a copse. Before the lead
runners could start down the other side, a lightning bolt flashed down into their midst, splashing men
and earth like a stone thrown into a pond. Pips did not even quiver as the clap reached Mat; the
gelding had grown accustomed to closer strikes than that.
Some of the fallen men picked themselves up, limping, and immediately joined those who had
kept their feet in a hasty check of the unmoving. No more than a dozen were hauled across shoulders
before they all dashed down from the height, back the way they had come. None paused to look at the
crater. Mat had watched them learn that lesson; waiting only invited a second silvery lance from the
clouds. In moments they were out of sight. Except for the dead.
He swung the looking glass east. There was a look of sunlight a few miles that way. The log
tower should have been visible, poking above the trees, but he had not been able to find it in some
time. Maybe he was looking in the wrong places. It did not matter. The lightning had to be Rand’s
work, and all the rest of it as well. If I can get far enough that way . . .
He would be right back where he started. Even if it was not the pull of ta’veren drawing him
back, he would have a hard time leaving again once Moiraine found out. And there was Melindhra to
consider. He had never heard of a woman who would not take it askance when a man tried to walk
out of her life without letting her know.
As he panned the looking glass slowly, hunting the tower, a slope covered in spaced leatherleaf
and paperbark abruptly went up in flames, every tree became a torch at the same instant.
Slowly he lowered the brass-bound tube; he hardly required it to see the fire, and the thick gray
smoke already making a thick plume into the sky. He did not need signs to recognize channeling when
he saw it, not like that. Had Rand finally tipped over the edge of madness? Or maybe Aviendha had
finally had enough of being forced to stay around him. Never upset a woman who could channel; that
was a rule Mat seldom managed to follow, but he did try.
Save the smart mouth for somebody besides yourself, he thought sourly. He was just trying not
to think about the third alternative. If Rand had not finally gone mad, and Aviendha or Egwene or one
of the Wise Ones had not decided to be rid of him, then someone else was taking a hand in the day’s
business. He could add two twos without getting five. Sammael. So much for trying that way out; it
was no way out of anything. Blood and bloody ashes! What has happened to my—?
A fallen branch cracked under someone’s foot behind him, and he reacted without thinking,
knees more than reins pulling Pips in a tight circle, sword-bladed spear whipping across from the
pommel of his saddle.
Estean almost dropped his helmet, his eyes going wide, as the short blade stopped a breath short
of splitting his head for him. The rain had slicked his hair down into his face. Also afoot, Nalesean
grinned, partly startled and partly amused at the other young Tairen’s discomfort. Square-faced and
blocky, Nalesean was the second since Melanril to lead the Tairen cavalry. Talmanes and Daerid
were there as well, a pace behind as usual, and blank-faced beneath their bell-shaped helmets, also
as usual. The four had left their horses farther back in the trees.
“There are Aiel coming straight for us, Mat,” Nalesean said as Mat raised the raven-marked
spear upright. “The Light burn my soul if there’s a one less than five thousand.” He grinned at that,
too. “I don’t think they know we’re here waiting for them.”
Estean nodded once. “They are keeping to the valleys and hollows. Hiding from . . .” He glanced

at the clouds and shivered. He was not the only one to be uneasy about what might come out of the
sky; the other three looked up, too. “Anyway, it’s plain they mean to go through where Daerid’s men
are.” There was actually a touch of respect in his voice when he mentioned the pikes. Grudging, true,
and not very strong, but it was difficult to look down on someone after they had saved your neck a
few times. “They will be on top of us before they see us.”
“Wonderful.” Mat breathed. “That is just bloody wonderful.”
He meant it for sarcasm, yet Nalesean and Estean missed the flavor, of course. They looked
eager. But Daerid wore as much expression on his scarred face as a rock, and Talmanes lifted an
eyebrow at Mat just a fraction, shook his head a hair. That pair knew fighting.
The first encounter with the Shaido had been an even wager at best, one Mat would never have
taken if not forced. That all the lightning had shaken the Aiel enough to turn it into a rout changed
nothing. Twice more today they had seen action, when Mat discovered himself in a choice of whether
to catch or be caught, and neither had come out nearly as well as the Tairens believed. One had been
a draw, but only because he had been able to lose the Shaido after they pulled back to regroup. At
least they had not come again while he was getting everyone away through the twisting hill valleys.
He suspected they had found something else to occupy them; maybe more of that lightning, or
fireballs, or the Light knew what. He knew very well what had allowed them to escape their last fight
with skins mostly whole. Another bunch of Aiel plowing into the rear of those fighting him, just in
time to keep the pikes from being overrun. The Shaido had decided to withdraw to the north, and the
others—he still did not know who—had swung off to the west, leaving him in possession of the field.
Nalesean and Estean considered it a clear victory. Daerid and Talmanes knew better.
“How long?” Mat asked.
It was Talmanes who answered. “Half an hour. Perhaps a little more, if grace favors us.” The
Tairens looked doubtful; they still did not seem to realize how quickly Aiel could move.
Mat had no such illusions. He had already studied the surrounding terrain, but he looked at it
again and sighed. There was a very good view from this hill, and the only halfway decent stand of
trees within half a mile was right where he sat his saddle. The rest was scrub brush, little as much as
waist-high, dotted with leatherleaf and paperbark and the occasional oak. Those Aiel would surely
send scouts up here for a look, and there was no chance at all that even the horsemen could get out of
sight before they did. The pikes would be right out in the open. He knew what had to be done—it was
catch or be caught again—but he did not have to like it.
He only took a glance, but before he could open his mouth, Daerid said, “My scouts tell me
Couladin himself is with this lot. At least, their leader has his arms bare, and shows marks such as the
Lord Dragon is said to carry.”
Mat grunted. Couladin, and heading east. If there was any way to step aside, the fellow would
run headlong into Rand. That might even be what he was after. Mat realized that he was smoldering,
and it had nothing to do with Couladin wanting to kill Rand. The Shaido chief, or whatever the man
was, might remember Mat vaguely as somebody hanging about Rand, but Couladin was the reason he
was stuck out here in the middle of a battle, trying to stay alive, wondering whether any minute it was
going to turn into a personal fight between Rand and Sammael, the kind of fight that might kill
everything within two or three miles. That’s if I don’t get a spear through the brisket first. And no
more choice about it than had a goose hanging outside the kitchen door. None of it would be so
without Couladin.
A pity no one had killed the man years ago. He certainly gave excuses enough. Aiel seldom let
anger show, and when they did, it was cold and tight. Couladin, on the other hand, seemed to flare up

two or three times a day, losing his head in a fiery rage as quick as snap a straw. A miracle he was
still alive, and the Dark One’s own luck.
“Nalesean,” Mat said angrily, “swing your Tairens wide to the north and come in on these
fellows from behind. We will be holding their attention, so you ride hard and come down like a barn
collapsing.” So he has the Dark One’s luck, does he? Blood and ashes, but I hope mine is back in.
“Talmanes, you do the same to the south. Move, both of you. We’ve little time, and it’s wasting.”
The two Tairens bowed hastily and dashed for their horses, clapping on their helmets.
Talmanes’ bow was more formal. “Grace favor your sword, Mat. Or perhaps I should say your
spear.” Then he was gone, too.
Looking up at Mat as the three vanished down the hill, Daerid slashed rain from his eyes with a
finger. “So you will stay with the pikes this time. You must not let your anger at this Couladin
overcome you. A battle is no place to try fighting a duel.”
Mat barely stopped from gaping. A duel? Him? With Couladin? Was that why Daerid thought he
was staying with the foot? He had chosen it because it was safer to be behind the pikes. That was his
reason. The whole reason. “Not to worry. I can hold myself in rein.” And he had thought Daerid the
most sensible of the whole lot.
The Cairhienin merely nodded. “I thought that you could. You have seen pikes pushed before,
and faced a charge or two, I vow. Talmanes gives praises when there are two moons, yet I heard him
say aloud that he would follow wherever you led. Some day I would like to hear your story,
Andorman. But you are young—under the Light, I mean no disrespect—and young men have hot
blood.”
“This rain will keep it cool if nothing else does.” Blood and ashes! Were they all mad?
Talmanes was praising him? He wondered what they would say if they found out he was only a
gambler following bits of memory from men dead a thousand years and more. They would be drawing
lots for first chance to spit him like a pig. The lords especially; no one liked being made to look a
fool, but nobles seemed to like it least of all, perhaps because they so often managed it on their own.
Well, one way or another, he meant to be miles away when that discovery came. Bloody Couladin.
I’d like to shove this spear down his throat! Heeling Pips, he started for the opposite slope, where
the foot waited below.
Daerid climbed into his own saddle and swung in beside him, nodding as Mat spun out his plan.
The bowmen on the slopes, where they could cover the flanks, but lying down, hidden in the brush
until the last minute. One man on the crest to signal the Aiel in sight. And the pikes to step off as soon
as he did, marching straight out toward the approaching enemy. “As soon as we can see the Shaido,
we’ll retreat just as fast as we can, almost back to the gap between these two hills, then turn to face
them.”
“They will think we wanted to run, realized we could not, and turned at bay like a bear to the
hounds. Seeing us less than half their number and fighting only because we must, they should think to
roll over us. Can we but hold their attention until the horse comes down on them from behind . . .”
The Cairhienin actually grinned. “It is using the Aiel’s own tactics against them.”
“We had better hold their bloody attention.” Mat’s tone was as dry as he was wet. “To make
sure we do—to make sure they don’t start putting loops around our flanks—I want a cry raised as
soon as you stop the retreat. ‘Protect the Lord Dragon.’ ” This time Daerid laughed aloud.
That should bring the Shaido in right enough, especially if Couladin was leading. If Couladin
really was leading, if he thought Rand was with the pikes, if the pikes could hold until the horse
arrived . . . A lot of ifs. Mat could hear those dice rolling in his head again. This was the biggest

gamble he had ever taken in his life. He wondered how long it was until nightfall; a man should be
able to make his way out in the night. He wished those dice would get out of his head, or else fall so
he knew what they showed. Scowling into the rain, he booted Pips on down the hillside.
Jeade’en stopped on a crest where a dozen trees made a thin topknot, and Rand hunched slightly
against the pain in his side. The crescent moon, riding high, cast a pale light, yet even to his saidinamplified vision anything more than a hundred paces distant was featureless shadow. Night
swallowed the surrounding hills whole, and he was only intermittently aware of Sulin hovering
nearby, and Maidens all around him. But then, he could not seem to keep his eyes more than half open;
they felt grainy, and he thought the gnawing pain in his side might be all that held him awake. He did
not think of it often. Thought was not only distant now, it was slow.
Was it twice Sammael had attempted his life today, or three times? More? It seemed that he
should be able to remember how often someone had tried to kill him. No, not to kill. To bait. Are you
still so jealous of me, Tel Janin? When did I ever slight you, or give you one finger less than your
due?
Swaying, Rand scrubbed a hand through his hair. There had been something odd about that
thought, but he could not recall what. Sammael. . . . No. He could deal with him when . . . if . . . No
matter. Later. Today Sammael was only a distraction from what was important. He might even be
gone.
Vaguely it seemed that there had been no attack after . . . After what? He recalled countering
Sammael’s last move with something particularly nasty, but he could not pull the memory to the
surface. Not balefire. Mustn’t use that. Threatens the fabric of the Pattern. Not even for Ilyena? I
would burn the world and use my soul for tinder to hear her laugh again.
He was drifting again, away from what was important.
However long ago the sun had gone down, it had sunk on fighting, lengthening shadows gradually
overwhelming the golden-red light, the men killing and dying. Now, vagrant winds still brought
distant shouts and screams. Because of Couladin, true, but at the heart of it, because of himself.
For a moment he could not remember his name.
“Rand al’Thor,” he said aloud, and shivered, though his coat was damp with sweat. For an
instant, that name had sounded strange to him. “I am Rand al’Thor, and I need to . . . I need to see.”
He had not eaten since morning, but then, the taint on saidin drove hunger away. The Void
quivered constantly, and he hung on to the True Source by his fingernails. It was like riding a bull
driven mad by redwort, or swimming naked in a river of fire churned to rapids by jagged boulders of
ice. Yet when he was not on the brink of being gored or battered or drowned, it seemed that saidin
was the only strength left in him. Saidin was there, filing at the edges of him, trying to erode or
corrode his mind, but ready to be used.
With a jerky nod, he channeled, and something burned high in the sky. Something. A ball of
bubbling blue flame that banished shadows in harsh light.
Hills mounded up all around, trees black in the stark illumination. Nothing moved. A faint sound
came to him on a gust of wind. Cheering perhaps, or singing. Or maybe he was imagining things; it
was so tiny, he could well have been, and it died with the wind.
Suddenly he became aware of the Maidens around him, hundreds of them. Some, including Sulin,
were staring at him, but many had their eyes squeezed shut. It took him a moment to realize they were
trying to preserve night vision. He frowned, searching. Egwene and Aviendha were no longer there.
Another long moment passed before he remembered to loose the weave of his channeling and let

blackness reclaim the night. A deep blackness to his eyes, now.
“Where are they?” He was vaguely irritated when he had to say who he meant, and just as
vaguely aware that he had no reason for it.
“They went to Moiraine Sedai and the Wise Ones at dusk, Car’a’carn,” Sulin replied, moving
closer to Jeade’en. Her short white hair shone in the moonlight. No, her head was bandaged. How
could he have forgotten? “A good two hours gone. They know that flesh is not stone. Even the
strongest legs can run only so far.”
Rand frowned. Legs? They had been riding Mist. The woman was making no sense. “I have to
find them.”
“They are with Moiraine Sedai and the Wise Ones, Car’a’carn,” she said slowly. He thought
she was frowning, too, but it was hard to be sure.
“Not them,” he muttered. “Have to find my people. They’re still out there, Sulin.” Why was the
stallion not moving? “Can you hear them? Out there, in the night. Still fighting. I need to help them.”
Of course; he had to dig his heels into the dapple’s ribs. But when he did, Jaede’en only shifted
sideways, with Sulin holding on to his bridle. He did not remember that she had been holding the
bridle.
“The Wise Ones must speak to you now, Rand al’Thor.” Her voice had changed, but he was too
weary to say how.
“Can’t it wait?” He must have missed the runner with the message. “I must find them, Sulin.”
Enaila seemed to spring up on the other side of the stallion’s head. “You have found your
people, Rand al’Thor.”
“The Wise Ones are waiting for you,” Sulin added. She and Enaila turned Jeade’en without
waiting on his agreement. Maidens crowded in for some reason as they started along a winding way
down the side of the hill, faces reflecting moonlight as they stared up at him, so close their shoulders
brushed the horse’s flanks.
“Whatever they want,” he grumbled, “they had best be quick.” There was no need for them to be
leading the dapple, but it was too much effort to make a fuss over it. He twisted to look back, grunting
at the pain in his side; the crest was already swallowed in the night. “I have a lot to do yet. I need to
find . . .” Couladin. Sammael. The men who were fighting and dying for him. “I need to find them.”
He was so tired, but he could not sleep yet.
Lamps on poles lit the Wise Ones’ encampment, and small fires where kettles of water were
hauled away and replaced by white-robed men and women as soon as they began boiling. Gai’shain
scurried everywhere, and Wise Ones as well, tending the wounded whose numbers swelled the camp.
Moiraine was moving slowly down the long lines of those who could not stand, only rarely pausing to
lay hands on an Aiel who then thrashed in the throes of being Healed. She swayed whenever she
straightened, and Lan hovered behind her as if wanting to hold her up, or expecting to have to. Sulin
exchanged words with Adelin and Enaila, too low for Rand to make out, and the younger women ran
to speak to the Aes Sedai.
Despite the numbers of wounded, not all of the Wise Ones were looking after them. Inside a
pavilion off to one side, perhaps twenty sat in a circle listening to one standing in the center. When
she sat, another took her place. Gai’shain knelt around the outside of the pavilion, but none of the
Wise Ones appeared to have any interest in wine, or anything except what they were hearing. Rand
thought the speaker was Amys.
To his surprise, Asmodean was also helping out with the wounded, the water bag hanging from
each shoulder looking decidedly odd with his dark velvet coat and white lace. Straightening from

giving a drink to a man stripped to the waist except for bandages, he saw Rand and hesitated.
After a moment he handed the water bags to one of the gai’shain and wove his way through the
Maidens toward Rand. They ignored him—they all seemed to be watching Adelin and Enaila
speaking to Moiraine or else eyeing Rand—and his face was tight by the time he had to pause for the
solid circle of Far Dareis Mai around Jeade’en. They were slow in parting, and did so just enough to
let him through to Rand’s stirrup.
“I was sure you must be safe. I was sure.” From his tone of voice, he had been no such thing.
When Rand did not speak, Asmodean shrugged uncomfortably. “Moiraine insisted I carry water. A
forceful woman, to not allow the Lord Dragon’s bard to . . .” Trailing off, he licked his lips quickly.
“What happened?”
“Sammael,” Rand said, but not in answer. He was just speaking the thoughts that drifted through
the Void. “I remember when he was first named Destroyer of Hope. After he betrayed the Gates of
Hevan, and carried the Shadow down into the Rorn M’doi and the heart of Satelle. Hope did seem to
die that day, Culan Cuhan wept. What is wrong?” Asmodean’s face had gone as white as Sulin’s hair;
he only shook his head mutely. Rand peered at the pavilion. Whoever was speaking now, he did not
know her. “Is that where they are waiting for me? Then I should join them.”
“They will not welcome you yet,” Lan said, appearing beside Asmodean, who jumped, “or any
man.” Rand had not heard or seen the Warder approach either, but he only turned his head. Even that
seemed an effort. It seemed to be someone else’s head. “They meet with Wise Ones from the
Miagoma, the Codarra, the Shiande and the Daryne.”
“The clans are coming to me,” Rand said flatly. But they had waited long enough to make today
bloodier. It never happened like that in the stories.
“So it seems. But the four chiefs will not meet you until the Wise Ones have made their
arrangements,” Lan added dryly. “Come. Moiraine can tell you more than I of it.”
Rand shook his head. “Done is done. I can hear details later. If Han doesn’t need to keep them
from our backs any longer, then I need him. Sulin, send a runner. Han—”
“It is done, Rand,” the Warder said insistently. “All of it. Only a few Shaido remain south of the
city. Thousands have been taken prisoner, and most of the rest are crossing the Gaelin. Word would
have been sent to you an hour ago, had anyone known where you were. You’ve kept moving. Come
and let Moiraine tell you.”
“Done? We’ve won?”
“You have won. Completely.”
Rand peered at the men being bandaged, the patient lines awaiting bandages and those leaving
with them. The rows that lay almost unmoving. Moiraine was still making her way along those,
pausing wearily here and there to Heal. Only a few of the wounded would be here, of course. They
would have been coming as they could throughout the day, leaving as and when they could. If they
could. None of the dead would be here. Only a battle lost is sadder than a battle won. He seemed to
remember saying that before, long ago. Perhaps he had read it.
No. There were too many living in his responsibility for him to worry over the dead. But how
many faces will I know, like Jolien’s? I will never forget Ilyena, not if all the world burns!
Frowning, he raised a hand to his head. Those thoughts had seemed to come on top of one
another, from different places. He was so tired he could hardly think. But he needed to, needed
thoughts that did not slide by almost beyond his reach. He released the Source and the Void, and
convulsed as saidin almost drove him under in that moment of retreat. He barely had time to realize
his mistake. With the Power gone, exhaustion and pain crashed down on him.

He was aware of faces turned up to him as he toppled from his saddle, mouths moving, hands
reaching to grab him, cushion his fall.
“Moiraine!” Lan shouted, voice hollow in Rand’s ears. “He is bleeding badly!”
Sulin had his head cradled in her arms. “Hold on, Rand al’Thor,” she said urgently. “Hold on.”
Asmodean said nothing, but his face was bleak, and Rand felt a trickle of saidin flowing into
him from the man. Darkness came.

CHAPTER

After the Storm

Sitting on a small boulder jutting from the foot of the slope, Mat winced as he pulled his broadbrimmed hat lower against the midmorning sun. Partly to shield his eyes from the sun. There was
another thing he did not want to see, though cuts and bruises reminded him, especially the arrow slash
along his temple that the hat pressed against. An ointment from Daerid’s saddlebags had stopped the
bleeding, there and elsewhere, yet everything still hurt, and most of it stung. That part would grow
worse. The heat of the day was just beginning to take hold, but sweat was beading up on his face and
already dampening his smallclothes and shirt. Idly he wondered whether autumn would ever come to
Cairhien. At least discomfort kept him from thinking how tired he was; even after a night with no
sleep he would have lain awake in a feather bed, much less blankets on the ground. Not that he
wanted to be anywhere near his tent in any case.
A fine bloody to-do. Nearly killed, I’m sweating like a pig, I can’t find a comfortable place to
stretch out, and I don’t dare get drunk. Blood and bloody ashes! He stopped fingering a slice across
the chest of his coat—an inch difference, and that spear would have gone through his heart; Light, but
the man had been good!—and put that part of it out of his mind. Not that it was easy, with what was
going on all around him.
For once the Tairens and Cairhienin did not seem to mind seeing Aiel tents in every direction.
There were even Aiel right in the camp, and almost as miraculously, Tairens mingling with
Cairhienin among the smoky cook-fires. Not that anyone was eating; the kettles had not been set on the
fires, although he could smell meat burning somewhere. Instead, most were as drunk as they could
manage on wine, brandy, or Aiel oosquai, laughing and celebrating. Not far from where he sat, a
dozen Defenders of the Stone, stripped to sweaty shirtsleeves, were dancing to the claps of ten times
as many watchers. In a line, with arms around each others’ shoulders, they stepped so quickly that it
was a wonder none of them tripped or kicked the man next to them. For another circle of onlookers,
near a ten-foot pole stuck in the ground—Mat hastily averted his eyes—as many Aielmen were doing
some kicking of their own. Mat assumed it was a dance; another Aiel was playing the pipes for them.
They leaped as high as they could, flung one foot even higher, then landed on that foot and
immediately leaped upward again, faster and faster, sometimes spinning like horizontal tops at the
height of their leaps, or turning somersaults or backflips. Seven or eight Tairens and Cairhienin sat
nursing broken bones from trying it, all the while cheering and laughing like madmen, passing a stone
crock of something back and forth. In other places other men were dancing, and maybe singing. It was
hard to say, in the din. Without stirring, he could count ten flutes, not to mention twice as many tin
whistles, and a skinny Cairhienin in a ragged coat was blowing something that looked part flute and
part horn with some odd bits tossed in. And there were countless drums, most of them pots being

banged with spoons.
In short, the camp was bedlam and a ball rolled into one. He recognized it, mainly from those
memories he could still assign to other men if he concentrated hard enough. A celebration of still
being alive. One more time they had walked under the Dark One’s nose and survived to tell the tale.
One more dance along the razor’s edge finished. Almost dead yesterday, maybe dead tomorrow, but
alive, gloriously alive, today. He did not feel like celebrating. What good was being alive if it meant
living in a cage?
He shook his head as Daerid, Estean and a heavyset red-haired Aiel man he did not know
staggered by, holding each other up. Barely audible through the clamor, Daerid and Estean were
trying to teach the taller man between them the words to “Dance with Jak o’ the Shadows.”
“We’ll sing all night, and drink all day,
and on the girls we’ll spend our pay,
and when it’s gone, then we’ll away,
to dance with Jak o’ the Shadows.”
The sun-dark fellow showed no interest in learning, of course—he would not unless they
convinced him it was a proper battle hymn—but he listened, and he was not the only one. By the time
the three passed out of sight in the milling crowd, they had acquired a tail of twenty more, waving
dented pewter cups and tarred-leather mugs, all bellowing the tune at the top of their lungs.
“There’re some delight in ale and wine,
and some in girls with ankles fine,
but my delight, yes, always mine,
is to dance with Jak o’ the Shadows.”
Mat wished he had never taught any of them the song. The teaching had just kept his mind
occupied while Daerid stopped him from bleeding to death; that ointment stung as bad as the gashes
themselves had, and Daerid would never make a seamstress jealous with his delicate handling of
needle and thread. Only, the song had spread from that first dozen like fire in dry grass. Tairens and
Cairhienin, horse and foot, had all been singing it when they returned at dawn.
Returned. Right back to the hill valley where they had started, below the ruin of the log tower,
and no chance for him to get away. He had offered to ride ahead, and Talmanes and Nalesean nearly
came to blows over who was to provide his escort. Not everyone had become the best of friends. All
he needed now was for Moiraine to come asking questions about where he had been and why,
nattering at him about ta’veren and duty, about the Pattern and Tarmon Gai’don, until his head spun.
Doubtless she was with Rand now, but she would get around to him eventually.
He glanced up at the hilltop and the tangle of shattered logs among broken trees. That Cairhienin
fellow who had made the looking glasses for Rand was up there with his apprentices, poking about.
The Aiel had been full of what happened there. It was definitely past time for him to be gone. The
foxhead medallion protected him from women channeling, but he had heard enough from Rand to
know a man’s channeling was different. He had no interest in finding out whether the thing would
shield him from Sammael and his ilk.
Grimacing at darts of pain, he used the black-hafted spear to lever himself to his feet. Around
him the celebration went on. If he drifted down to the picket lines now . . . He was not looking
forward to saddling Pips.
“The hero should not sit without drinking.”
Startled, he jerked around, grunting at the stab of his wounds, to stare at Melindhra. She had a
large clay pitcher in one hand, not spears, and her face was not veiled, but her eyes seemed to be

weighing him. “Now listen, Melindhra, I can explain everything.”
“What must be explained?” she asked, flinging her free arm around his shoulders. Even with the
sudden jolt, he tried to stand straighter; he still was not used to having to look up at a woman. “I knew
you would seek your own honor. The Car’a’carn casts a great shadow, but no man wishes to spend
his life in the shade.”
Closing his mouth hurriedly, he managed a faint, “Of course.” She was not going to try to kill
him. “That’s it exactly.” In his relief, he took the pitcher from her, but his gulp turned into a splutter. It
was the rawest double-distilled brandy he had ever tasted.
She retrieved the pitcher long enough to take a draw, then sighed gratefully and pushed it back at
him. “He was a man of much honor, Mat Cauthon. Better that you had captured him, but even by
killing him, you have gained much ji. It was well that you sought him out.”
Despite himself, Mat looked at what he had been avoiding, and shivered. A leather cord tied in
short flame-red hair held Couladin’s head atop the ten-foot pole near where the Aielmen were
dancing. The thing seemed to be grinning. At him.
Sought Couladin out? He had done his best to keep the pikes between him and any of the Shaido.
But that arrow had clipped the side of his head, and he was on the ground before he knew it,
struggling to get to his feet with the fight raging all around him, laying about him with the ravenmarked spear, trying to make it back to Pips. Couladin had appeared as if springing out of air, veiled
for killing, but there had been no mistaking those bare arms, entwined with Dragons glittering goldand-red. The man had been cutting a swath into the pikemen with his spears, shouting for Rand to
show himself, shouting that he was the true Car’a’carn. Maybe he really believed it by then. Mat still
did not know whether Couladin had recognized him, but it had made no difference, not when the
fellow decided to carve a hole through him to find Rand. He did not know who had cut off Couladin’s
head afterward, either.
I was too busy trying to stay alive to watch, he thought sourly. And hoping he would not bleed
to death. Back in the Two Rivers he had been as fine a hand with a quarterstaff as anyone, and a
quarterstaff was not so different from a spear, but Couladin must have been born with the things in his
hands. Of course, that skill had not availed the man much in the end. Maybe I still have a little bit of
luck. Please, Light, let it show itself now!
He was thinking of how to get rid of Melindhra so he could saddle Pips when Talmanes
presented himself with a formal bow, hand to heart in the Cairhienin fashion. “Grace favor you, Mat.”
“And you,” Mat said absently. She was not going to go because he asked. Asking would
certainly put a fox in the henyard. Maybe if he told her he wanted to take a ride. They said Aiel could
run down horses.
“A delegation came from the city during the night. There will be a triumphal procession for the
Lord Dragon, in gratitude from Cairhien.”
“Will there?” She had to have duties of some sort. The Maidens were always flocking around
Rand; maybe she would be called off for that. Glancing at her though, he did not think he had better
count on it. Her wide smile was . . . proprietary.
“The delegation was from the High Lord Meilan,” Nalesean said, joining them. His bow was
just as correct, both hands sweeping wide, but hasty. “It is he who offers the procession to the Lord
Dragon.”
“Lord Dobraine, Lord Maringil and Lady Colavaere, among others, also came to the Lord
Dragon.”
Mat pulled his mind back to the moment. Each of the pair was trying to pretend the other of them

did not exist—both looking right at him, with never the flicker of an eye toward each other—but their
faces were as tight as their voices from the strain, their hands white-knuckled on sword hilts. It would
be a cap to everything if they came to blows, and him likely still trying to hobble out of reach when
one of them ran him through by accident. “What does it matter who sent a delegation, as long as Rand
gets his procession?”
“It matters that you should ask him for our rightful place at the head,” Talmanes said quickly.
“You slew Couladin, and earned us that place.” Nalesean closed his mouth and scowled; plainly he
had been about to say the same thing.
“You two ask him,” Mat said. “It’s none of my affair.” Melindhra’s hand tightened on the back of
his neck, but he did not care. Moiraine would surely not be far from Rand. He was not about to put his
neck in a second noose while still trying to think his way out of the first.
Talmanes and Nalesean gaped at him as if he were demented. “You are our battle leader,”
Nalesean protested. “Our general.”
“My bodyservant will polish your boots,” Talmanes put in with a small smile that he carefully
did not direct at the square-faced Tairen, “and brush and mend your clothes. So you will appear at
your best.”
Nalesean gave his oiled beard a jerk; his eyes darted halfway to the other man before he could
stop them. “If I may offer, I have a good coat I think will fit you well. Gold satin and crimson.” It was
the Cairhienin’s turn to glower.
“General!” Mat exclaimed, holding himself up with the spear haft. “I’m no flaming—! I mean, I
wouldn’t want to usurp your place.” Let them figure out which one of them he meant.
“Burn my soul,” Nalesean said, “it was your battle skill that won for us, and kept us alive. Not to
mention your luck. I’ve heard how you always turn the right card, but it is more than that. I’d follow
you if you had never met the Lord Dragon.”
“You are our leader,” Talmanes said right on top of him, in a voice more sober if no less
certain. “Until yesterday I have followed men of other lands because I must. You I will follow
because I want to. Perhaps you are not a lord in Andor, but here, I say that you are, and I pledge
myself your man.”
Cairhienin and Tairen stared at one another as though startled at voicing the same sentiment, then
slowly, reluctantly, exchanged brief nods. If they did not like each other—and only a fool would bet
against that—they could meet on this point. After a fashion.
“I will send my groom to prepare your horse for the procession,” Talmanes said, and barely
frowned when Nalesean added, “Mine can share the work. Your mount must do us proud. And burn
my soul, we need a banner. Your banner.” At that the Cairhienin nodded emphatically.
Mat was not sure whether to laugh hysterically or sit down and cry. Those bloody memories. If
not for them, he would have ridden on. If not for Rand, he would not have the things. He could trace
the steps that led to them, each necessary as it seemed at the time and seeming an end in itself, yet
each leading inevitably to the next. At the beginning of it all lay Rand. And bloody ta’veren. He could
not understand why doing something that seemed absolutely necessary and as close to harmless as he
could make it always seemed to lead him deeper into the mire. Melindhra had begun stroking the back
of his neck instead of squeezing it. All he needed now . . .
He glanced up the hill, and there she was. Moiraine, on her delicate-stepping white mare, with
Lan on his black stallion towering at her side. The Warder bent toward her as if to listen, and there
seemed to be a brief argument, a violent protest on his part, but after a moment the Aes Sedai reined
Aldieb around and rode out of sight toward the opposite slope. Lan remained where he was on

Mandarb, watching the camp below. Watching Mat.
He shivered. Couladin’s head really did appear to be grinning at him. He could almost hear the
man speak. You may have killed me, but you’ve put your foot squarely in the trap. I’m dead, but
you’ll never be free.
“Just bloody wonderful,” he muttered, and took a long, choking swallow of the rough brandy.
Talmanes and Nalesean seemed to think he meant it as said, and Melindhra laughed agreement.
Some fifty or so Tairens and Cairhienin had gathered to watch the two lords speak to him, and
they took his drinking as a signal to serenade him, beginning with a verse of their own.
“We’ll toss the dice however they fall,
and snuggle the girls be they short or tall,
then follow young Mat whenever he calls,
to dance with Jak o’ the Shadows.”
With a wheezing laugh he could not stop, Mat sank back down onto the boulder and set about
emptying the pitcher. There had to be some way out of this. There just had to be.
Rand’s eyes opened, slowly, staring up at the roof of his tent. He was naked beneath a single
blanket. The absence of pain seemed almost startling, yet he felt even weaker than he remembered.
And he did remember. He had said things, thought things. . . . His skin went cold. I cannot let him
take control. I am me! Me! Fumbling beneath the blanket, he found the smooth round scar on his side,
tender yet whole.
“Moiraine Sedai Healed you,” Aviendha said, and he gave a start.
He had not seen her, sitting cross-legged on the layered rugs near the firepit, sipping from a
silver cup worked with leopards. Asmodean lay sprawled across tasseled cushions, chin on his arms.
Neither appeared to have slept; dark circles underlined their eyes.
“She should not have had to,” Aviendha went on in a cool voice. Tired or not, she had every hair
in place, and her neat clothes were a sharp contrast to Asmodean’s rumpled dark velvets. Now and
then she twisted the ivory bracelet of roses-and-thorns that he had given her as if not realizing what
she was doing. She wore the silver snowflake necklace, too. She still had not told him who had given
it to her, though she had seemed amused when she realized he really wanted to know. She certainly
did not look amused now. “Moiraine Sedai herself was near collapse from Healing wounded.
Aan’allein had to carry her to her tent. Because of you, Rand al’Thor. Because Healing you took the
last of her strength.”
“The Aes Sedai is on her feet already,” Asmodean put in, stifling a yawn. He ignored
Aviendha’s pointed stare. “She has been here twice since sunrise, though she said you would recover.
I think she was not so certain last night. Nor was I.” Pulling his gilded harp around in front of him, he
fussed with it, speaking in an idle tone. “I did what I could for you, of course—my life and fortune are
tied to yours—but my talents lie elsewhere than Healing, you understand.” He strummed a few notes
to demonstrate. “I understand that a man can kill or gentle himself doing what you did. Strength in the
Power is useless if the body is exhausted. Saidin can easily kill, if the body is exhausted. Or so I have
heard.”
“Are you finished sharing your wisdom, Jasin Natael?” Aviendha’s tone was chillier, if
anything, and she did not wait for a reply before turning a gaze like blue-green ice back to Rand. The
interruption, it seemed, was his fault. “A man may behave like a fool sometimes, and little is the

worse for it, but a chief must be more than a man, and the chief of chiefs more still. You had no right
to push yourself near to death. Egwene and I tried to make you come with us when we grew too tired
to continue, but you would not listen. You may be as much stronger than we as Egwene claims, yet
you are still flesh. You are the Car’a’carn, not a new Seia Doon seeking honor. You have toh,
obligation, to the Aiel, Rand al’Thor, and you cannot fulfill it dead. You cannot do everything
yourself.”
For a moment he could only gape at her. He had barely managed to do anything at all, had left the
battle to others for all practical purposes while he stumbled about trying to be useful. He had not even
been able to stop Sammael from striking where and as he chose. And she upbraided him for doing too
much.
“I will try to remember,” he said finally. Even so, she looked ready to lecture more. “What news
of the Miagoma and the other three clans?” he asked, as much to divert her as because he wanted to
know. Women seldom seemed willing to stop until they had hammered you into the ground, unless you
managed to distract them.
It worked. She was full of what she knew, of course, and as eager to instruct as to scold.
Asmodean’s soft strumming—for once, something pleasant, even pastoral—made an odd background
for her words.
The Miagoma, the Shiande, the Daryne and the Codarra were camped within sight of one
another, a few miles to the east. A steady stream of men and Maidens moved between the camps,
including Rand’s, but only among societies, and Indirian and the other chiefs were not stirring. There
was no doubt now that they would come to Rand eventually, but not until the Wise Ones finished their
talks.
“They are still talking?” Rand said. “What under the Light do they have to discuss that takes so
long? The chiefs are coming to follow me, not them.”
She gave him a flat look that would have done credit to Moiraine. “The Wise Ones’ words are
for Wise Ones, Rand al’Thor.” Hesitating, she added, as if making a concession, “Egwene may tell
you something of it. When it is done.” Her tone implied that Egwene might not, too.
She resisted his attempts to learn more, and finally he let it lie. Perhaps he would find out before
it bit him, and perhaps not, but either way, he was not going to pry one word out of her that she did
not want to speak. Aes Sedai had nothing on Aiel Wise Ones when it came to guarding their secrets
and surrounding themselves with mystery. Aviendha was absorbing that particular lesson very well.
Egwene’s presence at the meeting of Wise Ones came as a surprise, and so did Moiraine’s
absence—he would have expected her to be in the middle, twitching strings to her plans—but it
turned out that one grew from the other. The new-come Wise Ones had wanted to meet with one of the
Aes Sedai who followed the Car’a’carn, and although she was back on her feet after Healing him,
Moiraine claimed to have no time. Egwene had been routed from her blankets as a replacement.
That made Aviendha laugh. She had been outside when Sorilea and Bair practically dragged
Egwene from her tent, trying to pull on her clothes while they hustled her along. “I called to her that
she would have to dig holes in the ground with her teeth this time if she had been caught in a misdeed,
and she was so sleepy she believed me. She began protesting that she would not, so hard that Sorilea
began demanding what she had done to think she deserved to. You should have seen Egwene’s face.”
She laughed so hard that she nearly toppled over.
Asmodean actually looked at her askance—though why he should, being what and who he was,
was beyond Rand—but Rand only waited patiently until she caught her breath. For Aiel humor, this
was mild. More the sort of thing he would have expected from Mat than from any woman, but mild

even so.
When she straightened, wiping her eyes, he said, “What of the Shaido, then? Or are their Wise
Ones also at this conclave?”
She answered still giggling into her wine; she considered the Shaido finished, hardly worth
considering now. Thousands of prisoners had been taken, with a trickle still being brought in, and the
fighting had died down except for a few small skirmishes here and there. Yet the more he got out of
her, the less he could see them as done for. With the four clans keeping Han occupied, the bulk of
Couladin’s people had crossed the Gaelin in good order, even carrying away most of the Cairhienin
prisoners they had captured. Worse, they had destroyed the stone bridges behind them.
That did not concern her, but it did him. Tens of thousands of Shaido north of the river, no way
to get at them until the bridges were replaced, and even wooden spans would take time. It was time
that he did not have.
At the very end, when it seemed there was no more to say on the Shaido, she told him what made
him forget worrying about the Shaido and what trouble they would cause. She just tossed it in, as if
she had almost forgotten.
“Mat killed Couladin?” he said incredulously when she was done. “Mat?”
“Did I not say so?” The words were sharp, but halfhearted. Peering at him over her winecup, she
seemed more interested in how he would take the news than in whether he doubted her word.
Asmodean plucked a few chords of something martial; the harp seemed to echo to drums and
trumpets. “In some ways, a young man of as many surprises as you. I truly look forward to meeting the
third of you, this Perrin, one day.”
Rand shook his head. So Mat had not escaped the pull of ta’veren to ta’veren after all. Or
maybe it was the Pattern that had caught him, and being ta’veren himself. Either way, he suspected
Mat was not too happy right that moment. Mat had not learned the lesson that he had. Try to run away,
and the Pattern pulled you back, often roughly; run in the direction the Wheel wove you, and
sometimes you could manage a little control over your life. Sometimes. With luck, maybe more than
any expected, at least in the long haul. But he had more urgent concerns than Mat, or the Shaido.
A glance at the entrance told him the sun was well up, though all he saw otherwise was two
Maidens squatting just outside, spears across their knees. A night and most of a morning with him
unconscious, and Sammael had either not tried to find him or had failed.
He was careful to use that name, even to himself, though another floated in the back of his mind
now. Tel Janin Aellinsar. No history recorded the name, no fragment in the library at Tar Valon;
Moiraine had told him everything the Aes Sedai knew of the Forsaken, and it was little more than was
told in village tales. Even Asmodean had always called him Sammael, if for a different reason. Long
before the War of the Shadow ended, the Forsaken had embraced the names men had given them, as if
symbols of rebirth in the Shadow. Asmodean’s own true name—Joar Addam Nessosin—made the
man flinch, and he claimed to have forgotten the others in the course of three thousand years.
Perhaps there was no real reason to hide what was going on inside his head—maybe it was only
an attempt to deny reality to himself—but Sammael the man would remain. And as Sammael, he
would pay in full for every Maiden he had killed. The Maidens Rand had not been able to keep safe.
Even as he made the resolution, he grimaced. He had made a beginning by sending Weiramon
back to Tear—the Light willing, only he and Weiramon knew how much of one, so far—but he could
not go chasing off after Sammael, whatever he wanted or vowed. Not yet. There were matters to be
seen to here in Cairhien, first. Aviendha might think he did not understand ji’e’toh, and perhaps he
did not, but he understood duty, and he had one to Cairhien. Besides, there were ways to tail it in with

Weiramon.
Sitting up—and trying not to show the effort of it—he covered himself as decently as he could in
the blanket and wondered where his clothes were; he did not see anything but his boots, standing over
behind Aviendha. She probably knew. It might have been gai’shain who undressed him, but it could
just as easily have been she. “I need to go into the city. Natael, have Jeade’en saddled and brought
up.”
“Tomorrow, perhaps,” Aviendha told him firmly, catching Asmodean’s coatsleeve as he started
to rise. “Moiraine Sedai said you would need to rest for—”
“Today, Aviendha. Now. I don’t know why Meilan isn’t here, if he’s alive, but I mean to find
out. Natael, my horse?”
She put on a stubborn face, but Asmodean jerked his arm free, smoothing the wrinkled velvet,
and said, “Meilan was here, and others.”
“He was not to be told—” Aviendha began angrily, then tightened her mouth before finishing,
“He needs to rest.”
So the Wise Ones thought they could keep things from him. Well, he was not as weak as they
believed. He tried to stand, holding the blanket close, and turned the motion into shifting his position
when his legs refused to cooperate. Maybe he was as weak as they thought. But he did not intend to
let that stop him.
“I can rest when I’m dead,” he said, and wished he had not when she flinched as if he had hit
her. No, she would not have flinched at a blow. His staying alive was important to her for the Aiel’s
sake, and a threat there could hurt her more than a fist. “Tell me about Meilan, Natael.”
Aviendha kept a sullen silence, though if looks had had anything to do with it, Asmodean would
have been struck dumb as well.
A rider had come from Meilan in the night, bearing flowery praises and assurances of undying
loyalty. At dawn Meilan himself appeared, with the six other High Lords of Tear who were in the city
and a small host of Tairen soldiers who fingered sword hilts and gripped lances as though more than
half expecting to fight the Aiel who had stood silently watching them ride in.
“It came close,” Asmodean said. “This Meilan is not used to being thwarted, I think, and the
others scarcely more so. Especially the lumpy-faced one—Torean?—and Simaan. That one has eyes
as sharp as his nose. You know I am used to dangerous company, but these men are as dangerous in
their way as any I have known.”
Aviendha sniffed loudly. “Whatever they are used to, they had no choice with Sorilea and Amys
and Bair and Melaine on one side, and Sulin with a thousand Far Dareis Mai on the other. And there
were some Stone Dogs,” she conceded, “and a few Water Seekers and some Red Shields. If you truly
serve the Car’a’carn as you claim, Jasin Natael, you should guard his rest as they do.”
“It is the Dragon Reborn I follow, young woman. The Car’a’carn, I leave to you.”
“Go on, Natael,” Rand said impatiently, earning a sniff for himself.
She was right concerning the Tairens’ choices, though perhaps the Maidens and others fingering
their veils had concerned them more than the Wise Ones. In any case, even Aracome, a graying,
slender man with a long-smoldering temper, had been near bursting aflame by the time they reined
their horses around, and Gueyam, bald as a stone and wide as a blacksmith, was white-faced in rage.
Asmodean was not sure whether it had been the certainty of being overwhelmed that stopped them
drawing swords, or the realization that if they somehow managed to cut a path to Rand, he was
unlikely to welcome them with his allies’ blood on their blades.
“Meilan’s eyes were bulging out of his head,” the man finished. “But before leaving, he shouted

out his allegiance and fealty to you. Perhaps he thought you might hear. The others echoed him
quickly, yet Meilan added something that made them stare. ‘I make a gift of Cairhien to the Lord
Dragon,’ he said. Then he announced that he would prepare a grand triumph for you when you’re
ready to enter the city.”
“There’s an old saying in the Two Rivers,” Rand said dryly. “ ‘The louder a man tells you he’s
honest, the harder you must hold on to your purse.’ ” Another said, “The fox often offers to give the
duck its pond.” Cairhien was his without gifts from Meilan.
He had no doubts about the man’s loyalty. It would last just as long as Meilan believed he would
be destroyed if caught betraying Rand. If caught; that was the hook. Those seven High Lords in
Cairhien had been the most assiduous in trying to see him dead in Tear. That was why he had sent
them here. Had he executed every Tairen noble who plotted against him, there might have been none
left. At the time, handing them anarchy, famine and civil war to deal with a thousand miles from Tear
had seemed a good way to put a crimp in their schemes while doing some good where it needed
doing. Of course, he had not even known Couladin existed then, much less that the man would lead
him to Cairhien.
It would be easier if this was a story, he thought. In stories, there were only so many surprises
before the hero knew everything he needed; he himself never seemed to know a quarter of everything.
Asmodean hesitated—that old saying about shouting men might be applied to him, too, as he was
no doubt aware—but when Rand said no more, he added, “I think he wants to be King of Cairhien.
Subject to you, of course.”
“And preferably with me far away.” Meilan probably expected Rand to return to Tear, and to
Callandor. Meilan certainly would never be afraid of too much power.
“Of course.” Asmodean sounded even drier than Rand had. “There was another visit between
those two.” A dozen Cairhienin lords and ladies, without retainers, came cloaked and with faces
hidden in their hoods despite the heat. Plainly they knew that the Aiel despised Cairhienin, and just as
plainly returned the sentiment, yet they were as nervous that Meilan might discover they had come as
that the Aiel might decide to kill them. “When they saw me,” Asmodean said wryly, “half seemed
ready to kill me for fear I was Tairen. You have Far Dareis Mai to thank that you still have a bard.”
Few as they were, the Cairhienin had still been harder to turn back than Meilan, growing
sweatier and more white-faced by the minute, but stubbornly demanding to see the Lord Dragon. It
was a measure of their desire that when demands failed, they finally descended to open begging.
Asmodean might have thought Aiel humor odd or harsh, but he chuckled over nobles in silk coats and
riding dresses trying to pretend he was not there as they knelt to catch at the Wise Ones’ woolen
skirts.
“Sorilea threatened to have them stripped and flogged back to the city.” His muted laughter
turned disbelieving. “They actually discussed it among themselves. Had the requirement allowed
them to reach you, I do believe some would have accepted.”
“Sorilea should have done it,” Aviendha put in, surprisingly agreeable. “The oathbreakers have
no honor. At last Melaine had the Maidens throw them across their horses like bundles and run the
animals from camp, with the oathbreakers hanging on as they might.”
Asmodean nodded. “But before that, two of them did speak to me, once they were certain I was
not a Tairen spy. Lord Dobraine, and Lady Colavaere. They clouded everything in so many hints and
innuendos that I cannot be certain, but I would not be surprised if they mean to offer you the Sun
Throne. They could bandy words with . . . some people I used to be acquainted with.”
Rand barked a laugh. “Maybe they will. If they can manage the same terms as Meilan.” He had

not needed Moiraine to tell him that Cairhienin played the Game of Houses in their sleep, nor
Asmodean to tell him they would try it with the Forsaken. The High Lords to the left and the
Cairhienin to the right. One battle done, and another, of a different sort if no less dangerous,
beginning. “In any case, I mean the Sun Throne for someone who has a right to it.” He ignored the
speculation on Asmodean’s face; perhaps the man had tried to help him the night before and perhaps
he had not, but he did not trust the fellow enough to let him know half of his plans. However much
Asmodean’s future might be tied to his, his loyalty was all necessity, and he was still the same man
who had chosen to give his soul to the Shadow. “Meilan wants to give me a grand entry when I am
ready, does he? So much the better that I see what’s what before he expects me.” It came to him why
Aviendha had become so agreeable, even helping the talk along. As long as he sat here talking, he
was doing exactly what she wanted. “Are you going to get my horse, Natael, or must I?”
Asmodean’s bow was deep, formal, and on the surface, at least, sincere. “I serve the Lord
Dragon.”

CHAPTER
46

Other Battles, Other Weapons

Frowning after Asmodean and wondering how far he trusted the man, Rand was startled when

Aviendha threw down her cup, splashing wine onto the rugs. Aiel did not waste anything that could be
drunk, not only water.
Staring at the wet spot, she appeared just as surprised, but only for a moment. The next instant
she had planted fists on hips where she sat and was glaring at him. “So the Car’a’carn will enter the
city when he can barely sit up. I said the Car’a’carn must be more than other men, but I did not know
he was more than mortal.”
“Where are my clothes, Aviendha?”
“You are only flesh!”
“My clothes?”
“Remember your toh, Rand al’Thor. If I can remember ji’e’toh, so can you.” That seemed a
strange thing to say; the sun would rise at midnight before she forgot the smallest scrap of ji’e’toh.
“If you keep on like this,” he said with a smile, “I will begin thinking you care for me.”
He meant it for a jest—there were only two ways to deal with her, joke or simply override her;
arguing was fatal—and a mild one considering they had spent a night in each other’s arms, but her
eyes went wide in outrage, and she jerked at the ivory bracelet as if to pull it off and throw it at him.
“The Car’a’carn is so far above other men that he does not need clothes,” she spat. “If he wishes to
go, let him go in his skin! Must I bring Sorilea and Bair? Or perhaps Enaila, and Somara, and
Lamelle?”
He stiffened. Of all the Maidens who treated him as a long-lost son of ten, she had chosen the
three worst. Lamelle even brought him soup—the woman could not cook a lick, but she insisted on
making him soup! “You bring whoever you wish,” he told her in a tight, flat voice, “but I am the
Car’a’carn, and I am going into the city.” With luck, he could find his clothes before she returned.
Somara was nearly as tall as he, and, at the moment, probably stronger. The One Power certainly
would do him no good; he could not have embraced saidin if Sammael appeared in front of him, much
less held onto it.
For a long moment she met his stare, then abruptly picked up the leopard-worked cup and
refilled it from a hammered-silver pitcher. “If you can find your clothes and dress yourself without
falling down,” she said calmly, “you may go. But I will accompany you, and if I think you are too
weak to continue, you will return here if Somara must carry you in her arms.”
He stared as she stretched out on one elbow, carefully arranged her skirts, and began sipping at
her wine. If he mentioned marriage again, no doubt she would snap his head off again, but in some
ways she behaved as if they were married. The worst parts of it, at least. The parts that did not seem

a pennyworth different from Enaila or Lamelle at their worst.
Muttering to himself, he gathered the blanket around him and shuffled past her and the firepit to
his boots. Clean woolen stockings were folded up inside, but nothing else. He could summon
gai’shain. And have the entire matter spread through the camp. Not to mention the possibility that the
Maidens would get into it after all; then the question would be whether he was the Car’a’carn, who
must be obeyed, or just Rand al’Thor, another man entirely in their eyes. A rolled rug at the back of
the tent caught his eye; rugs were always spread out. His sword was inside, the belt with the Dragon
buckle wrapped around the scabbard.
Humming to herself, eyes lidded, Aviendha looked half asleep as she watched him search. “You
no longer need . . . that.” She invested the word with so much disgust that no one would have
believed she had given him the sword.
“What do you mean?” There were only a few small chests in the tent, inlaid with mother-ofpearl or worked in brass, or in one case, gold leaf. The Aiel preferred putting things in bundles. None
held his clothes. The gold-covered chest, all unfamiliar birds and animals, held tightly tied leather
sacks and gave off a smell of spices when he raised the lid.
“Couladin is dead, Rand al’Thor.”
Startled, he stopped and stared at her. “What are you talking about?” Would Lan have told her?
No one else knew. But why?
“No one told me, if that is what you are thinking. I know you now, Rand al’Thor. I learn you
more every day.”
“I wasn’t thinking any such thing,” he growled. “There isn’t anything anybody could tell.”
Irritably, he snatched up the scabbarded sword and carried it awkwardly under his arm as he went on
searching. Aviendha continued sipping wine; he thought she might be hiding a smile.
A fine thing. The High Lords of Tear sweated when Rand al’Thor looked at them, and the
Cairhienin might offer him their throne. The greatest Aiel army the world had ever seen had crossed
the Dragonwall on the orders of the Car’a’carn, the chief of chiefs. Nations trembled at mention of
the Dragon Reborn. Nations! And if he did not find his clothes, he would sit waiting on permission to
go outside from a lot of women who thought they knew better about everything than he did.
He finally found them when he noticed the gold-embroidered cuff of a red coatsleeve sticking
out from under Aviendha. She had been sitting on them all along. She grunted sourly when he asked
her to move, but she did it. Finally.
As usual, she watched him shave and dress, channeling the water hot for him without comment—
and without being asked—after the third time he nicked himself and muttered about cold water. In
truth, this time he was bothered as much because she might see his unsteadiness as for any other
cause. You can become used to anything if it goes on long enough, he thought wryly.
She misunderstood his head shaking. “Elayne will not mind if I look, Rand al’Thor.”
Pausing with the laces of his shirt half done, he stared at her. “Do you really believe that?”
“Of course. You belong to her, but she cannot own the sight of you.”
Laughing silently, he went back to the laces. It was good to be reminded that her newfound
mystery hid ignorance, aside from anything else. He could not help smiling smugly as he finished
dressing, buckled on his sword and took up the tasseled Seanchan spearhead. That last turned the
smile a touch toward grimness. He had meant it as a reminder that the Seanchan were still in the
world, but it served to recall all the things that he must juggle. Cairhienin and Tairens, Sammael and
the other Forsaken, the Shaido and nations that did not know him yet, nations that would have to
before Tarmon Gai’don. Dealing with Aviendha was really quite simple compared with that.

Maidens leaped to their feet when he ducked out of the tent quickly to hide the unsteadiness of
his legs. He was not sure how far he succeeded. Aviendha kept to his side as though she not only
intended to catch him if he fell over but fully expected him to. It did nothing for his mood when Sulin,
in her cap of bandages, looked questioningly at her—not him; her!—and waited for her nod before
ordering the Maidens to be ready to move.
Asmodean came riding his mule up the hill, leading Jeade’en by the reins. Somehow he had
found time to don fresh clothes, all dark green silk. With spills of white lace, of course. The gilded
harp hung on his back, but he had given up wearing the gleeman’s cloak, and he no longer carried the
crimson banner with its ancient symbol of the Aes Sedai. That office fell to a Cairhienin refugee
named Pevin, an expressionless fellow in a patched farmer’s coat of rough dark gray wool, on a
brown mule that should have been put out to grass from pulling a cart some years back. A long scar,
still red, ran up the side of his narrow face from jaw to thinning hair.
Pevin had lost his wife and sister to the famine, his brother and a son to the civil war. He had no
idea which Houses’ men had killed them, or who they had supported for the Sun Throne. Fleeing
toward Andor had cost him a second son at the hands of Andoran soldiers and a second brother to
bandits, and returning had cost the last son, dead on a Shaido spear, and his daughter as well, carried
off while Pevin was left for dead. The man rarely spoke, but as near as Rand could make out, his
beliefs had been winnowed down to a bare three. The Dragon had been Reborn. The Last Battle was
coming. And if he stayed close to Rand al’Thor, he would see his family avenged before the world
was destroyed. The world would end, surely, but it did not matter, nothing did, so long as he saw that
vengeance. He bowed silently to Rand from his saddle as the mare reached the crest. His face was
absolutely blank, but he held the banner straight and steady.
Climbing onto Jeade’en, Rand pulled Aviendha up behind him without letting her use a stirrup,
just to show her that he could, and kicked the dapple into motion before she was settled. She flung
both arms around his waist, grumbling only partly under her breath; he caught a few more snippets of
her current opinion of Rand al’Thor, and of the Car’a’carn, too. She made no move to let go, though,
for which he was grateful. Not only was it pleasant having her pressed against his back, the support
was welcome. With her halfway to the saddle, he had suddenly not been sure whether she was coming
up or he down. He hoped she had not noticed. He hoped that was not why she was holding on to him
so tightly.
The crimson banner with its large black-and-white disc rippled behind Pevin as they zigzagged
down the hill and along the shallow valleys. As usual, the Aiel gave little attention to the party as it
passed, though the banner marked his presence as surely as the encircling escort of several hundred
Far Dareis Mai easily keeping pace with Jeade’en and the mules. They went on about their business
among the tents covering the slopes, at most glancing up at the sound of hooves.
It had been startling to hear of nearly twenty thousand prisoners taken from Couladin’s followers
—until leaving the Two Rivers, he had never really believed so many people could be in one place—
but seeing them was twice the shock. In clusters of forty or fifty, they dotted the hillsides like
cabbages, men and women alike sitting naked in the sun, each cluster under the eyes of one gai’shain,
if that. Certainly no one else paid them much mind, though now and again a cadin’sor-clad figure
approached one of the groups and ordered a man or woman off on an errand. Whoever was called out
went at a run, unguarded, and Rand saw several returning to slip back into their places. For the rest,
they sat quietly, almost looking bored, as if they had no reason to be elsewhere, or desire to be,
either.
Perhaps they would put on white robes just as calmly. Yet he could not help remembering how

easily these same people had violated their own laws and customs already. Couladin might have
begun the violation or ordered it, but they had followed and obeyed.
Frowning at the prisoners—twenty thousand, and more to come; he would certainly never trust
one to hold to gai’shain—it took some time before he noticed an oddity among the other Aiel.
Maidens and Aielmen who carried the spear never wore anything on their heads except the shoufa,
and never any color that would not fade into rocks and shadows, but now he saw men with a narrow
scarlet headband. Perhaps one in four or five had a strip of cloth knotted around his temples, with a
disc embroidered or painted above the brows, two joined teardrops, black and white. Perhaps most
strangely of all, gai’shain wore it, too; most had their cowls up, but every last bareheaded one wore
it. And algai’d’siswai in their cadin’sor saw and did nothing, whether wearing the headband or not.
Gai’shain were never to wear anything that those who could touch weapons did. Never.
“I do not know,” Aviendha said curtly into his back when he asked what it meant. He tried to sit
up straighter; she really did seem to be holding to him more tightly than necessary. After a moment,
she went on, so softly that he had to listen sharp to catch it all. “Bair threatened to strike me if I
mentioned it again, and Sorilea hit me across the shoulders with a stick, but I think they are those who
claim we are siswai’aman.”
Rand opened his mouth to ask the meaning—he knew a scant few words of the Old Tongue, no
more—when interpretation floated to the surface in his mind. Siswai’aman. Literally, the spear of the
Dragon.
“Sometimes,” Asmodean chuckled, “it is difficult to see the difference between oneself and
one’s enemies. They want to own the world, but it seems you already own a people.”
Turning his head, Rand stared at him until amusement faded and, shrugging uncomfortably, he let
his mule fall back beside Pevin and the banner. The trouble was that the name did imply—more than
implied—ownership; that was out of Lews Therin’s memories, too. It did not seem possible to own
people, but if it was, he did not want to. All I want is to use them, he thought wryly.
“I see you don’t believe it,” he said over his shoulder. None of the Maidens had donned the
thing.
Aviendha hesitated before saying, “I do not know what to believe.” She spoke as quietly as
before, yet she sounded angry, and unsure. “There are many beliefs, and the Wise Ones are often
silent, as if they do not know the truth. Some say that in following you, we expiate the sin of our
ancestors in . . . in failing the Aes Sedai.”
The catch in her voice startled him; he had never considered that she might be as worried as any
other Aiel about what he had revealed of their past. Ashamed might be a better word than worried;
shame was an important part of ji’e’toh. They were ashamed of what they had been—followers of the
Way of the Leaf—and at the same time ashamed that they had abandoned their pledge to it.
“Too many have heard some version of part of the Prophecy of Rhuidean now,” she went on in a
more controlled tone, for all the world as if she had heard a word of that prophecy herself before she
began training to become a Wise One, “but it has been twisted. They know that you will destroy us
. . .” Her control faltered for the space of one deep breath. “But many believe that you will kill us all
in endless dances of the spear, a sacrifice to atone for the sin. Others believe that the bleakness itself
is a testing, to wear away all but the hard core before the Last Battle. I have even heard some say that
the Aiel are now your dream, and that when you wake from this life, we will be no more.”
A grim set of beliefs, that. Bad enough that he had revealed a past they saw as shaming. It was a
wonder they had not all left him. Or gone mad. “What do the Wise Ones believe?” he asked, as
quietly as she.

“That what must be, will be. We will save what can be saved, Rand al’Thor. We do not hope to
do more.”
We. She included herself among the Wise Ones, just as Egwene and Elayne included themselves
among Aes Sedai. “Well,” he said lightly, “I expect Sorilea at least believes I should have my ears
boxed. Probably Bair does, too. And certainly Melaine.”
“Among other things,” she mumbled. To his disappointment, she pushed away from him, although
keeping a hold on his coat. “They believe many things I could wish they did not.”
He grinned in spite of himself. So she did not believe he needed his ears boxed. That was a
pleasant change since waking.
Hadnan Kadere’s wagons lay a mile or so from his tent, circled in a broad depression between
two hills where Stone Dogs kept watch. A cream-colored coat straining over his bulk, the hatchetnosed Darkfriend looked up, mopping his face with the inevitable large handkerchief, as Rand rode
past with his banner and loping escort. Moiraine was there as well, examining the wagon where the
doorframe ter’angreal was lashed under canvas behind the driver’s seat. She did not even glance
around until Kadere spoke to her. By his gestures, he was plainly suggesting that she might want to
accompany Rand. In fact, he appeared eager for her to go, and small wonder. He had to be
congratulating himself on keeping his being a Darkfriend hidden so long, but the more he was in
company with an Aes Sedai, the more he was in danger of discovery.
Indeed, it was a surprise to Rand that the man was still there. At least half of the drivers who
had entered the Waste with him had slipped away since crossing the Dragonwall, replaced by
Cairhienin refugees chosen by Rand himself, to make sure they were not of Kadere’s sort. He
expected every morning to find the fellow himself gone, too, especially since Isendre’s escape. The
Maidens had nearly torn the wagons apart looking for the woman, while Kadere sweated his way
through three handkerchiefs. Rand would not regret it if Kadere managed to sneak off in the night. The
Aiel guards had orders to let him go, so long as he did not try to take Moiraine’s precious wagons.
More obviously every day, their loads were a treasure to her, and Rand would not see her lose them.
He glanced over his shoulder, but Asmodean was staring straight ahead, ignoring the wagons
altogether. He claimed to have had no contact with Kadere since Rand captured him, and Rand
thought it might be true. Certainly, the merchant never left his wagons, and was never out of sight of
Aiel guards except when inside his own wagon.
Opposite the wagons, Rand half drew rein without thinking. Surely Moiraine would want to
accompany him into Cairhien; she might have crammed his head full, but it always seemed there was
another piece she wanted to fit in, and this once in particular he could do with her presence and
advice. But she merely looked at him for a long moment, then turned back to the wagon.
Frowning, he heeled the dapple on. As well to remember she had other sheep to shear than he
knew about. He had become too trusting. Best to be as wary of her as of Asmodean.
Trust no one, he thought bleakly. For an instant he did not know whether it was his thought or
Lews Therin’s, but in the end he decided it did not matter. Everybody had their own goals, their own
desires. Much the best to trust no one completely except himself. Yet he wondered, with another man
oozing through the back of his mind, how far could he trust himself?
Vultures filled the sky around Cairhien in spiraling layers of black wings. On the ground they
flapped about among clouds of buzzing flies, squawking hoarsely at glossy ravens that tried to usurp
their rights to the dead. Where Aiel went across the treeless hills, recovering the bodies of their slain,
the birds lumbered aloft fatly, screeching protests, then settled again as soon as the living humans
were a few paces gone. Vultures and ravens and flies together could not really have made the sunlight

dimmer, yet it seemed so.
Stomach twisting, trying not to see, Rand heeled Jeade’en faster, until Aviendha clung to his
back once more and the Maidens were running. No one protested, and he did not believe it was only
because Aiel could maintain that speed for hours. Even Asmodean looked pale around the eyes.
Pevin’s face never changed, though the bright banner whipping above him appeared a mockery in that
place.
What lay ahead was little better. Rand remembered the Foregate as a raucous beehive, a tangled
warren of streets full of noise and color. Now it was a still, thick band of ashes surrounding the
square gray walls of Cairhien on three sides. Charred timbers lay crazily atop stone foundations, and
here and there a soot-black chimney yet stood, sometimes tilting precariously. In places, a chair lying
somehow untouched in the dirt street, a hasty bundle dropped by someone fleeing, a rag doll,
emphasized the desolation.
Breezes stirred some of the banners on the city’s towers and along the walls, a Dragon standing
out red-and-gold on white at one place, the Crescents of Tear white on red-and-gold at another. The
middle set of the Jangai Gates stood open, three tall square arches in the gray stone guarded by Tairen
soldiers in rimmed helmets. Some were mounted but most afoot, and the variously colored stripes on
their wide sleeves showed they were retainers of several lords.
Whatever was known in the city about the battle being won, and Aiel allies coming to the rescue,
the approach of half a thousand Far Dareis Mai created some little stir. Hands went uncertainly to
sword hilts, or spears and long shields, or lances. Some of the soldiers half moved as if to close the
gates even while looking to their officer, with three white plumes on his helmet, who hesitated,
standing in his stirrups and shading his eyes against the sun to study the crimson banner. And more
particularly, Rand.
Abruptly the officer sat down, saying something that sent two of the mounted Tairens galloping
back through the gates. Almost immediately, he was waving the other men aside, calling, “Make way
for the Lord Dragon Rand al’Thor! The Light illumine the Lord Dragon! All glory to the Dragon
Reborn!”
The soldiers still appeared uneasy about the Maidens, but they formed into lines to either side of
the gates, bowing deeply as Rand rode through. Aviendha sniffed loudly at his back, and again when
he laughed. She did not understand, and he had no intention of explaining. What amused him was that
however hard Tairens or Cairhienin or anyone else tried to puff up his head, he could rely on her and
the Maidens, at least, to take the swelling down. And Egwene. And Moiraine. And Elayne and
Nynaeve, for that matter, if he ever saw either again. Come to think of it, the lot of them seemed to
make that a large part of their life’s work.
The city beyond the gates stilled his laughter.
Here the streets were paved, some broad enough for a dozen or more large wagons abreast, all
straight as knife cuts and crossing at right angles. The hills that rolled outside the walls were here
carved and terraced, faced with stone; they looked as much made by men as the stone buildings with
their severe straight lines and sharp angles, or the great towers with their unfinished tops, surrounded
by scaffolding. People crowded the streets and the alleys, dull-eyed and hollow-cheeked, huddling
beneath makeshift lean-tos or ragged blankets rigged as tents, or simply jammed together in the open,
in the dark clothes favored by Cairhienin city dwellers and the bright colors of Foregaters and the
rough garb of farmers and villagers. Even the scaffolds were filled, on every level to the very top,
where folk looked tiny for the height. Only the middle of the streets remained clear as Rand and the
Maidens made their way along, and that only for as long as it took the people to surge out around

them.
It was the people who stilled his mirth. Worn and ragged as they were, jammed together like
sheep in a too-small pen, they cheered. He had no idea how they knew who he was, unless perhaps
the officer’s shouts at the gates had been heard, but a roar sprang ahead of him as he circled through
the streets, the Maidens forcing a way through the throng. The thunder of it overwhelmed any words
except for the occasional “Lord Dragon” when enough shouted it together, but the meaning was clear
in men and women holding up children to see him pass, in scarves and scraps of cloth waved from
every window, in people who tried to push past the Maidens with outstretched hands.
They certainly seemed to have no fear of Aiel, not at the chance to lay a finger on Rand’s boots,
and their numbers were such, the pressure of hundreds shoving them forward, that some managed to
wriggle through. Actually, a good many touched Asmodean’s instead—he certainly looked a lord, in
all his dripping lace, and perhaps they thought the Lord Dragon must be an older man than the youth in
a red coat—but it made no difference. Whoever managed to put hand to anyone’s boot or stirrup, even
Pevin’s, wore joy on their faces and mouthed “Lord Dragon” into the din even as Maidens forced
them back with their bucklers.
Between the clamor of acclaim and the riders sent by the officer at the gate, it was no surprise
when Meilan appeared, a dozen lesser Tairen lords for retinue and fifty Defenders of the Stone to
clear his way, laying about them with the butts of their lances. Gray-haired, hard and lean in his fine
silk coat with stripes and cuffs of green satin, the High Lord sat his saddle with the stiff-backed ease
of one who had been put on a horse and taught to command it almost as soon as he could walk. He
ignored the sweat on his face, and equally the possibility that his escort might trample someone. Both
were minor annoyances and the sweat likely the greater.
Edorion, the pink-cheeked lordling who had come to Eianrod, was among the others, not quite so
plump as he had been, so his red-striped coat hung on him. The only other Rand recognized was a
broad-shouldered fellow in shades of green; Reimon had liked to play at cards with Mat back in the
Stone, as he recalled. The others were older men for the most part. None displayed any more
consideration of the crowd they plowed through than Meilan. There was not one Cairhienin in the lot.
The Maidens let Meilan ride through when Rand nodded, but closed behind him to exclude the
rest, a fact the High Lord did not notice at first. When he did, his dark eyes smoldered angrily. He
was often angry, Meilan was, since Rand had first come to the Stone of Tear.
The noise began to abate with the Tairen arrival, fading to a dull murmur by the time Meilan
made a rigid bow to Rand from his saddle. His gaze flickered to Aviendha before he decided to
ignore her, just as he was trying to ignore the Maidens. “The Light illumine you, my Lord Dragon. Be
you well come to Cairhien. I must apologize for the peasants, but I was unaware you meant to enter
the city now. Had I known, they would have been cleared. I meant to give you a grand entry, befitting
the Dragon Reborn.”
“I have had one,” Rand said, and the other man blinked.
“As you say, my Lord Dragon.” He went on after a moment, his tone making it clear that he did
not understand. “If you will accompany me to the Royal Palace, I have arranged a small greeting.
Small indeed, I fear, since I had no warning of you, yet by this even I will make sure—”
“Whatever you have arranged now will do,” Rand cut in, and received another bow and a thin,
oily smile for reply. The fellow was all subservience now, and in an hour he would be talking as to
someone too feeble-witted to understand facts held under his nose, but beneath it all lay a contempt
and hatred that he believed Rand did not see although they shone in his eyes. Contempt because Rand
was not a lord—not truly, as Meilan saw it, by birth—and hatred because Meilan had had the power

of life and death before Rand came, with few his equal and none his superior. To believe that the
Prophecies of the Dragon would be fulfilled someday was one thing; to have them fulfilled, and his
own power diminished by them, was quite another.
There was a moment of confusion before Rand made Sulin allow the other Tairen lords to bring
their horses in behind Asmodean and Pevin’s banner. Meilan would have had the Defenders clear the
way again, but Rand curtly ordered that they follow behind the Maidens. The soldiers obeyed, faces
unchanging beneath the rims of their helmets, though their white-plumed officer shook his head, and
the High Lord put on a condescending smile. That smile faded when it became clear that the crowds
opened up easily ahead of the Maidens. That they did not have to club a path through, he attributed to
the Aiel reputation for savagery, and frowned when Rand made no reply. One thing Rand made note
of: Now that he had Tairens with him, the cheers did not rise again.
The Royal Palace of Cairhien occupied the highest hill of the city, exactly in the center, square
and dark and massive. In fact, between the palace in all its levels and the stone-faced terracing, it was
hard to say there was a hill there at all. Lofty colonnaded walks and tall narrow windows, high above
the ground, did no more to relieve the ridigity than did gray, stepped towers precisely placed in
concentric squares of increasing height. The street became a long, broad ramp leading up to tall
bronze gates, and a huge square courtyard beyond lined with Tairen soldiers standing like statues,
spears slanted. More stood on the overlooking stone balconies.
A ripple of murmurs ran through the ranks at the appearance of the Maidens, but it was quickly
stilled in chanted shouts of “All glory to the Dragon Reborn! All glory to the Lord Dragon and Tear!
All glory to the Lord Dragon and the High Lord Meilan!” From Meilan’s expression, you would have
thought it all spontaneous.
Dark-garbed servants, the first Cairhienin Rand had seen in the palace, rushed out with worked
golden bowls and white linen cloths as he swung a leg over the high pommel and slid from his saddle.
Others came to take reins. He took the excuse of bathing his face and hands in cool water to leave
Aviendha to climb down by herself. Trying to help her down might have ended with them both flat on
the paving stones.
Unprompted, Sulin chose out twenty Maidens besides herself to accompany him within. On the
one hand, he was glad she did not want to keep every last spear around him. On the other hand, he
wished Enaila, Lamelle and Somara were not among the twenty. The considering looks they gave him
—especially Lamelle, a lean, strong-jawed woman with dark red hair, nearly twenty years older than
he—made him grind his teeth while trying to smile reassuringly. Somehow Aviendha must have
managed to speak to them, and to Sulin, behind his back. I may not be able to do anything about the
Maidens, he thought grimly as he tossed a linen towel back to one of the serving men, but burn me if
there isn’t one Aiel woman who’ll learn I’m the Car’a’carn!
The other High Lords greeted him at the foot of the broad gray stairs that led up from the
courtyard, all in colorful silk coats and satin stripes and silver-worked boots. It was plain that none
were aware Meilan had gone to meet him until after the fact. Potato-faced Torean, oddly languid for
such a lumpy man, sniffed anxiously at a scented handkerchief. Gueyam, oiled beard making his head
seem even balder, clenched fists the size of small hams and glared at Meilan even as he bowed to
Rand. Simaan’s sharp nose seemed to quiver in outrage; Maraconn, with blue eyes rare in Tear,
compressed his thin lips until they almost disappeared; and while Hearne’s narrow face was all
smiles, he tugged unconsciously at one ear-lobe as he did when furious. Only blade-slender Aracome
showed no outward emotion, but then he almost always kept his anger well banked until ready to let it
burst into flame.

It was too good an opportunity to miss. Silently thanking Moiraine for her lessons—it was easier
to trip a fool than to knock him down, she said—Rand clasped Torean’s pudgy hand warmly and
clapped Gueyam on the point of a thick shoulder, returned Hearne’s smile with one warm enough for
a close companion and nodded silently to Aracome with a seemingly significant glance. Simaan and
Maraconn he all but ignored after one look as flat and cool as a deep winter pond for each.
That was all it needed for the moment, beyond watching their eyes shift and faces tighten in
thought. They had played Daes Dae’mar, the Game of Houses, their entire lives, and being among
Cairhienin, who could read volumes in a raised eyebrow or a cough, had only heightened their
sensitivity. Each man knew Rand had no reason to be friendly toward him, but each had to wonder if
his own greeting was only to cover something real with someone else. Simaan and Maraconn
appeared the most worried, yet the others eyed those two perhaps the most suspiciously of all.
Perhaps his coolness had been the true cover. Or maybe that was what they were meant to think.
For himself, Rand thought that Moiraine would be proud of him, and so would Thom Merrilin.
Even if none of these seven was actively plotting against him at the moment—something he did not
think even Mat would bet on—men in their positions could do much to disrupt his plans without being
seen to, and they would do so from habit if for no other reason. Or they would have. He had them off
balance now. If he could keep them that way, they would be too busy watching each other, and too
afraid of being watched in turn, to trouble him. They might even obey for once without finding a
hundred reasons why things should be done differently from what he wanted. Well, that might be
asking too much.
His satisfaction slipped when he saw Asmodean’s sardonic grin. Worse was Aviendha’s
wondering stare. She had been in the Stone of Tear; she knew who these men were, and why he had
sent them here. I do what I must, he thought sourly, and wished it did not sound as if he were trying to
excuse himself.
“Inside,” he said, more sharply than he intended, and the seven High Lords jumped as if
suddenly recalling who and what he was.
They wanted to crowd around him as he climbed the stairs, but except for Meilan to show the
way, the Maidens simply made a solid circle around him, and the High Lords brought up the rear with
Asmodean and the lesser lords. Avienda stuck close by . . . of course, and Sulin was on his other
side, Somara and Lamelle and Enaila right behind him. They could have reached out and touched his
back without stretching. He gave Aviendha an accusing look, and she arched her eyebrows at him so
questioningly that he almost believed she had had nothing to do with it. Almost.
The corridors of the palace were empty except for dark-liveried servants who bowed almost
chest to knees or curtsied just as deeply as he passed, but when he entered the Grand Hall of the Sun
he discovered that the Cairhienin nobility had not been excluded from the palace entirely.
“The Dragon Reborn comes,” intoned a white-haired man just inside the huge gilded doors
worked with the Rising Sun. His red coat embroidered with six-pointed stars in blue, a little large on
him after his time in Cairhien, marked him for an upper servant of Meilan’s House. “All hail the Lord
Dragon Rand al’Thor. All glory to the Lord Dragon.”
A quick roar filled the chamber to its angle-vaulted ceiling, fifty paces up. “Hail the Lord
Dragon Rand al’Thor! All glory to the Lord Dragon! The Light illumine the Lord Dragon!” The
silence that followed seemed twice as still by comparison.
Between massive square columns of marble thick-streaked with blue so deep it was almost
black stood more Tairens than Rand expected, ranks of Lords and Ladies of the Land dressed in their
finest, in peaked velvet hats and coats with puffy, striped sleeves, in colorful gowns and lace ruffs

and close-fitting caps intricately embroidered or sewn with pearls or small gems.
To their rear were the Cairhienin, darkly garbed except for slashes of color across the breast of
gown or knee-length coat. The more stripes in House colors, the higher the rank of the wearer, but
men and women with color from neck to waist or lower stood behind Tairens clearly of minor
Houses, with yellow embroidery instead of thread-of-gold and wool instead of silk. No few of the
Cairhienin men had shaved and powdered the front of their heads; all of the younger men had.
The Tairens looked expectant, if uneasy; the Cairhienin faces could have been chiseled from ice.
There was no way to say who had cheered and who not, but Rand suspected most of those cries had
come from the front rows.
“A good many wished to serve you here,” Meilan murmured as they made their way up the bluetiled floor with its great golden mosaic of the Rising Sun. A ripple of silent curtsies and bows
followed.
Rand only grunted. They wished to serve him? He did not need Moiraine to know that these
lesser nobles hoped to become greater on estates carved out of Cairhien. No doubt Meilan and the
other six had already intimated if not promised which lands would be whose.
At the far end of the Grand Hall, the Sun Throne itself stood centered atop a wide dais of deep
blue marble. Even here Cairhienin restraint held, for a throne at any rate. The great heavy-armed chair
glittered with gilt and golden silk, but somehow it seemed to be all plain vertical lines, except for the
wavy-rayed Rising Sun that would stand above the head of whoever sat on it.
That was meant to be him, Rand realized long before reaching the nine steps to the dais.
Aviendha climbed up with him, and Asmodean, as his bard, was allowed up as well, but Sulin
quickly arrayed the other Maidens around the dais, their casually held spears blocking Meilan as well
as the rest of the High Lords. Frustration painted those Tairen faces. The Hall was so quiet that Rand
could hear himself breathe.
“This belongs to someone else,” he said finally. “Besides, I’ve spent too long in the saddle to
welcome such a hard seat. Bring me a comfortable chair.”
There was a moment of shocked silence before a murmur ran through the Hall. Meilan suddenly
wore such a look of speculation, quickly suppressed, that Rand nearly laughed. Very likely Asmodean
was right about the man. Asmodean himself was eyeing Rand with barely hidden surmise.
It was some minutes before the fellow in the star-embroidered coat ran up panting, followed by
two dark-liveried Cairhienin carrying a high-backed chair piled with silk-covered cushions, and
pointed out where to place it with a great many worried glances at Rand. Vertical lines of gilt ran up
the chair’s heavy legs and back, but it seemed insignificant in front of the Sun Throne.
While the three servants were still bowing themselves away, bending double on every step,
Rand tossed most of the cushions to one side and sat down gratefully, the Seanchan spearhead on his
knee. He was careful not to sigh, though. Aviendha was watching him too carefully for that, and the
way Somara kept glancing from her to him and back confirmed his suspicions.
But whatever his problems with Aviendha and Far Dareis Mai, most present awaited his words
with equal parts eagerness and trepidation. At least they’ll jump when I say “toad,” he thought. They
might not like it, but they would do it.
With Moiraine’s help he had worked out what he must do here. Some he had known was right
even without her suggestions. It would have been good to have her there to whisper in his ear if
needed, instead of Aviendha waiting to signal Somara, but there was no point in waiting. Surely every
Tairen and Cairhienin noble in the city was in this chamber.
“Why do the Cairhienin hang back?” he said loudly, and the crowd of nobles shifted, exchanging

confused glances. “Tairens came to help, but that is no reason for Cairhienin to hold themselves in the
rear here. Let everyone sort themselves by rank. Everyone.”
It was difficult to say whether Tairens or Cairhienin were the most stunned, though Meilan
looked ready to swallow his tongue, and the other six not far behind. Even slow-burning Aracome
went white in the face. With much shuffling of boots and twitching aside of skirts, with many icy
stares on both sides, it was done, until the front rows were all men and women with stripes across
their chests and the second held only a few Tairens. Meilan and his fellows had been joined at the
foot of the dais by twice their number of Cairhienin lords and ladies, most graying and everyone
stripes from neck nearly to knees, though perhaps “joined” was not the right word. They stood in two
groups, with a full three paces between, and looked away from one another so hard that they might as
well have shaken fists and shouted. Every eye was on Rand, and if the Tairens were in a fury, the
Cairhienin were still ice, with only hints of a thaw in the considering way they studied him.
“I have noticed the banners flying above Cairhien,” he went on once the movement stilled. “It is
well that so many of the Crescents of Tear fly. Without Tairen grain, Cairhien would have no living to
hoist a banner, and without Tairen swords, the people of this city who survived today, noble as well
as common, would be learning to obey the Shaido. Tear has earned her honor.” That puffed up the
Tairens, of course, bringing fierce nods and fiercer smiles, though it certainly seemed to confuse the
High Lords, coming on the heels of the other. For that matter, the Cairhienin below the dais were
eyeing one another doubtfully. “But I do not need so many banners for myself. Let one Dragon banner
remain, on the highest tower of the city so all who approach can see, but let the rest be taken down
and replaced with the banners of Cairhien. This is Cairhien, and the Rising Sun must and will fly
proudly. Cairhien has her own honor, which she shall keep.”
The chamber erupted in a roar so suddenly that Maidens hefted their spears, a roar that
reverberated from wall to wall. In an instant Sulin was flashing Maiden handtalk, but already halfraised veils were being let fall. The Cairhienin nobles were cheering every bit as loudly as the
people in the streets had, capering and waving their arms like Foregaters at festival. In the
pandemonium it was the Tairens’ turn to exchange silent stares. They did not look angry. Even Meilan
appeared unsure more than anything else, though like Torean and the others, he watched in amazement
the lords and ladies of high rank around him, so coldly dignified a moment before, now dancing and
shouting for the Lord Dragon.
Rand did not know what any of them read into his words. Certainly he had expected them to hear
more than he said, especially the Cairhienin, and perhaps even that some would hear what he really
meant, but nothing had prepared him for this display. Cairhienin reserve was an odd thing, he well
knew, mixed at times with unexpected boldness. Moiraine had been reticent on the matter, for all her
insistence on trying to teach him everything; the most she had said was that if that reserve broke, it
could do so to a surprising degree. Surprising, indeed.
When the cheering finally died down, the giving of oaths of fealty began. Meilan was the first to
kneel, tight-faced as he pledged under the Light and by his hope of salvation and rebirth to serve
faithfully and obey; it was an old form, and Rand hoped it might actually constrain some to keep the
oath. Once Meilan had kissed the tip of the Seanchan spearhead, trying to hide a sour grimace by
stroking his beard, he was replaced by the Lady Colavaere. A more than handsome woman in her
middle years, with dark ivory lace spilling over the hands she placed between Rand’s, and horizontal
slashes of color from high lace collar to her knees, she gave the oath in a clear, firm voice and the
musical accent he was used to hearing from Moiraine. Her dark gaze had something of the weighingand-measuring look of Moiraine as well, most especially when she eyed Aviendha as she curtsied her

way back down the steps. Torean replaced her, sweating as he swore, and Lord Dobraine replaced
Torean, deep-set eyes probing, one of the few older men to have shaved the front of his long, mostly
gray hair, then Aracome, and . . .
Rand felt impatience as the procession continued, one by one up to kneel before him, Cairhienin
succeeding Tairen succeeding Cairhienin, as he had decreed. This was all necessary, so Moiraine
said—and so agreed a voice in his head that he knew for Lews Therin’s—but to him it was part of the
delay. He must have their loyalty, if only on the surface, in order to begin making Cairhien secure, and
that beginning, at least, had to be made before he could move on Sammael. And that I will do! I have
too much to do yet to let him go on stabbing at my ankles from the bushes! He will find out what it
means to rouse the Dragon!
He did not understand why those coming before him began to sweat and lick their lips as they
knelt and stammered the words of fealty. But then, he could not see the cold light burning in his own
eyes.

CHAPTER
47

The Price of a Ship

Finishing her morning wash, Nynaeve toweled herself dry and pulled on a fresh silk shift
reluctantly. Silk was not as cool as linen, and even with the sun only just up, the heat in the wagon
foretold another scorching day. Besides which, the thing was cut so she was half afraid it would fall
in a puddle around her ankles if she breathed wrong. At least it was not damp with nightsweat, as her
discarded one was.
Disturbing dreams had racked her sleep, dreams of Moghedien that woke her bolt upright—and
those better than the ones she did not wake out of—dreams of Birgitte shooting arrows at her and not
missing, dreams of the Prophet’s followers rioting through the menagerie, of being stranded forever in
Samara because no vessel ever came, of reaching Salidar and finding Elaida in charge. Or
Moghedien again, there, too. She had wakened weeping from that one.
All just worry, of course, and natural enough. Three nights camped here without a ship
appearing, three sweltering days of standing blindfolded against that cursed piece of wall. That was
enough to put anyone on edge, even without worrying whether Moghedien was closing in. But then,
just because the woman knew they were with a menagerie did not mean she had to find them in
Samara. There were other traveling menageries in the world besides those gathered here. Thinking up
reasons not to worry was easier than not worrying, though.
But why should I be anxious about Egwene? Dipping a split twig into a small dish of salt-andsoda on the washstand, she began scrubbing her teeth vigorously. Egwene had popped up in nearly
every dream, yammering at her, but she could not see how Egwene came into them.
In truth, anxiety and lack of sleep were only part of what made her mood vile this morning. The
others were such minor things, but they were realities. A pebble in your shoe was small compared to
having your head cut off, but if the pebble was there and the chopping block might never be . . .
It was not possible to avoid her own reflection, and her hair hanging loose about her shoulders
instead of decently braided. Brush it how she would, the brassy red color never became less
loathsome. And she knew all too well that a blue dress was laid out on the bed behind her. A blue to
make even a Tinker woman blink, and cut as low as the original red gown hanging on a peg. That was
why she had on this precariously clinging shift. One dress like that was not enough, not according to
Valan Luca. Clarine was at work on another pair in a virulent yellow, and there was talk of stripes.
Nynaeve did not want to know about stripes.
At least the man could let me choose the colors, she thought, working the split twig furiously.
Or Clarine. But no, he had his own ideas, and he never asked. Not Valan Luca. His color choices
sometimes made her forget the necklines. I ought to throw it in his face! Yet she knew she would not.
Birgitte flaunted herself in those dresses without the hint of a blush. The woman was certainly

nothing like any of the stories about her! Not that she was going to wear the fool dress without protest
because Birgitte did. She was not competing with the woman in any way. It was just that . . . “If you
have to do a thing,” she growled around the twig, “best you get used it.”
“What did you say?” Elayne asked. “If you’re going to talk, please take that out of your mouth.
The noise is disgusting otherwise.”
Wiping her chin, Nynaeve glared over her shoulder. Elayne was seated on her own narrow bed
with her legs drawn up beside her, braiding her black-dyed hair. She already had on her white
breeches, all sewn with spangles, and a snowy silk blouse with ruffles at the neck that was much too
sheer. Her sequin-splattered white coat lay beside her. White. She also had two suits of clothes for
performing, with a third in the making, all in white, if not exactly plain. “If you are going to dress in
that fashion, Elayne, you should not sit so. It’s indecent.”
The other woman glowered sullenly, but she did put her slippered feet on the floor. And raised
her chin in that haughty way she had. “I think I may take a walk into the town this morning,” she said
coolly, still working at the braid. “This wagon is . . . confining.”
Rinsing her mouth, Nynaeve spat into the washbowl. Loudly. The wagon certainly did seem
smaller by the day. Maybe they did need to keep out of sight as much as possible—it had been her
idea, one she was coming to regret—but this was becoming ridiculous. Three days shut up with
Elayne except when they went to perform was beginning to feel like three weeks. Or three months.
She had never before realized what an acid tongue Elayne had. A ship had to come. Any kind of ship.
She would give every last coin hidden in the brick stove, every last jewel, anything, for a ship today.
“Well, that wouldn’t attract any attention, would it? But perhaps you could use the exercise. Or maybe
it’s just the way those breeches fit your hips.”
Blue eyes flared, but Elayne’s chin remained high and her tone cold. “I dreamed about Egwene
last night, and between going on about Rand and Cairhien—I worry about what is happening there,
even if you do not—in between, she said you were turning into a screaming harridan. Not that I think
so, necessarily. I would have said a fishmonger.”
“Now you listen to me, you ill-tempered little chit! If you don’t—”
Still glaring, Nynaeve snapped her mouth shut, then drew breath slowly. With an effort she
forced her voice to be level. “You dreamed about Egwene?” Elayne nodded curtly. “And she talked
of Rand and Cairhien?” The younger woman rolled her eyes in exaggerated exasperation and went on
with her braid. Nynaeve made her hand loose its fistful of brassy red hair, made herself stop thinking
of teaching the Daughter-Heir of bloody Andor some simple common courtesy. If they did not find a
ship soon . . . “If you can think of anything except how to show more of your legs than you already
are, it might interest you to know that she was in my dreams, too. She said Rand won a great victory
at Cairhien yesterday.”
“I may be exposing my legs,” Elayne barked, spots of color rising in her cheeks, “but at least I
am not flashing my—You dreamed of her, too?”
It did not take long to compare notes, though Elayne continued to show a viperish tongue;
Nynaeve had had a perfectly good reason for screaming at Egwene, and Elayne probably had been
dreaming of parading in front of Rand in her sequined costume, if not less. Saying so was simple
honesty. Even so, it quickly became clear that Egwene had said the same things in both their dreams,
and that left little room for doubt.
“She kept saying she was really there,” Nynaeve muttered, “but I thought it was just part of the
dream.” Egwene had told them often enough that it was possible, talking to someone in her dreams,
but she had never said that she could. “Why should I have believed? I mean, she said she’d finally

recognized some spear he’s taken to carrying as Seanchan work. That’s preposterous.”
“Of course.” Elayne arched one eyebrow in an irritating manner. “Just as preposterous as finding
Cerandin and her s’redit. There must be other Seanchan refugees, Nynaeve, and spears are likely the
least of what they left behind.”
Why could the woman not say anything without a barb? “I notice how well you believed.”
Elayne threw the finished braid over her shoulder, then tossed her head again, superciliously, for
good measure. “I do hope Rand is all right.” Nynaeve sniffed; Egwene had said he would need days
of rest before he was on his feet again but he had been Healed. The other woman continued, “No one
has ever taught him he mustn’t overextend himself. Doesn’t he know the Power can kill him if he
draws too much, or weaves when tired? That much is the same for him as for us.”
So she meant to change the subject, did she? “Perhaps he doesn’t know,” Nynaeve told her
sweetly, “since there isn’t a White Tower for men.” That made her think of something else. “Do you
think it really was Sammael?”
Caught with a retort on the tip of her tongue, Elayne glowered at her sideways, then heaved a
peevish sigh. “It hardly matters to us, does it? What we should be thinking about is using the ring
again. For more than meeting Egwene. There is so much to learn. The more I do learn, the more I
know how much I don’t know yet.”
“No.” Nynaeve did not really expect the other woman to take out the ring ter’angreal then and
there, but she took a reflexive step toward the brick stove. “No more trips to Tel’aran’rhiod, for
either of us, except to meet her.”
Elayne went right on without appearing to notice. Nynaeve could have been talking to herself. “It
isn’t as though we need to channel. We won’t give ourselves away that way.” She did not look at
Nynaeve, but there was a hint of bite in her voice. She maintained that they could use the Power, if
they were careful. For all Nynaeve knew, Elayne did just that behind her back. “I’ll wager if one of
us visited the Heart of the Stone tonight, Egwene would be there. Think, ifwe could talk to her in her
dreams, we’d not need to worry about encountering Moghedien in Tel’aran’rhiod any longer.”
“You think it’s easy to learn, then?” Nynaeve asked dryly. “If that’s so, why hasn’t she taught us
already? Why hasn’t she done it before this?” Her heart was not in it, though. She was the one
worried about Moghedien. Elayne knew the woman was dangerous, but it was like knowing a viper
was dangerous; Elayne knew, but Nynaeve had been bitten. And being able to communicate without
entering the World of Dreams would be valuable quite aside from avoiding Moghedien.
In any case, Elayne still was paying no attention to her. “I wonder why she was so insistent we
not tell anyone. That makes no sense.” For a moment she worried her underlip with her teeth. “There
is another reason to talk to her as soon as we can. It didn’t mean anything to me then, but the last time
she spoke to me, she vanished in midsentence. What I remember now is that before she did, she
suddenly looked surprised, and frightened.”
Nynaeve took a deep breath and pressed both hands hard against her stomach in a vain effort to
quiet sudden flutters. She managed to keep her voice flat, though. “Moghedien?”
“Light, you do have cheerful thoughts! No. If Moghedien could come into our dreams, I think we
would know it by now.” Elayne gave a small shiver; she did have some idea of how dangerous
Moghedien was. “Anyway, it wasn’t that sort of look. She was frightened, but not enough for that.”
“Then maybe she isn’t in any danger. Maybe . . .” Forcing her hands to her sides, Nynaeve
compressed her lips angrily. Only, she was not certain who she was angry with.
Putting the ring away, out of sight, except for meetings with Egwene, had been a good idea. It
had. Any venture into the World of Dreams could have found Moghedien, and keeping clear of her

was better than a good idea. She already knew she was overmatched. That thought rankled, worse
every time she had it, but it was the simple truth.
Yet now there was the chance that Egwene needed help. A small chance. Just because she was
properly wary of Moghedien did not mean she was underrating the possibility. And it might be that
Rand had one of the Forsaken after him in the same personal way that Moghedien was after her and
Elayne. What Egwene reported, both of Cairhien and of the mountains, smacked of one man daring
another to knock a chip off his shoulder. Not that she could see anything to do about that. But Egwene
...
Sometimes it seemed to Nynaeve that she had forgotten why she had left the Two Rivers in the
first place. To protect young people from her village who had been caught in Aes Sedai webs. Not
that much younger than herself—only a few years—yet the gap seemed wider when you were the
village Wisdom. Of course, the Women’s Circle in Emond’s Field had certainly chosen a new
Wisdom by now, but that did not make it less her village, or them less her people. In her heart of
hearts, it made her no less the Wisdom. Somehow, though, protecting Rand and Egwene and Mat and
Perrin from Aes Sedai had become helping them survive, and finally, without her quite realizing when
or how, even that goal had been submerged in other needs. Entering the White Tower to learn how
better to pull down Moiraine had become a burning desire to learn how to Heal. Even her hatred for
Aes Sedai meddling in people’s lives now coexisted with her desire to become one. Not that she
really wanted to, but it was the only way to learn what she wanted to learn. Everything had become as
tangled as one of those Aes Sedai webs, herself included, and she did not know how to escape.
I am still who I always have been, I will help them, as much as I can. “Tonight,” she said
aloud, “I will use the ring.” Sitting down on the bed, she began to pull on her stockings. Stout wool
was hardly comfortable in this heat, but at least part of her would be decently clothed. Stout
stockings, and stout shoes. Birgitte wore brocaded slippers, and gossamer silk stockings that surely
looked cool. She put the thought firmly out of her head. “Just to see if Egwene is in the Stone. If she
isn’t, I will come back, and we won’t use the ring again until the next scheduled meeting.”
Elayne watched her, with an unblinking stare that made her tug at her stockings in increasing
discomfort. The woman did not say a word, but her expressionless gaze implied that Nynaeve might
be lying. To Nynaeve it did. It did not help that the thought had flittered on the edge of consciousness
that she could easily make sure the ring was not touching her skin when she went to sleep; there was
no real reason to believe that Egwene would be waiting in the Heart of the Stone tonight. She had
never really considered it—the thought had drifted up unbidden—but it had been there, and made it
hard to meet Elayne’s eyes. What if she was afraid of Moghedien? It was only good sense, however it
galled to admit it.
I will do what I must. She clamped down firmly on butterflies in the pit of her belly. By the time
she tossed the shift down over her stockings, she was eager to don the blue dress and go out into the
heat just to escape Elayne’s eyes.
Elayne was just finishing helping her with the rows of small buttons up the back—and muttering
that no one had helped her, as if anyone needed help with breeches—when the wagon door banged
open, letting in a wave of hot air. Startled, Nynaeve jumped and covered her bosom with both hands
before she could stop herself. When Birgitte climbed in instead of Valan Luca, she tried to pretend
she was adjusting the neckline.
Smoothing identical brilliant blue silk over her hip, the taller woman pulled her thick black
braid over one bare shoulder with a self-pleased grin. “If you want to draw attention, don’t bother
fiddling. It is too obvious. Just breathe deeply.” She demonstrated, then laughed at Nynaeve’s scowl.

Nynaeve made an effort to keep her temper. Though why she should, she did not know. She
could hardly imagine that she had felt guilt over what had happened. Gaidal Cain was probably glad
to get away from the woman. And Birgitte got to wear her hair the way she wanted. Not that that had
anything to do with anything. “I knew someone like you in the Two Rivers, Maerion. Calle knew
every merchant’s guard by his first name, and she certainly had no secrets from any of them.”
Birgitte’s smile tightened. “And I knew a woman like you, once. Mathena looked down her nose
at men, too, and even had a poor fellow executed for coming on her by accident while she swam
naked. She had never even been kissed, until Zheres stole one from her. You’d have thought she had
discovered men for the first time. She became so besotted, Zheres had to go live on a mountain to
escape her. Watch out for the first man to kiss you. One has to come along sooner or later.”
Fists clenching, Nynaeve took a step toward her. Or tried to. Somehow Elayne was in between
them, hands upraised.
“Both of you stop it this minute,” she said, eyeing them in turn with equal haughtiness. “Lini
always said ‘Waiting turns men into bears in a barn, and women into cats in a sack,’ but you will stop
clawing at one another right now! I will not put up with it any longer!”
To Nynaeve’s surprise, Birgitte actually blushed and mumbled a sullen apology. To Elayne, of
course, but the apology itself was the surprise. Birgitte had chosen to stay close to Elayne—there was
no need for her to hide—but after three days the heat was apparently affecting her as badly as it did
Elayne. For herself, Nynaeve gave the Daughter-Heir her frostiest stare. She had managed to maintain
an even disposition while they waited, cooped up together—she had—but Elayne certainly had no
room to talk.
“Now,” Elayne said, still in that icy tone, “did you have some reason for barging in like a bull,
or have you simply forgotten how to knock?”
Nynaeve opened her mouth to say something about cats—just a gentle reminder—but Birgitte
forestalled her, if in a tighter voice.
“Thom and Juilin are back from the town.”
“Back!” Nynaeve exclaimed, and Birgitte glanced at her before returning to Elayne.
“You did not send them?”
“I did not,” Elayne said grimly.
She was out of the door, Birgitte at her heels, before Nynaeve could say a word. There was
nothing for it but to follow, grumbling to herself. Elayne had better not suddenly think she was the one
giving orders. Nynaeve had still not forgiven her for revealing so much to the men.
The dry heat seemed even worse outside, for all the sun still sat on the canvas wall around the
menagerie. Sweat popped out on her brow before she reached the foot of the ladder, but for once she
did not grimace.
The two men sat on three-legged stools beside the cookfire, hair wild and coats looking as if
they had rolled in the dirt. A trickle of red ran from beneath a wadded cloth Thom was pressing to his
scalp, down across a fan of dried blood that covered his cheek and stained one long white mustache.
A purple lump the size of a hen’s egg stood out beside Juilin’s eye, and he held his thumb-thick staff
of pale ridged wood in a hand roughly wrapped with a bloody bandage. That ridiculous conical red
cap, sitting on the back of his head, appeared to have been trampled.
From the noises inside the canvas walls, the horse handlers were already at work cleaning
cages, and no doubt Cerandin was with her s’redit—none of the men would go near them—but there
was relatively little stir around the wagons as yet. Petra was smoking his long-stemmed pipe while he
helped Clarine prepare their breakfast. Two of the Chavanas were studying some piece of apparatus

with Muelin, the contortionist, while the other pair were chatting with two of the six female acrobats
Luca had hired away from Sillia Cerano’s show. They claimed to be sisters named Murasaka, despite
being even more disparate in looks and coloring than the Chavanas. One of the pair lounging in
colorful silk robes with Brugh and Taeric had blue eyes and almost white hair, the other skin nearly
as dark as her eyes. Everyone else was already garbed for the day’s first performance, the men barechested in colorful breeches, Muelin in gauzy red and a tight matching vest, Clarine in high-necked
green sequins.
Thom and Juilin attracted a few looks, but fortunately no one thought it necessary to come
inquire after their health. Perhaps it was the hangdog way they sat, shoulders slumped, eyes on the
ground under their boots. Doubtless they knew they were in for a tongue-lashing that would sear their
hides. Nynaeve certainly intended to give them one.
Elayne, though, gasped at the sight of them and went running to kneel beside Thom, all the anger
of a moment before taking wing. “What happened? Oh, Thom, your poor head. That must hurt so. This
is beyond my abilities. Nynaeve will take you inside and see to it. Thom, you are too old to get
yourself into scrapes like this.”
Indignantly, he fended her off as best he could while holding his compress in place. “Leave
over, child. I’ve had worse than this falling out of bed. Will you leave over?”
Nynaeve was not about to do any Healing, despite being angry enough. She planted herself in
front of Juilin, fists on her hips and a brook-no-nonsense, answer-me-right-now look on her face.
“What do you mean, sneaking off without telling me?” As well to start letting Elayne know that she
was not in charge. “If you had gotten your throat cut instead of a mouse on your eye, how would we
know what had happened to you? There was no reason for you to go. None! Finding a ship has been
seen to.”
Juilin glared up at her, shoving his cap forward over his forehead. “Seen to, is it? Is that why the
three of you have taken to stalking about like—?” He cut off as Thom groaned loudly and swayed.
Once the old gleeman had quieted Elayne’s concerned flutters with protestations that it had just
been a momentary pang, that he was fit to attend a ball—and given Juilin a significant glance he
obviously hoped the women would not see—Nynaeve turned a dangerous eye back to the dark Tairen,
to learn just what it was he thought they had been stalking about like.
“A good thing we did go,” he told her instead in a tight voice. “Samara’s a school of silverpike
around a chunk of bloody meat. There are mobs on every street hunting Darkfriends and anybody else
who isn’t ready to hail the Prophet as the one true voice of the Dragon Reborn.”
“It started three hours or so ago, near the river,” Thom put in, giving in with a sigh to Elayne’s
bathing his face with a damp cloth. He appeared to be ignoring her mutters, which must have taken
some doing, since Nynaeve could clearly hear “foolish old man” and “need someone to take care of
you before you get yourself killed” among other things in a tone easily as exasperated as it was fond.
“How it began, I don’t know. I heard Aes Sedai blamed, Whitecloaks, Trollocs, everybody but the
Seanchan, and if they knew the name, they’d blame them, too.” He winced at Elayne’s pressure. “The
last hour we were a little too personally involved in getting clear to learn much.”
“There are fires,” Birgitte said. Petra and his wife noticed her pointing and stood to stare
worriedly. Two dark plumes of smoke rose above the canvas wall in the direction of the town.
Juilin rose and looked Nynaeve in the eyes with a hard gaze. “It is time to go. Maybe we’ll stand
out enough for Moghedien to find us, but I doubt it; there are people running every direction they can
run. In another two hours, it won’t be a pair of fires, it will be fifty, and avoiding her won’t do much
good if we’re torn to pieces by a mob. They’ll turn to the shows once they have smashed what can be

smashed in the town.”
“Don’t use that name,” Nynaeve said sharply, with a frown for Elayne that the younger woman
did not see. Letting men know too much was always a mistake. The trouble was, he was right, but
letting a man know that too quickly was a mistake, too. “I will consider your suggestion, Juilin. I
would hate to run away for no reason, and then learn that a ship had come right after we left.” He
stared at her as if she were mad, and Thom shook his head despite Elayne’s holding it still for her
washing, but a figure making his way through the wagons brightened Nynaeve. “Perhaps it’s come
already.”
Uno’s painted eyepatch and scarred face, his topknot and the sword on his back, attracted casual
nods from Petra and the various Chavanas and one shiver from Muelin. He had made each of the
evening visits himself, though with nothing to report. His presence now had to mean there was
something.
As usual he grinned at Birgitte as soon as he saw her, and rolled his lone eye in an ostentatious
stare at her exposed bosom, and as usual she grinned back and eyed him up and down lazily. For
once, though, Nynaeve did not care how reprehensibly they behaved. “Is there a ship?”
Uno’s grin faded. “There’s a bloo—a ship,” he said grimly, “if I can get you to it whole.”
“We know all about the rioting. Surely fifteen Shienarans can get us safely through.”
“You know about the rioting,” he muttered, eyeing Thom and Juilin. “Do you fla—do you know
Masema’s people are fighting Whitecloaks in the streets? Do you know he’s bloo—he’s ordered his
people to take Amadicia with fire and sword? There are thousands across the blo—aagh!—the river
already.”
“That’s as may be,” Nynaeve said firmly, “but I expect you to do as you said you would. You
promised to obey me, if you recall.” She put just a slight emphasis on the word, and gave Elayne a
meaning look.
Pretending not to see, the woman stood, bloodied washcloth in her hand, and directed her
attention to Uno. “I have always been told that Shienarans are among the bravest soldiers in the
world.” That razor edge to her voice had suddenly become regal silk and honey. “I heard many
stories of Shienaran bravery when I was a child.” She rested a hand on Thom’s shoulder, but her eyes
remained on Uno. “I remember them still. I hope I shall always remember them.”
Birgitte stepped closer and began massaging the back of Uno’s neck while she looked him
straight in the eye. That glaring red eye on his eyepatch did not seem to upset her at all. “Three
thousand years guarding the Blight,” she said gently. Gently. It had been two days since she had
spoken to Nynaeve like that! “Three thousand years, and never a step back not paid for ten times over
in blood. This may not be Enkara, or the Soralle Step, but I know what you will do.”
“What did you do,” he growled, “read all the flaming histories of the flaming Borderlands?”
Immediately he flinched and glanced at Nynaeve. It had been necessary to tell him she expected
absolutely clean language out of him. He was not taking it well, but there was no other way to prevent
backsliding, and Birgitte should not frown at her. “Can you talk to them?” he directed at Thom and
Juilin. “They’re fla—fools to try this.”
Juilin flung up his hands, and Thom laughed out loud. “Did you ever know a woman who
listened to sense when she didn’t want to?” the gleeman replied. He grunted as Elayne pulled his
compress away and began dabbing at his split scalp with perhaps a bit more force than was strictly
necessary.
Uno shook his head. “Well, if I’m to be cozened, I suppose I’ll be cozened. But mark this.
Masema’s people found the ship—Riversnake, or something like—not an hour after it docked, but

Whitecloaks seized it. That’s what started this little row. The bad news is the Whitecloaks still hold
the docks. The worse is, Masema may have forgotten the ship—I went to see him, and he wouldn’t
hear of ships; all he can talk about is hanging Whitecloaks, and making Amadicia bend knee to the
Lord Dragon if he has to put the whole land to the torch—but he hasn’t bothered to tell all of his
people. There’s been fighting near the river, and may still be. Getting you through the riots will be
bad enough, but if there’s a battle at the docks, I make no promises. And how I’m to put you on a ship
in Whitecloak hands, I don’t begin to know.” Letting out a long breath, he scrubbed sweat from his
forehead with the back of a scarred hand. The strain of so long a speech without cursing was plain on
his face.
Nynaeve might have relented on his language at that moment—if she had not been too stunned to
speak. It had to be coincidence. Light, I said anything for a ship, but I didn’t mean this. Not this!
She did not know why Elayne and Birgitte were staring at her with such blank expressions. They had
known everything she had, and neither had brought up this possibility. The three men exchanged
frowns, obviously aware that something was going on and just as obviously unaware what it was, for
which thank the Light. Much better when they did not know everything. It just had to be coincidence.
In one way, she was more than happy to focus on another man making his way through the
wagons; it gave an excuse to pull her eyes away from Elayne and Birgitte. In another way, the sight of
Galad made her stomach settle right to her shoes.
He wore plain brown and a flat velvet cap instead of his white cloak and burnished mail, but his
sword still rested on his hip. He had not been to the wagons before, and the effect of his face was
dramatic. Muelin took an unconscious step toward him, and the two slender acrobats leaned forward,
mouths open. The Chavanas were plainly forgotten, and scowling for it. Even Clarine smoothed her
dress as she watched him, until Petra took his pipe from his mouth and said something. Then she went
over to where he sat, laughing, and snuggled his face to her plump bosom. But her eyes still followed
Galad over her husband’s head.
Nynaeve was in no mood to be affected by a handsome face; her breath hardly quickened at all.
“It was you, wasn’t it?” she demanded before he even reached her. “You seized the Riversnake,
didn’t you? Why?”
“Riverserpent,” he corrected, eyeing her incredulously. “You did ask me to secure you
passage.”
“I didn’t ask you to start a riot!”
“A riot?” Elayne put in. “A war. An invasion. All begun over this vessel.”
Galad answered calmly. “I gave Nynaeve my word, sister. My first duty is to see you safely on
your way to Caemlyn. And Nynaeve, of course. The Children would have had to fight this Prophet
soon or late.”
“Couldn’t you simply have let us know the ship was here?” Nynaeve asked wearily. Men and
their word. It was all very admirable, sometimes, but she should have listened when Elayne said he
did what he saw as right no matter who was hurt.
“I don’t know what the Prophet wanted the ship for, but I doubt it was so you could take passage
downriver.” Nynaeve flinched. “Besides which, I paid the captain your passage while he was still
unloading his cargo. An hour later, one of the two men I left to make sure he did not sail without you
came to tell me the other man was dead and the Prophet had taken the ship. I don’t understand what
you are so upset about. You wanted a ship, needed a ship, and I got you one.” Frowning, Galad
addressed Thom and Juilin. “What is the matter with them? Why do they keep staring at one another?”
“Women,” Juilin said simply, and got slapped on the back of the head by Birgitte for his trouble.

He glared at her.
“Horseflies have a nasty bite,” she grinned, and his glower faded into uncertainty as he
readjusted his cap.
“We can sit here all day discussing right and wrong,” Thom said dryly, “or we can take this
vessel. Passage has been paid, and there’s no getting the price back now.”
Nynaeve flinched again. However he meant it, she knew how she heard it.
“There may be trouble reaching the river,” Galad said. “I donned this clothing because the
Children are not popular in Samara at the moment, but the mobs can set on anyone.” He eyed Thom
doubtfully, with his white hair and long white mustaches, and Juilin a little less so—even disheveled,
the Tairen looked hard enough to pound posts—then turned to Uno. “Where is your friend? Another
sword might be useful until we reach my men.”
Uno’s smile was villainous. Clearly, there was no more love between them than at their first
meeting. “He’s about. And maybe one or two more. I’ll see them to the ship, if your Whitecloaks can
hold on to it. Or if they can’t.”
Elayne opened her mouth, but Nynaeve spoke up quickly. “That’s enough, both of you!” Elayne
would just have tried honeyed words again. They might have worked, but she wanted to lash out. At
something, anything. “We need to move quickly.” She should have considered, when she flung two
madmen at the same target, what might happen if they both hit at once. “Uno, gather the rest of your
men, as fast as you can.” He tried to tell her they were already waiting on the other side of the
menagerie, but she plowed on. They were madmen, both of them. All men were! “Galad, you—”
“Rouse and rise!” Luca’s shout cut into her words as he trotted between the wagons, limping,
and with a bruise discoloring the side of his face. His scarlet cape was soiled and torn. It seemed
Thom and Juilin were not the only ones to have entered the town. “Brugh, go tell the horse handlers to
hitch the teams! We’ll have to abandon the canvas,” he grimaced at the words, “but I mean to be on
the road in under an hour! Andaya, Kuan, pull your sisters out! Wake anybody still asleep, and if
they’re washing, tell them to dress dirty or come naked! Hurry, unless you’re ready to proclaim the
Prophet and march to Amadicia! Chin Akima’s lost his head already, along with half his performers,
and Sillia Cerano and a dozen of hers were flogged for being too slow! Move!” By that time,
everybody except those around Nynaeve’s wagon were at the run.
Luca’s limp slowed as he approached, eyeing Galad warily. And Uno, for that matter, though he
had seen the one-eyed man twice before. “Nana, I want to talk to you,” he said quietly. “Alone.”
“We will not be going with you, Master Luca,” she told him.
“Alone,” he said, and seized her arm, hauling her away.
She looked back to tell the others not to interfere and found there was no need. Elayne and
Birgitte were hurrying off toward the canvas wall that encompassed the menagerie, and except for a
few glances at her and Luca, the four men were engrossed in conversation. She sniffed loudly. Fine
men they were, to watch a woman manhandled and do nothing.
Jerking her arm free, she strode along beside Luca, silk skirts swishing her displeasure. “I
suppose you want your money, now that we are going. Well, you shall have it. One hundred gold
marks. Though I think you should allow something for the wagon and horses we’re leaving behind.
And for what we’ve brought in. We have certainly increased the number of your patrons. Morelin and
Juilin with their highwalking, me with the arrows, Thom—”
“Do you think I want the gold, woman?” he demanded rounding on her. “If I did, I’d have asked
for it the day we crossed the river! Have I asked? Did you ever think why not?”
In spite of herself, she took a step back, crossing her arms beneath her breasts sternly. And

immediately wished she had not; that stance more than emphasized what she was exposing.
Stubbornness kept her arms where they were—she was not about to let him think she was flustered,
especially since she was—but surprisingly, his eyes remained on hers. Maybe he was ill. He had
never avoided looking at her bosom before, and if Valan Luca was not interested in bosoms or gold
. . . “If not about the gold, then why do you want to talk to me?”
“All the way back here from the town,” he said slowly, following her, “I kept thinking that now
you would finally go.” She refused to back away again, even when he was standing over her and
staring down intently. At least he was still looking at her face. “I don’t know what you are running
from, Nana. Sometimes, I almost believe your story. Morelin certainly has a noblewoman’s manner
about her, at least. But you were never a lady’s maid. The last few days, I’ve half expected to find the
pair of you rolling on the ground tearing one another’s hair. And maybe Maerion in the pile.” He must
have seen something on her face, because he cleared his throat and hurried on. “The point is, I can
find someone else for Maerion to shoot at. You do scream so beautifully, anyone would think you
were truly terrified, but—” He cleared his throat again, even more hastily, and drew back. “What I
am trying to say is that I want you to stay. There’s a wide world out there, a thousand towns waiting
for a show like mine, and whatever is chasing you will never find you with me. A few of Akima’s
people, and some of Sillia’s who haven’t been marched off across the river—they’re joining me.
Valan Luca’s show will be the greatest the world has ever seen.”
“Stay? Why should I stay? I told you from the first we only wanted to reach Ghealdan, and
nothing has changed.”
“Why? Why, to have my children, of course.” He took one of her hands in both of his. “Nana,
your eyes drink my soul, your lips inflame my heart, your shoulders make my pulse race, your—”
She cut in hurriedly. “You want to marry me?” she said incredulously.
“Marry?” He blinked. “Well . . . uh . . . yes. Yes, of course.” His voice picked up strength again,
and he pressed her fingers to his lips. “We will be wed at the first town where I can arrange it. I’ve
never asked another woman to marry me.”
“I can quite believe it,” she said faintly. It took some effort to pull her hand free. “I am sensible
of the honor, Master Luca, but—”
“Valan, Nana. Valan.”
“But I must decline. I am betrothed to another.” Well, she was, in a way. Lan Mandragoran might
think his signet ring just a gift, but she saw it differently. “And I am going.”
“I should bundle you up and carry you with me.” Dirt and rips somewhat spoiled the
grandiloquent flourish of his cape as he drew himself up. “With time, you would forget the fellow.”
“You try it, and I’ll have Uno make you wish you had been sliced for sausage.” That barely
deflated the fool man at all. She drove a finger hard against his chest. “You do not know me, Valan
Luca. You don’t know anything about me. My enemies, the ones you dismiss so easily, would make
you take off your skin and dance in your bones, and you would be grateful if that was all they did.
Now, I am going, and I don’t have time to listen to your drivel. No, don’t say any more! My mind is
set, and you will not change it, so you might as well stop blathering.”
Luca sighed heavily. “You are the only woman for me, Nana. Let other men choose boring
flutterers with their shy sighs. A man would know he had to walk through fire and tame a lioness with
his bare hands every time he approached you. Every day an adventure, and every night . . .” His smile
almost earned him boxed ears. “I will find you again, Nana, and you will choose me. I know it in
here.” Thumping his chest dramatically, he gave his cape an even more pretentious swirl. “And you
know it, too, my dearest Nana. In your fair heart, you do.”

Nynaeve did not know whether to shake her head or gape. Men were mad. All of them.
He insisted on escorting her back to her wagon, holding her arm as if they were at a ball.
Stalking though the turmoil of horse handlers rushing to hitch teams, the din of men shouting,
horses whickering, bears growling, leopards coughing, Elayne found herself muttering under her
breath to match any of the animals. Nynaeve had no room to talk about her showing her legs. She had
seen the way the woman stood up straighter when Valan Luca appeared. And breathed deeper, too.
For Galad as well, for that matter. It was not as if she enjoyed wearing breeches. They were
comfortable, true, and cooler than skirts. She could see why Min chose to wear men’s clothes.
Almost. There was the problem of getting past the feeling that the coat was really a dress that barely
covered your hips. She had just managed that, so far. Not that she intended to let Nynaeve know, her
and her viperish tongue. The woman should have realized Galad would ignore the cost of keeping his
promise. It was not as if Elayne had not told her about him often enough. And involving the Prophet!
Nynaeve just acted without thinking about what she was doing.
“Did you say something?” Birgitte asked. She had gathered her skirts over one arm to keep up,
unashamedly baring her legs from blue brocaded slippers to well above her knees, and those sheer
silk stockings did not hide as much as breeches.
Elayne stopped dead. “What do you think of how I am dressed?”
“It allows freedom of movement,” the other woman said judiciously. Elayne nodded. “Of course,
it’s good that your bottom isn’t too big, as tight as those—”
Striding on furiously, Elayne tugged the coat down with sharp yanks. Nynaeve’s tongue had
nothing on Birgitte’s. She really should have required some oath of obedience, or at least some show
of proper respect. She would have to remember that once it came time to bond Rand. When Birgitte
caught up to her, wearing a sour expression as if she were driven almost beyond endurance, neither of
them spoke.
Dressed in green sequins, the pale-haired Seanchan woman was using her goad to guide the huge
bull s’redit as his head pushed the heavy wagon holding the black-maned lion’s cage. A horse
handler in a shabby leather vest held the wagon tongue, steering the wagon around to where its horses
could be hitched more easily. The lion stalked back and forth, lashing his tail and now and then giving
a hoarse cough that sounded like the beginning of a roar.
“Cerandin,” Elayne said, “I must speak to you.”
“In a moment, Morelin.” Fixed on the tusked gray animal as she was, her quick, slurred way of
speaking made her nearly unintelligible.
“Now, Cerandin. We have little time.”
But the woman did not halt the s’redit and turn until the horse handler called out that the wagon
was in position. Then she said impatiently, “What do you need, Morelin? I have much to do, yet. And
I would like to change; this dress is not for traveling.” The animal stood waiting patiently behind her.
Elayne’s mouth tightened slightly. “We are leaving, Cerandin.”
“Yes, I know. The riots. Such things should not be allowed. If this Prophet thinks to harm us, he
will learn what Mer and Sanit can do.” She twisted to scratch Mer’s wrinkled shoulder with her
goad, and he touched her shoulder with his long nose. A “trunk,” Cerandin called it. “Some prefer
lopar or grolm for battle, but s’redit properly used—”
“Be quiet and listen,” Elayne said firmly. It was an effort to maintain her dignity, with the
Seanchan woman being obtuse and Birgitte standing aside with her arms folded. She was certain
Birgitte was just waiting to say something else cutting. “I do not mean the show. I mean myself, and

Nana, and you. We are taking ship this morning. In a few hours, we will be beyond the Prophet’s
reach forever.”
Cerandin shook her head slowly. “Few river craft can carry s’redit, Morelin. Even if you’ve
found one that can, what would they do? What would I do? I do not think I can earn as much by myself
as I can with Master Luca, not even with you high walking and Maerion shooting her bow. And I
suppose Thom would juggle. No. No, it is better if we all remain with the show.”
“The s’redit will have to be left behind,” Elayne admitted, “but I am sure that Master Luca will
take care of them. We will not be performing, Cerandin. There’s no more need for that. Where I am
going, there are those who would like to learn about . . .” She was conscious of the horse handler, a
lanky fellow with an incongruously bulbous nose, standing close enough to listen. “About where you
came from. Much more than you’ve told us already.” No, not listening. Leering. By turns at Birgitte’s
bosom and at her legs. She looked at him until his insolent grin turned sickly and he scuttled back to
his duties.
Cerandin was shaking her head again. “I am to leave Mer and Sanit and Nerin to be cared for by
men who are afraid to come near them? No, Morelin. We will stay with Master Luca. You, too. It is
much better. Remember how bedraggled you were the day you came? You do not want to return to
that.”
Drawing a deep breath, Elayne stepped closer. No one but Birgitte was close enough to
overhear, but she did not want to take foolish chances. “Cerandin, my true name is Elayne of House
Trakand, Daughter-Heir of Andor. One day, I will be Queen of Andor.”
Based on the woman’s behavior the first day, and even more on what she had told them of
Seanchan, that should have been enough to quell any resistance. Instead, Cerandin looked her straight
in the eye. “You claimed to be a lady the day you came, but . . .” Pursing her lips, she eyed Elayne’s
breeches. “You are a very good highwalker, Morelin. With practice, you may be good enough to
perform before the Empress one day. Everyone has a place, and everyone belongs in their place.”
For a moment, Elayne’s mouth worked soundlessly. Cerandin did not believe her! “I have
wasted quite enough time, Cerandin.”
She reached for the woman’s arm, to haul her along bodily if necessary, but Cerandin caught her
hand, twisted, and with a wide-eyed yelp Elayne found herself on tiptoe, wondering whether her
wrist would break before her arm came out of her shoulder. Birgitte just stood there, arms folded
under her breasts, and had the nerve to raise an eyebrow questioningly!
Elayne gritted her teeth. She would not ask for help. “Release me, Cerandin,” she demanded,
wishing she did not sound quite so breathy. “I said, release me!”
Cerandin did, after a moment, and stepped back warily. “You are a friend, Morelin, and always
will be. You could be a lady, one day. You have the manner, and if you attract a lord, he may take you
for one of his asa. Asa sometimes become wives. Go with the Light, Morelin. I must finish my work.”
She held out the goad for Mer to curl his trunk around, and the big animal let her lead him
ponderously away.
“Cerandin,” Elayne said sharply. “Cerandin!” The pale-haired woman did not look back. Elayne
glared at Birgitte. “A great lot of help you were,” she growled, and stalked off before the other
woman could reply.
Birgitte caught her up and fell in at her side. “From what I hear, and what I’ve seen, you have
spent considerable time teaching the woman she has a backbone. Did you expect me to help you take
it away from her again?”
“I was not trying to do any such thing,” Elayne muttered. “I was trying to take care of her. She is

a long way from home, a stranger wherever she goes, and there are some who would not treat her
kindly if they learned where she came from.”
“She seems well able to take care of herself,” Birgitte said dryly. “But then, perhaps you taught
her that, too? Perhaps she was helpless before you found her.” Elayne’s stare seemed to slide off her
like ice sliding down warm steel.
“You just stood and watched her. You are supposed to be my . . .” She glanced around; it was
only a glance, but several of the horse handlers ducked their heads away. “My Warder. You are
supposed to help me defend myself when I cannot channel.”
Birgitte looked around, too, but unfortunately there was no one close enough to make her hold
her tongue. “I will defend you when you are in danger, but if the danger is only of being turned over
someone’s knee because you’ve behaved like a spoiled child, I will have to decide whether it’s
better to let you learn a lesson that might save you the same or worse another time. Telling her you
were heir to a throne! Really! If you are going to be Aes Sedai, you had better start practicing how to
bend the truth, not break it into shards.”
Elayne gaped. It was not until she stumbled over her own feet that she managed to say, “But I
am!”
“If you say so,” Birgitte said, rolling her eyes at the spangled breeches.
Elayne could not help herself. Nynaeve wielding her tongue like a needle, Cerandin stubborn as
two mules, and now this. She threw back her head and screamed with frustration.
When the sound died, it seemed as if the animals had quieted. Horse handlers stood about,
staring at her. Coolly, she ignored them. Nothing could worm its way under her skin now. She was as
calm as ice, perfectly in control of herself.
“Was that a cry for help,” Birgitte said, tilting her head, “or are you hungry? I suppose I could
find a wet nurse in—”
Elayne strode away with a snarl that would have done any of the leopards proud.

CHAPTER

Leavetakings

Once she was back in the wagon, Nynaeve changed into a decent dress, with a few
exasperated mutters for having to undo one set of buttons and do up another by herself. The plain gray
wool, fine and well cut yet hardly elaborate, would pass without comment almost anywhere, but it
was decidedly warmer. Still, it felt good to be decently garbed again. And somehow odd, as if she
were wearing too many clothes. It must be the heat.
Quickly she knelt in front of the small brick stove with its tin chimney and opened the iron door
on their valuables.
The twisted stone ring was fast nestled into her belt pouch beside Lan’s heavy signet ring and
her gold Great Serpent. The small gilded coffer containing the gems Amathera had given her went into
the leather scrip with the pouches of herbs taken from Ronde Macura in Mardecin and the small
mortar and pestle for preparing them; she fingered through the latter just to remind herself what each
contained, from healall to that dreadful forkroot. The letters-of-rights went in as well, and three of the
six purses, none quite as fat as it had been after paying the menagerie’s way to Ghealdan. Luca might
not be interested in his hundred marks, but he had had no qualms about collecting his expenses. One
of the letters authorizing the bearer to do whatever she wished in the name of the Amyrlin Seat joined
the rings. No more than vague rumors of some sort of trouble in Tar Valon had reached Samara; she
might find a use for it, even with Siuan Sanche’s signature. The dark wooden box she left where it sat,
next to three of the purses, as well as the rough jute bag containing the a’dam—that, she certainly had
no wish to touch—and the silver arrow Elayne had found the night of the calamitous encounter with
Moghedien.
For a moment she frowned at the arrow, contemplating Moghedien. It was best to do whatever
was necessary to avoid her. It was. I bested her once! And had been hung up like a sausage in the
kitchen the second time. If not for Birgitte . . . She made her own choice. The woman had said so, and
it was true. I could defeat her again. I could. But if I failed . . . If she failed . . .
She was only trying to avoid the washleather purse stuffed right to the back, and she knew it, yet
there was not a hair’s difference for ugliness between the purse and the thought of losing to
Moghedien again. Drawing a deep breath, she gingerly reached in and took it up by the drawstrings,
and knew she had been wrong. Evil seemed to bathe her hand, stronger than ever, as if the Dark One
really was trying to break through the cuendillar seal inside. Better to dwell all day on defeat by
Moghedien; there was a world of difference between thought and reality. It had to be imagination—
there had been no such feeling in Tanchico—but she wished she could let Elayne carry that, too. Or
leave it there.

Stop being foolish, she told herself firmly. It holds the Dark One’s prison shut. You are just
letting your fancies run wild. But she still dropped it like a week-dead rat onto the red dress Luca
had had made, then wrapped and tied the thing securely with more than a little haste. The silken
parcel went into the middle of a bundle of clothes she was taking with her, inside her good gray
traveling cloak. A few inches’ distance was enough to take away the sensation of dark bleakness, but
she still wanted to wash her hand. If only she did not know it was there. She was being foolish.
Elayne would laugh at her, and Birgitte, as well. And rightly.
Actually, the clothes she wanted to keep made two packages, and she regretted every stitch she
had to leave behind. Even the low-cut blue silk. Not that she ever wanted to wear anything like it
again—she did not intend to touch the red dress, certainly, until she handed the intact packet to an
Aes Sedai in Salidar—but she could not help totting up the cost of clothes, horses and wagons
abandoned since leaving Tanchico. And the coach, and the barrels of dye. Even Elayne would have
winced if she had ever thought of it. That young woman believed there would always be coin when
she reached into her purse.
She was still making the second bundle when Elayne returned and silently changed into a blue
silk dress. Silently, except for mutters when she had to double her arms behind her to fasten the
buttons. Nynaeve would have helped, had she been asked, but since she was not, she examined the
other woman for bruises while she changed. She thought she had heard a scream only minutes before
Elayne arrived, and if she and Birgitte had actually come to blows . . . She was not certain she was
glad to find none. A riverboat would be just as confining as this wagon in its own way, and less than
pleasant if the two women were at one another’s throats. But then again, it might have helped had they
worked off some of their beastly tempers.
Elayne said not a word while she gathered her own belongings, not even when Nynaeve asked,
quite amiably, where she had gone haring off to as if she had sat on a cockleburr. That got only a
raised chin and a chilly stare, as though the girl thought she was already on her mother’s throne.
Sometimes Elayne was even more silent, in a way that said far more than words could. Finding
three purses remaining, she paused before taking them, and the temperature in the wagon lowered
considerably, though the purses were only her share. Nynaeve was tired of the carping over how she
doled out coins; let the woman watch them dribble away and realize there might be no more for some
time. When Elayne realized the ring was gone, though, and the dark box still sitting there . . .
Elayne hefted the box and opened the lid, pursing her lips as she studied the contents, the other
two ter’angreal they had carried all the way from Tear. A small iron disc worked on both sides with
a tight spiral, and a narrow plaque five inches long, seemingly amber yet harder than steel, and with a
sleeping woman somehow carved inside it. Either could be used to enter Tel’aran’rhiod, though not
so easily or so well as could the ring; to use either it was necessary to channel Spirit, the sole one of
the Five Powers that could be channeled in sleep. It had seemed only right to Nynaeve, leaving them
for Elayne, since she was taking charge of the ring. Closing the box with a sharp click, Elayne stared
at her, absolutely expressionless, then stuffed it into one of her bundles alongside the silver arrow.
Her silence was thunderous.
Elayne also made two bundles, but hers were larger; she left nothing out except the spangled
coats and breeches. Nynaeve refrained from suggesting that she had overlooked them; she should
have, with the sulking that was going on, but she knew how to promote harmony. She limited herself
to one sniff when Elayne ostentatiously added the a’dam to her things, though from the look she got in
return, you would have thought she had made her objections known at length. By the time they left the
wagon, the quiet could have been chipped and used to chill wine.

Outside, the men were ready. And muttering to themselves, and throwing impatient looks at her
and Elayne. It was hardly fair. Galad and Uno had nothing to prepare. Thom’s flute and harp hung on
his back in leather cases, along with a small bundle, and Juilin, notched sword-breaker at his belt and
leaning on his head-high staff, wore an even smaller bundle, neatly tied. Men were willing to wear
the same clothes until they rotted off.
Of course, Birgitte was ready, too, bow in hand, quiver at her hip, and a cloak-wrapped bundle
at her feet not much smaller than one of Elayne’s. Nynaeve would not have put it past Birgitte to have
Luca’s dresses in there, but it was what she wore that gave a moment’s pause. Her divided skirts
could have been the voluminous trousers she had worn in Tel’aran’rhiod, except for being more gold
than yellow and not being gathered at the ankles. The short blue coat was identical in cut.
The mystery of where the garments had come from was solved when Clarine scurried up,
chattering that she had taken too long, with two more of the skirts and another coat to fold into
Birgitte’s bundle. She stayed to say how sorry she was that they were leaving the show, and she was
not the only one to take a few moments from the bustle of hitching horses and packing up. Aludra
came with wishes for a safe journey, wherever they were going, in her Taraboner accents. And with
two more boxes of her firesticks. Nynaeve tucked them into her scrip with a sigh. She had made a
point of leaving the others behind, and Elayne had pushed them to the back of the shelf, behind a sack
of beans, when she thought Nynaeve was not looking. Petra offered to help escort them to the river,
pretending not to see his wife’s eyes tighten with concern, and so did the Chavanas, and Kin and Bari,
the jugglers, though when Nynaeve told them there was no need, and Petra frowned, they could barely
hide their relief. She had to speak quickly, for Galad and the other men looked on the point of
accepting. Surprisingly, even Latelle appeared briefly, with words of regret, smiles, and eyes that
said she would carry their bundles if it saw them gone any sooner. Nynaeve was surprised Cerandin
did not come, though in a way she was just as glad. Elayne might get on famously with the woman, but
since the incident where she had been assaulted, Nynaeve had felt a tension whenever she was around
her, perhaps the more because Cerandin gave no outward sign of the same.
Luca himself was the last, thrusting a handful of pitiful, drought-dwarfed wildflowers at
Nynaeve—the Light alone knew where he had found them—with protestations of undying love,
extravagant praises for her beauty, and dramatic vows to find her again if he had to travel to the
corners of the world. She was not sure which made her cheeks grow hotter, but her frosty stare wiped
the grin from Juilin’s face and astonishment from Uno’s. Whatever Thom and Galad thought, they had
enough sense to keep their features smooth. She could not make herself look at Birgitte or Elayne.
The worst was that she had to stand there and listen, wilted flowers drooping over her hand, her
face growing redder. Trying to send him away with a flea in his ear would likely only have sparked
him to greater efforts, and given the others more fodder than they already had. She very nearly heaved
a sigh of relief when the idiot man finally bowed himself away in elaborate flourishes of his cape.
She held on to the flowers, striding ahead of the others so she did not have to see their faces and
angrily shoving bundles back into place when they shifted, until she was out of sight of the wagons
around the canvas wall. Then she threw the bedraggled blossoms down so violently that Ragan and
the rest of the rough-clad Shienarans, squatting halfway across the meadow to the road, exchanged
glances. Each had a blanket-wrapped bundle on his back—small, of course!—alongside his sword,
but they were hung about with enough water bottles to last for days, and every third man had a pot or
kettle dangling somewhere. Fine. If there was cooking to be done, let them do it! Not waiting for them
to decide whether she was safe to approach, she stalked out to the dirt road alone.
Valan Luca was the source of her fury—humiliating her that way! She should have thumped his

head and the Dark One take what anyone thought!—but its target was Lan Mandragoran. Lan had
never given her flowers. Not that that was of any account. He had expressed his feelings in words
deeper and more heartfelt than Valan Luca could ever manage. She had meant every word to Luca, but
if Lan said he was going to carry you off, threats would never stop him; channeling would not stop
him unless you managed it before he turned your brain and your knees to jelly with kisses. Still,
flowers would have been nice. Nicer than another explanation of why their love could never be,
certainly. Men and their word! Men and their honor! Wedded to death, was he? Him and his personal
war with the Shadow! He was going to live, he was going to wed her, and if he thought differently on
either point, she intended to set him straight. There was only the small matter of his bond to Moiraine
to deal with. She could have screamed in frustration.
She was a hundred paces down the road before the others caught up, glancing at her sideways.
Elayne only sniffed loudly while struggling to readjust the two large bundles on her back—she would
have to take everything—but Birgitte strode along pretending to speak under her breath yet quite
audibly muttering about women who rushed off like Carpan girls leaping from a river cliff. Nynaeve
ignored them equally.
The men spread out, Galad in the lead flanked by Thom and Juilin, the Shienarans in a long file
to either side, wary eyes searching every withered bush and fold in the ground. Walking in the middle
of them, Nynaeve felt foolish—you would have thought they expected an army to rise up out of the
ground; you would have thought she and the other two women were helpless—especially when the
Shienarans silently followed Uno’s lead and unlimbered their swords. Why, there was not a human
being in sight; even the shanty villages appeared abandoned. Galad’s blade remained in its scabbard,
but Juilin began hefting his thumb-thick staff instead of using it for a walking stick, and knives
appeared in Thom’s hands and vanished as if he was unconscious of what he was doing. Even
Birgitte fitted an arrow to her bow. Nynaeve shook her head. It would take a brave mob to come in
eyeshot of this lot.
Then they reached Samara, and she began to wish she had accepted Petra’s offer, and the
Chavanas’, and anyone else’s she could have found.
The gates stood open and unguarded, and six black columns of smoke rose above the gray town
walls. The streets beyond were still. Shattered glass from broken windows crunched underfoot; that
was the only sound except for a distant buzz, like monstrous swarms of wasps scattered through the
city. Furniture and bits of clothing littered the paving stones, pots and pottery, things dragged from
shops and homes, whether by looters or by people fleeing there was no way to tell.
Not only property had been destroyed. In one place a corpse in a fine green silk coat hung half
out of a window, limp and unmoving; in another a fellow garbed in rags dangled by his neck from the
eaves of a tinsmith’s shop. Sometimes, down a side street or alley, she caught a glimpse of what
might have been discarded bundles of old clothes; she knew they were not.
In one doorway, where the splintered door hung crazily by a single hinge, small flames licked up
around a wooden staircase, smoke just beginning to trickle out. The street might be empty now, but
whoever had done that was not long gone. Head swiveling, trying to watch every way at once,
Nynaeve took a firm hold on her belt knife.
Sometimes the angry buzz grew louder, a wordless guttural roar of rage that seemed no more
than one street over, and sometimes it faded to a dull murmur; yet when trouble came, it came
suddenly and silently. The mass of men stalked around the next corner but one, like a pack of hunting
wolves, jamming the street from side to side, soundless but for the thud of boots. The sight of
Nynaeve and the others was a torch tossed into a haystack. There was no hesitation; as one they

surged forward, howling and rabid, waving pitchforks and swords, axes and clubs, anything that
could be taken to hand for a weapon.
Enough anger still clung in Nynaeve for her to embrace saidar, and she did it without thinking,
even before she saw the glow spring up around Elayne. There were a dozen ways she could halt this
mob by herself, a dozen more she could destroy it if she chose. If not for the possibility of
Moghedien. She was not sure whether the same thought held Elayne. She only knew that she hung on
to her anger and the True Source with equal fervor, and it was Moghedien more than the onrushing
rabble that made it hard. She hung on to them, and knew she dared do nothing. Not if there was any
other chance. Almost, she wished she could cut the flows being woven by Elayne. There had to be
some other chance.
One man, a tall fellow in a ragged red coat that had belonged to someone else once by its greenand-gold embroidery, ran out in front of the others on long legs, shaking a wood-axe overhead.
Birgitte’s arrow took him through one eye. He went down in a sprawling heap and was trampled by
the others, all contorted faces and wordless screams. Nothing was going to stop them. With a wail,
half outrage, half pure fear, Nynaeve jerked her belt knife free and at the same time prepared to
channel.
Like a wave striking boulders, the charge splintered on Shienaran steel. The top-knotted men, not
much less ragged than those they fought, worked their two-handed swords methodically, craftsmen at
their craft, and the onslaught went no farther than their thin line. Men fell screaming for the Prophet,
but more scrambled over them. Juilin, the fool, was in that row, flat-topped conical cap perched on
his dark head, thin staff a blur that deflected stabs, broke arms and cracked skulls. Thom worked
behind the line, his limp strong as he darted from place to place to confront the few who managed to
wriggle through; only a dagger in either hand, yet even swordsmen died on those blades. The
gleeman’s leathery face was grim, but when one bulky fellow in a blacksmith’s leather vest nearly
reached Elayne with his pitchfork, Thom snarled as viciously as any in the mob and very nearly cut
the man’s head off while slitting his throat. Through it all Birgitte calmly shifted from spot to spot,
every arrow finding an eye.
Yet if they held the mob, it was Galad who broke them. He faced their charge as though awaiting
the next dance at a ball, arms folded and unconcerned, not even bothering to bare his blade until they
were almost on top of him. Then he did dance, all his grace turned in an instant to fluid death. He did
not stand against them; he carved a path into their heart, a clear swath as wide as his sword’s reach.
Sometimes five or six men closed in around him with swords and axes and table legs for clubs, but
only for the brief time it took them to die. In the end, all their rage, all their thirst for blood, could not
face him. It was from him that the first ran, flinging away weapons, and when the rest fled, they
divided around him. As they vanished back the way they had come, he stood twenty paces from
anyone else, alone among the dead and the groans of the dying.
Nynaeve shivered as he bent to clean his blade on a corpse’s coat. He was graceful, even doing
that. He was beautiful, even doing that. She thought she might sick up.
She had no idea how long it had taken. Some of the Shienarans were leaning on their swords,
panting. And eyeing Galad with a good deal of respect. Thom was bent over with one hand on his
knee, trying to fend Elayne off with the other while telling her he just had to catch his breath. Minutes,
an hour; it could have been either.
For once, looking at the injured men lying on the pavement here and there, the one crawling
away, she felt no desire to Heal, no pity at all. Not far off was a pitchfork, where someone had flung
it; a man’s severed head was impaled on one tine, a woman’s on another. All she felt was queasy, and

grateful that it was not her head. That, and cold.
“Thank you,” she said aloud, to no one in particular and to everyone. “Thank you very much.”
The words grated a little—she did not like confessing something she had not been able to do for
herself—but they were fervent. Then Birgitte nodded in acknowledgment, and Nynaeve had to
struggle with herself. But the woman had done as much as anyone. Considerably more than she
herself. She thrust her belt knife back into its sheath. “You . . . shot very well.”
With a wry grin, as if she knew exactly how difficult those words had been, Birgitte set about
recovering her arrows. Nynaeve shuddered and tried not to watch.
Most of the Shienarans had wounds, and Thom and Juilin both wore their own blood in places—
miraculously, Galad was untouched; or perhaps not so miraculously, remembering how he had
handled his sword—but, manlike to the bitter end, every one of them insisted that his hurts were not
serious. Even Uno said they had to keep moving, him with one arm hanging and a gash down the side
of his face whose scar would nearly mirror the first if it was not Healed soon.
In truth, she was not reluctant to go, despite telling herself that she should be seeing to injuries.
Elayne put a supporting arm around Thom; he responded by refusing to lean on her and beginning to
recite a tale in High Chant, so flowery it was difficult to recognize the story of Kirukan, the beautiful
soldier queen of the Trolloc Wars.
“She had a temper like a boar caught in briars at the best,” Birgitte said softly to no one in
particular. “Not at all like anyone close by.”
Nynaeve ground her teeth. Catch her complimenting the woman again, no matter what she did.
Come to think of it, any man in the Two Rivers could have shot as well at that range. Any boy.
Rumbles followed them, distant roars from other streets, and often she had the feeling of eyes
watching from one of the vacant, glassless windows. But word must have spread, or else the watchers
had seen what happened, because they saw no one else living until suddenly two dozen Whitecloaks
stepped into the street in front of them, half with drawn bows, the rest with bared blades. The
Shienarans’ blades were up in a heartbeat.
Quick words between Galad and a fellow with a grizzled face beneath his conical helmet passed
them through, though the man did eye the Shienarans doubtfully, and Thom and Juilin, and for that
matter Birgitte. It was enough to rankle Nynaeve. All very well for Elayne to march along with her
chin raised, ignoring the Whitecloaks as though they were servants, but Nynaeve did not like being
taken for granted.
The river was not far. Beyond a few small stone warehouses under slate roofs, the town’s three
stone docks barely reached water over the dried mud. A fat vessel with two masts sat low at the end
of one. Nynaeve hoped there would be no problem obtaining separate cabins. She hoped it would not
heave too badly.
A small crowd huddled twenty paces from the dock, under the watchful eyes of four whitecloaked guards; nearly a dozen men, mainly old and all ragged and bruised, and twice as many
women, most with two or three children clinging to them, some with a babe in arms beside. Two
more Whitecloaks stood right at the dock. The children hid their faces in their mothers’ skirts, but the
adults gazed yearningly at the ship. The sight wrenched at Nynaeve’s heart; she remembered the same
gazes, many more of them, in Tanchico. People desperately hoping for a way to safety. She had not
been able to do anything for those.
Before she could do anything for these, Galad had seized her and Elayne by the arm and hustled
them along the dock and down an unsteady gangplank. Six more stern-faced men in white cloaks and
burnished mail stood on the deck, watching a cluster of barefoot and mostly bare-chested men

squatting in the bluff bows. It was close whether the captain at the foot of the plank gazed at the
Whitecloaks more sourly or at the motley party that trooped onto his ship.
Agni Neres was a tall, bony man in a dark coat, with ears that stood out and a dour cast to his
narrow face. He paid no mind to the sweat rolling down his cheeks. “You paid me passage for two
women. I suppose you want me to take the other wench and the men for free?” Birgitte eyed him
dangerously, but he seemed not to see.
“You shall have your fare money, my good captain,” Elayne told him coolly.
“As long as it’s reasonable,” Nynaeve said, and ignored Elayne’s sharp glance.
Neres’ mouth thinned, though it hardly seemed possible, and he addressed Galad again. “Then if
you’ll get your men off my craft, I’ll sail. I like being here in daylight now less than ever.”
“As soon as you take your other passengers on,” Nynaeve said, nodding to the people huddled
ashore.
Neres looked for Galad only to find that he had moved away to speak with the other
Whitecloaks, then eyed the folk ashore and spoke to the air above Nynaeve’s head. “Any who can
pay. Not many in that lot look like they can. And I could not take the lot if they could.”
She raised herself on tiptoe, so he could not possibly miss her smile. It snapped his chin down
into his collar. “Every last one of them, Captain. Else I’ll shave your ears off for you.”
The man’s mouth opened angrily; then abruptly his eyes widened, staring past her. “All right,” he
said quickly. “But I expect some sort of payment, mind. I give alms on Firstday, and that’s long past.”
Heels settling back to the deck, she looked over her shoulder suspiciously. Thom, Juilin and Uno
stood there, blandly watching her and Neres. As blandly as they could manage with Uno’s features,
and blood all over their faces. Far too blandly.
With a sharp sniff, she said, “I will see them all aboard before anybody touches a rope,” and
went in search of Galad. She supposed he deserved some thanks. He had thought what he was doing
was the right thing. That was the trouble with the best of men. They always thought they were doing
the right thing. Still, whatever the three had done, they had saved argument.
She found him with Elayne, that handsome face painted with frustration. He brightened at the
sight of her. “Nynaeve, I’ve paid your way as far as Boannda. That’s only halfway to Altara, where
the Boern runs into the Eldar, but I could not afford to pay further. Captain Neres took every copper in
my purse, and I had to borrow besides. The fellow charges ten prices. I’m afraid you will have to
make your own way to Caemlyn from there. I truly am sorry.”
“You have done quite enough already,” Elayne put in, her eyes drifting toward the plumes of
smoke rising above Samara.
“I gave my promise,” he said with a weary resignation. Plainly they had had the same exchange
before Nynaeve came.
Nynaeve managed to offer her thanks, which he dismissed graciously, but with a look as if she,
too, did not understand. And she was more than ready to admit as much. He started a war to keep a
promise—Elayne was right about that; it would be a war, if it was not already—yet, with his men
holding Neres’ ship, he would not demand a better price. It was Neres’ ship, and Neres could charge
as he chose. As long as he took Elayne and Nynaeve. It was true: Galad never counted the cost of
doing right, not to himself or anyone else.
At the gangplank, he paused, staring at the town as if seeing the future. “Stay clear of Rand
al’Thor,” he said bleakly. “He brings destruction. He will break the world again before he is done.
Stay clear of him.” And he was trotting up to the dock, already calling for his armor.
Nynaeve found herself sharing a wondering gaze with Elayne, though it quickly broke up in

embarrassment. It was hard to share a moment like that with someone you knew might rake you with
her tongue. At least, that was why she felt discomfited; why Elayne should look flustered, she could
not imagine, unless the woman was starting to come to her senses. Surely Galad did not suspect they
had no intention of going to Caemlyn. Surely not. Men were never that perceptive. She and Elayne did
not look at one another again for some time.

CHAPTER
49

To Boannda

There was little trouble getting the huddled crowd of men, women and children aboard. Not
once Nynaeve made it clear to Captain Neres that he was going to find room for everyone and
whatever he thought he was going to charge, she knew exactly how much she would give for their
fares to Boannda. Of course, it might have helped a little that she’d taken the precaution of quietly
telling Uno to have the Shienarans do something with their swords. Fifteen hard-faced, rough-dressed
men, all with shaved heads and topknots not to mention bloodstains, oiling and sharpening blades,
laughing as one recounted how another had almost been spitted like a lamb—well, they had a most
salutary effect. She counted the money into his hand, and if it pained her, she only had to summon the
memory of those docks at Tanchico to keep counting. Neres was right in one thing: These folk did not
look to have much coin; they would need whatever coppers they had. Elayne had no call to ask in that
sickly sweet tone if she was having a tooth pulled.
The crew ran at Neres’ shouted commands to cast off while the last of the people were still
scrambling aboard carrying their wretched possessions in their arms, those who had anything at all
beyond the rags on their backs. In truth, they crowded even the fat vessel so that Nynaeve began to
wonder whether Neres had been right about that, too. Yet such hope dawned on their faces once their
feet were firmly on the deck that she was embarrassed to have considered it. And when they learned
she had paid their passage, they clustered around her, struggling to kiss her hands, the hem of her
skirt, crying out thanks and blessings, some with tears streaming down dirty cheeks, men as well as
women. She wished she could sink through the planks under her feet.
The decks bustled as sweeps went out and sails rose, and Samara began to dwindle behind
before she could put an end to the demonstration completely. If Elayne or Birgitte had said one word,
she would have thumped them both twice around the ship for good measure.
Five days they were on Riverserpent, five days running down the slowly winding Eldar through
baking days and nights not much cooler. Some things changed for the better in that time, but the voyage
did not begin well.
The first real problem of the trip was Neres’ cabin in the stern, the only accommodation on the
ship except the deck. Not that Neres was reluctant about moving out. His haste—breeches and coats
and shirts flung over his shoulders and dangling from a great wad in his arms, shaving mug clutched in
one hand and razor in the other—made Nynaeve look hard at Thom and Juilin and Uno. It was one
thing for her to make use of them when she chose to, quite another for them to go looking after her
behind her back. Their faces could not have been more open, or their eyes more innocent. Elayne
brought up another of Lini’s sayings. “An open sack hides nothing, and an open door hides little, but
an open man is surely hiding something.”

But whatever problem the men might prove to be, the problem now was the cabin itself. It
smelled of must and mold even with the tiny windows swung out, and they let little light into its dank
confines. “Confines” was the word. The cabin was small, smaller than the wagon, and most of the
space was taken by a heavy table and high-backed chair fastened to the floor, and the ladder leading
up to the deck. A washstand built into the wall, with a grimy pitcher and bowl and a narrow dusty
mirror, crowded the room still more, and completed the furnishings except for a few empty shelves
and pegs for hanging clothes. The ceiling beams crouched right overhead, even for them. And there
was only one bed, wider than what they had been sleeping on, yet hardly wide enough for two. Tall as
he was, Neres might as well have lived in a box. The man surely had not given up one inch that might
be stuffed with cargo.
“He came to Samara in the night,” Elayne muttered, unburdening herself of her bundles and
putting hands on hips as she looked around disparagingly, “and he wanted to leave in the night. I
heard him tell one of his men that he meant to sail on through the night whatever the . . . the wenches
. . . wanted. Apparently, he’s not much pleased to be moving in daylight.”
Thinking of the other woman’s elbows and cold feet, Nynaeve wondered whether she would not
have done better to sleep up above with the refugees. “What are you going on about?”
“The man is a smuggler, Nynaeve.”
“In this vessel?” Dropping her own bundles, Nynaeve laid the scrip on the table and sat down
on the edge of the bed. No, she would not sleep on deck. The cabin might smell, but it could be aired
out, and if the bed was cramped, it had a thick feather mattress. The ship did roll disturbingly; she
might as well have what comfort she could. Elayne could not chase her out of there. “It is a barrel.
We will be lucky to reach Boannda in two weeks. The Light alone knows how long to Salidar.”
Neither of them really knew how far Salidar was, and it was not yet time to broach the matter with
Captain Neres.
“Everything fits. Even the name. Riverserpent. What honest trader would name his craft so?”
“Well, what if he is? It wouldn’t be the first time we’ve made use of a smuggler.”
Elayne threw up her hands in exasperation; she always did think obeying the law was important,
however fool the law was. She shared more with Galad than she would be willing to admit. So Neres
had called them wenches, had he?
The second difficulty was room for the others. Riverserpent was not a very large vessel, if
wide, and counting everyone there were well over a hundred people aboard. A certain amount of
space had to go to the crew working the sweeps and tending ropes and sails, and that did not leave
much for the passengers. It did not help that the refugees kept as far from the Shienarans as possible; it
seemed they had had their fill of armed men. There was scarcely room for everyone to sit, and none
for lying down.
Nynaeve approached Neres straight away. “These folk need more room. Especially the women
and children. Since you have no more cabins, your hold will have to do.”
Neres’ face darkened. Staring straight ahead, somewhere a pace to her left, he growled, “My
hold is full of valuable cargo. Very valuable cargo.”
“I wonder if customs men are active along the Eldar here?” Elayne said idly, eyeing the treelined banks to either side. The river was only a few hundred paces wide here, bordered with dried
black mud and bare yellow clay. “Ghealdan to one side and Amadicia to the other. It might seem odd,
your hold full of goods from the south and you heading south. Of course, you probably have all the
documents showing where you’ve paid duties. And you could explain that you didn’t unload because
of the troubles in Samara. I have heard that excise men are quite understanding, really.”

The corners of his mouth turning down, he still did not look at either of them.
Which was why he had a very good view when Thom fanned empty hands, made a flourish, and
was suddenly twirling a pair of knives through his fingers before making one of them disappear.
“Just keeping in practice,” Thom said, scratching one long mustache with the other blade. “I like
to maintain certain . . . skills.” The gash in his white-haired scalp and the fresh blood on his face,
added to a bloodstained rent in one shoulder of his coat and tears elsewhere besides, made him look
villainous in any company but Uno’s. The Shienaran’s toothy smile held no mirth at all, and did
unfortunate things to his long scar and the new slash down his face, red and raw. The glaring crimson
eye on his patch almost paled in comparison.
Neres shut his eyes and drew a long, long breath.
The hatches came open, and crates and casks went splashing over the side, some heavy, most
light and smelling of spices. Neres winced every time the river closed over something else. He
brightened—if such a thing could be said of him—when Nynaeve directed that bolts of silk and
carpets and bales of fine woolens be left below. Until he realized that she meant them for bedding. If
his face had been sour before, now it could have curdled milk in the next room. Through the whole
thing he never said a word. When women began drawing up buckets of water on ropes to wash their
children right there on the deck, he strode to the stern, hands clenched behind his back, and stared at
the few floating casks as they fell behind.
In a way, it was Neres’ peculiar attitude toward women that began smoothing the edges from
Elayne’s acid tongue, and Birgitte’s. That was the way Nynaeve saw it; she herself had maintained
her usual even disposition, of course. Neres disliked women. The crew spoke quickly when they had
to speak to one of the women, all the while darting glances at the captain until they could hurry back
to their duties. A fellow who seemed to have nothing to do for a moment was more likely than not to
be sent running to some task by a roar from Neres if he exchanged two words with anyone in skirts.
Their hasty comments and muttered warnings made Neres’ opinions perfectly clear.
Women cost a man money, they fought like alley cats, and they caused trouble. Any and all
trouble a man had could be laid to women, one way or another. Neres expected half of them to be
rolling on the deck clawing one another before the first sunset. They would all flirt with his crew, and
bring on dissension where they did not cause fights. Could he have sent all women off his ship,
forever, he might have been happy. Could he have had them out of his life, he would have been
ecstatic.
Nynaeve had never encountered the like. Oh, she had heard men mutter about women and money,
as if men did not fling coin about like water—they just had no head for money, less than Elayne—and
she had even heard them lay various troubles to women, usually when it was they themselves who had
caused all the bother. But she could not recall ever meeting a man who truly disliked women. It was a
surprise to learn that Neres had a wife and a horde of children in Ebou Dar, but no surprise that he
stayed at home only long enough to load a new cargo. He did not even want to talk to a woman. It was
simply amazing. Sometimes Nynaeve found herself looking at him sideways, the way she would have
at some incredible animal. Far stranger than s’redit, or anything else in Luca’s menagerie.
Naturally, there was no way that Elayne or Birgitte could vent their bile where he might hear.
Rolling eyes and meaningful looks among Thom and the others were bad enough; they at least made
some effort to hide them. Neres’ open satisfaction at having his ridiculous expectations met—he
surely would have seen it so—that would have been unbearable. He left them no choice but to
swallow their acid and smile.
For herself, Nynaeve could have done with a little time with Thom and Uno and Juilin away

from Neres’ eye. They were forgetting themselves again, forgetting they were supposed to do as they
were told. The results did not matter; they should wait. And for some reason they had taken to
tormenting Neres with darkly smiling comments about cracking heads and slitting throats. But the only
place she could be sure of avoiding Neres was in the cabin. They were not particularly large men,
though Thom was tall and Uno fairly wide, yet crowded in there, they would have filled the tiny space
to where they were looming over her. Hardly conducive to the tongue-lashing she wanted to hand out;
give a man the chance to loom, and he had the battle half won. So she put on a pleasant mask, ignored
startled frowns from Thom and Juilin, incredulous stares from Uno and Ragan, and enjoyed the
outward good temper the other women had been forced to adopt.
She managed to keep smiling when she learned why the sails were so full, the undulating
riverbanks rushing by under the afternoon as fast as a trotting horse. Neres had had the sweeps pulled
in and stored along the railings; he almost looked happy. Almost. A low clay bluff ran along the
Amadicia bank: on the Ghealdan side lay a broad ribbon of reeds between river and trees, mainly
brown where water had receded. Samara lay only a few hours upriver.
“You channeled,” she said to Elayne through her teeth. Wiping sweat from her brow with the
back of her hand, she resisted the urge to dash it to the slowly heaving deck. The other passengers left
a clear space for the two of them and Birgitte a few paces across, but she still kept her voice low, and
as affable as she could manage. Her stomach seemed to move a heartbeat behind the ship’s roll; that
hardly improved her temper. “This wind is your doing.” She hoped there was enough red fennel in her
scrip.
From Elayne’s damply glowing countenance and wide eyes, milk and honey should have
fountained from her mouth. “You are turning into a frightened rabbit. Pull yourself together. Samara is
miles behind us. No one could sense anything useful from that far. She would have to be on the ship
with us to know. I was very quick.”
Nynaeve thought her own face might crack if she held her smile any longer, but out of the corner
of her eye she could see Neres, studying his passengers and shaking his head. Angry as she was at that
moment, she could also see the almost faded residue of the other woman’s weaving. Working weather
was like rolling a stone downhill; it tended to keep going the way you started it. When it bounced
away from the path, as it would sooner or later, you just had to twitch it back. Moghedien might have
felt a weave of that size from Samara—maybe—but certainly not well enough to say where it had
been done. She herself was a match for Moghedien in raw strength, and if she was not strong enough
to do something, it seemed safe to say the Forsaken was not either. And she did want to travel as
quickly as possible; right then, one day more than necessary in close quarters with the other two held
as much attraction for her as sharing the cabin with Neres. For that matter, an extra day on water was
nothing to look forward to. How could a ship move in such a fashion when the river looked so flat?
Smiling was beginning to make her lips ache. “You should have asked, Elayne. You always go
and do things without asking, without thinking. It’s time you realized if you fall into a hole running
blindly, your old nurse isn’t going to come pick you up and wash your face.” By the last word,
Elayne’s eyes were as round as teacups, and her bared teeth looked ready to bite.
Birgitte put a hand on each of them, leaning close and beaming as though joy had her by the
throat. “If you two don’t stop this, I’m going to tip you both into the river to cool off. You are both
acting like Shago barmaids with winteritch!”
Sweating faces frozen in amiability, the three women stalked in different directions, just as far
apart as the ship would allow. Near sunset Nynaeve heard Ragan say that she and the others must
really be relieved to be away from Samara, the way they were all but laughing on one another’s

shoulder, and the other men seemed to be thinking much the same, but the rest of the women aboard
watched them with faces much too smooth. They knew trouble when they saw it.
Yet bit by bit, that trouble oozed away. Nynaeve was not exactly sure how. Perhaps the pleasant
exteriors Elayne and Birgitte put on just seeped inside in spite of them. Perhaps the ridiculousness of
it all, trying to keep a friendly smile on your face while putting a proper bite into your words, struck
them more and more. Whatever did it, she could not complain at the outcome. Slowly, day by day,
words and tones began to match faces, and now and then one of them even looked embarrassed,
plainly remembering how she had been behaving. Neither spoke one word of apology, of course,
which Nynaeve quite understood. Had she been as foolish and vicious as they, she certainly would
not want to remind anyone.
The children played a part in restoring Elayne and Birgitte to equilibrium, too, though it actually
started with Nynaeve looking after the men’s wounds that first morning on the river. She brought out
her scrip full of herbs, making poultices and ointments, bandaging cuts. Those gashes made her angry
enough to Heal—sickness and injury always made her angry—and she did so, for some of the worst,
though she had to be careful. Wounds vanishing would have set people talking, and the Light knew
what Neres would do if he thought he had an Aes Sedai aboard; very likely sneak a man ashore in
Amadicia by night and try to have them arrested. For that matter, the news might have sent some of the
refugees over the side.
With Uno, for example, she rubbed a touch of stinging mardroot-oil liniment into his heavily
bruised shoulder, dabbed a bit of healall ointment on the fresh slash down his face—no point wasting
either—and wrapped his head in bandages until he could hardly move his jaw before Healing him.
When he gasped and flailed, she said briskly, “Don’t be such a baby. I wouldn’t have thought a little
pain would bother a big strong man. Now, you leave those alone; if you even touch them in the next
three days, I’ll dose you with something you won’t soon forget.”
He nodded slowly, staring at her so uncertainly that it was plain he did not know what she had
done. If he realized when he finally took the bandages off, with luck no one else would remember
exactly how bad the gash had been, and he should have sense enough to keep his mouth shut.
Once she began, it was only natural to go on to the rest of the passengers. Few of the refugees
lacked bruises and scrapes, and some of the children were showing signs of fevers or worms. Those
she could Heal without worry; children always made a fuss when they were dosed with anything that
did not taste of honey. If they told their mothers it had felt odd, children always had fancies.
She had never really been comfortable around children. True, she wanted to have Lan’s babies.
Part of her did. Children could make a mess from nothing. They seemed to have the habit of doing the
opposite of what you told them as soon as your back was turned, just to see how you would react. Yet
she found herself smoothing back the dark hair of a boy no higher than her waist who stared up at her
owlishly with bright blue eyes. They looked very like Lan’s eyes.
Elayne and Birgitte joined her, just to help keep order at first, but one way or another they
gravitated to the children, too. Strangely, Birgitte did not look at all silly with a boy of three or four
cradled on either hip and a ring of children about her, singing them a nonsense song about dancing
animals. And Elayne handed round a sack of sweet red candies. The Light knew where she had gotten
them, or why. She did not look guilty at all when Nynaeve caught her sneaking one into her own
mouth; she only grinned, gently pulled a little girl’s thumb from her mouth and replaced it with
another candy. The children laughed as if just remembering how, and snuggled themselves into
Nynaeve’s skirts, or Elayne’s or Birgitte’s, as easily as into their mothers’. It was very difficult to
maintain any sort of temper in those circumstances. She could not even bring herself to do more than

sniff, and that faintly, when Elayne resumed her study of the a’dam in the privacy of the cabin on the
second day. The woman seemed more convinced than ever that the bracelet, necklace and leash
created a strange form of linking. Nynaeve even sat with her once or twice; the sight of the vile thing
itself was enough to enable her to embrace saidar and follow along.
The refugees’ stories came out, of course. Families separated, lost or dead. Farms and shops and
crafts ruined as ripples of the world’s troubles spread out, disrupting trade. People could not buy
when they could not sell. The Prophet had only been the last brick on the cart that broke the axle.
Nynaeve said nothing when she saw Elayne slipping a gold mark to a fellow with thin gray hair who
knuckled a wrinkled forehead and tried to kiss her hand. She would learn how fast gold vanished.
Besides, Nynaeve had handed out a few coins herself. Well, perhaps more than a few.
All but two of the men were grizzled or balding, with leathery faces and work-callused hands.
Younger men had been snatched into the army if they were not caught up by the Prophet; those who
refused one or the other had been hanged. The young pair—little more than boys, really; Nynaeve
doubted if either had to shave regularly—wore hunted stares, and flinched if one of the Shienarans
looked at them. Sometimes the older men talked of starting over, finding a bit of land to farm or taking
up their trade again, but the tone of their voices said it was more bluff and bravado than real hope.
Mostly they talked quietly of their families; a wife lost, sons and daughters lost, grandchildren lost.
They sounded lost. The second night, a jug-eared fellow who had seemed the most enthusiastic in a
sad lot had just vanished; he was simply gone when the sun came up. He might have swum ashore.
Nynaeve hoped he had.
Still, it was the women who caught her heart. They had no more prospects than the men, no more
certainties, but most had more burdens. None had a husband with her, or even knew if she had a
husband alive, yet the responsibilities that weighed them down also kept them moving. No woman
with grit could give up when she had children. Even the others meant to find some future, though.
They all had at least a scrap of the hope the men only pretended to. Three especially tugged at her.
Nicola was about her age and height, a slender dark-haired weaver with big eyes who had been
intending to marry. Until her Hyran took it into his head that duty called him to follow the Prophet, to
follow the Dragon Reborn; he would marry her when his duty was seen to. Duty had been very
important to Hyran. He would have made a good and conscientious husband and father, so Nicola
said. Only, whatever was in his head had not done him much good when someone split it with an axe.
Nicola did not know who, or why, just that she had to get as far from the Prophet as she could.
Somewhere, there had to be a place where there was no killing, where she would not always be in
fear of what might be around the next corner.
Marigan, a few years older, had been plump once, but her frayed brown dress hung on her
loosely now, and her blunt face looked beyond weary. Her two sons, six and seven, stared silently at
the world with too-big eyes; clinging to each other, they seemed frightened of everything and
everyone else, even their own mother. Marigan had dealt in cures and herbs in Samara, though she
had some odd ideas about both. That was no wonder, really; a woman who offered healing with
Amadicia and Whitecloaks right across the river had to keep low, and even from the first she had had
to teach herself. All she had ever wanted to do was cure sickness, and she claimed to have done it
well, though she had not been able to save her husband. The five years since his death had been hard,
and the coming of the Prophet had certainly not helped her any. Mobs searching for Aes Sedai chased
her into hiding after she had cured a man of fever and rumor had turned it into bringing him back from
the dead. That was how little most people knew of Aes Sedai; death was beyond the power to Heal.
Even Marigan seemed to think it was not. She did not know where she was going any more than

Nicola. A village somewhere, she hoped, where she could dispense herbs again in peace.
Areina was the youngest of the three, with steady blue eyes in a face bruised purple and yellow,
and not from Ghealdan at all. Her clothes would have said that if nothing else did, a short dark coat
and voluminous trousers not much different from Birgitte’s. They were the sum of her possessions.
She would not say where she was from exactly, but she was forthcoming about the road that had led
her to Riverserpent. About some of it; Nynaeve had to infer in places. Areina had gone to Illian
meaning to bring her younger brother home before he could take the oath as a Hunter for the Horn.
With thousands in the city, however, she had never found him, but somehow she had found herself
taking the oath, setting out to see the world while not quite believing the Horn of Valere existed, half
hoping that somewhere she would find young Gwil and take him home. Things had been . . . difficult
. . . since. Areina was not precisely reluctant to talk, but she made such an effort to put a good face on
things. . . . She had been chased out of several villages, robbed once, and beaten several times. Even
so, she had no intention of giving up or seeking sanctuary, or a peaceful village. The world was still
out there, and Areina meant to wrestle it to the ground. Not that she put it that way, but Nynaeve knew
it was what the woman meant.
Nynaeve knew very well why they touched her most, too. Each story could have been the
reflection of a thread in her own life. What she did not quite understand was why she liked Areina
best. It was her opinion, putting this and that together, that nearly all of Areina’s troubles came from
having too free a tongue, telling people exactly what she thought. It could hardly be coincidence that
she was harried out of one village so quickly she had to leave her horse behind after calling the
mayor a pie-faced loon and telling some village women that dry-bones kitchen sweepers had no right
to question why she was on the road alone. That was what she admitted to saying. Nynaeve thought a
few days of herself for example would do Areina worlds of good. And there had to be something she
could do for the other two, as well. She could understand a desire for safety and peace very well.
There was an odd exchange the morning of the second day, while tempers were still tender and
tongues—some people’s tongues!—still rough. Nynaeve said something, quite mildly, about Elayne
not being in her mother’s palace, so she need not think Nynaeve was going to sleep shoved against the
wall every night. Elayne tilted up her chin, but before she could open her mouth, Birgitte blurted,
“You are the Daughter-Heir of Andor?” She hardly looked around to make sure no one was close
enough to hear.
“I am.” Elayne sounded more dignified than Nynaeve remembered in some time, but there was a
hint of—could it be satisfaction?
Face completely blank, Birgitte simply turned away, walking up into the bow where she sat on a
coil of rope, staring at the river ahead. Elayne frowned after her, then finally went to sit beside her.
They sat talking softly for some time. Nynaeve would not have joined them even had she been asked!
Whatever they discussed, Elayne seemed slightly disgruntled, as if she had expected some other
result, but after that there was hardly a cross word between them.
Birgitte resumed her own name later that same day, though it was a last flare of temper that did
it. With Moghedien safely behind them, she and Elayne washed the black out of their hair with
pokeleaf, and Neres seeing one with red-gold curls about her shoulders and the other yellow-gold in
an intricate braid, and that one with bow and quiver, muttered acridly about “Birgitte stepping out of
the bloody stories.” It was his misfortune that she overheard. That was her name, she told him
sharply, and if he did not like it, she would pin his ears to either mast he chose. Blindfolded. He
stalked off red-faced and shouting for lines to be tightened that could not have been made any tighter
without popping.

At that point Nynaeve would not have cared whether Birgitte actually carried out the threat.
Pokeleaf might have left a slight reddish cast to her own hair, yet it was close enough to its natural
color almost to make her cry for joy. Unless everyone aboard came down with sore gums and
toothaches, she had more than enough pokeleaf remaining. And sufficient red fennel to keep her
stomach in its place. She could not help sighing in satisfaction once her hair was dry and in a proper
braid again.
Of course, with Elayne channeling good winds and Neres running light or dark, thatch-roofed
villages and farms sped past on either bank, marked by people waving in the day and lit windows in
the night, showing no sign of the turmoil farther upriver. Broad as the misnamed craft was, it made
good time, rolling along downriver.
Neres seemed torn between pleasure at his good luck at such winds and worry at moving in
daylight. More than once he gazed longingly at a backwater, a tree-shrouded stream or a pool cut
deep into the bank where Riverserpent might have been moored and hidden. Occasionally Nynaeve
remarked where he could hear about how glad he must be that the people from Samara would soon be
off his ship, with a comment thrown in about how well this woman was looking now that she was
rested or how energetic that woman’s children were. That was enough to put ideas of stopping right
out of his head. It might have been easier to threaten him with the Shienarans, or Thom and Juilin, but
those fellows were getting entirely too bigheaded as it was. And she certainly had no intention of
arguing with a man who still would neither look at her nor talk to her.
Gray dawning of the third day saw the crew manning the sweeps again to draw them in to a dock
at Boannda. It was a considerable town, larger than Samara, on a point of land where the swift River
Boern, coming down from Jehannah, ran into the slower Eldar. There were even three towers inside
the tall gray walls, and a building shining white beneath a red tile roof that could certainly pass for a
palace, if a small one. As Riverserpent was lashed fast to the heavy pilings at the end of one dock—
half their length across dried mud—Nynaeve wondered aloud why Neres had gone all the way to
Samara when he could have unloaded his goods here.
Elayne nodded toward a stout man on the dock who wore a chain with some sort of seal hanging
across his chest. There were several others like him, all with the chain and a blue coat, intently
watching two other broad vessels unload at other docks. “Queen Alliandre’s excisemen, I should
say.” Drumming his fingers on the rail, Neres was not looking at the men just as intently as they were
at the other vessels. “Perhaps he had an arrangement with those in Samara. I don’t think he wants to
talk to these.”
The men and women from Samara marched reluctantly up the gangplank, ignored by the
excisemen. There was no custom duty on people. For the Samarans, it was the beginning of
uncertainty. They had their lives ahead of them, and to begin anew, what they stood up in and what
Nynaeve and Elayne had given them. Before they were halfway down the dock, still huddling
together, some of the women were beginning to look as disheartened as the men. Some even began to
cry. Vexation painted Elayne’s face. She always wanted to take care of everyone. Nynaeve hoped
Elayne did not discover that she had slipped a few more silvers to some of the women.
Not all left the ship. Areina remained, and Nicola, and Marigan, tightly clutching her sons, who
gazed in anxious silence after the other children vanishing toward the town. The two lads had not said
a word since Samara that Nynaeve had heard.
“I want to go with you,” Nicola told Nynaeve, unconsciously wringing her hands. “I feel safe
near you.” Marigan nodded emphatically. Areina said nothing, but she stepped closer to the other two
women, making herself part of the group even as she looked levelly at Nynaeve, defying her to send

her away.
Thom shook his head slightly, and Juilin grimaced, but it was to Elayne and Birgitte that
Nynaeve looked. Elayne did not hesitate in nodding, and the other woman was only a second behind.
Gathering her skirts, Nynaeve marched to Neres, standing in the stern.
“I suppose I will have my ship back now,” he told the air somewhere between the ship and the
dock. “Not beforetime. This voyage has been the worst I ever undertook.”
Nynaeve smiled broadly. For once, he did look at her before she was done. Well, he almost did.
It was not as if Neres had much choice. He could hardly appeal to the authorities in Boannda.
And if he did not like the fares she offered, well, he had to sail downriver anyway. So Riverserpent
cast off again, heading for Ebou Dar, with one stop to be made that he was not informed of until
Boannda began falling astern.
“Salidar!” he growled, staring over Nynaeve’s head. “Salidar’s been abandoned since the
Whitecloak War. It would take a fool woman to want to be ashore at Salidar.”
Even smiling, Nynaeve was angry enough to embrace the Source. Neres roared, slapping at his
neck and his hip at the same time. “The horseflies are very bad this time of year,” she said
sympathetically. Birgitte roared with laughter before they were halfway down the deck.
Standing in the bows, Nynaeve inhaled deeply as Elayne channeled to bring the wind up again
and Riverserpent lumbered into the strong current flowing out of the Boern. She was all but eating red
fennel for meals, but even if she ran out before Salidar, she would not care. Their journey was almost
over. Everything she had been through was worth it, for that. Of course, she had not always thought
so, and Elayne and Birgitte’s rasping tongues had not been the only cause.
That first night, lying on the captain’s bed in her shift while a yawning Elayne occupied the chair
and Birgitte leaned against the door with her head brushing the beams, Nynaeve had used the twisted
stone ring. A single rusty gimbal-mounted lamp gave light, and surprisingly, a scent of spice from the
oil; maybe Neres had not liked the stench of must and mold, either. If she was ostentatious about
nestling the ring between her breasts—and making sure the others knew it touched skin—well, she
had cause. A few hours of superficially reasonable behavior on their parts had not made her less
wary.
The Heart of the Stone was exactly as it had been every time before, pale light coming from
everywhere and nowhere, the glittering crystal sword Callandor thrust into the floorstones beneath
the great dome, rows of huge polished redstone columns running off into shadow. And that sensation
of being watched that was so common in Tel’aran’rhiod. It was all Nynaeve could do not to flee, or
set off on a frantic search through the columns. She forced herself to stand in one place beside
Callandor, counting slowly to one thousand and pausing every hundred to call Egwene’s name.
Truly, it was all she could do. The control she was so proud of vanished. Her clothes flickered
with her worries about herself and Moghedien, Egwene and Rand and Lan. Between one minute and
the next stout Two Rivers woolens became a muffling cloak and deep hood which became a suit of
Whitecloak mail which became the red silk dress—only transparent!— which became an ever thicker
cloak which became . . . She thought her face changed, too. Once she saw her hands, with skin darker
than Juilin’s. Perhaps if Moghedien could not recognize her . . .
“Egwene!” The last hoarse call echoed among the columns, and Nynaeve made herself stand
there shivering for one more count of one hundred. The great chamber remained empty except for her.
Wishing she could feel more regret than haste, she stepped out of the dream . . .
. . . and lay fingering the stone ring on its thong, staring at the thick beams above the bed and
listening to the thousand creaks of the ship rushing downriver through the darkness.

“Was she there?” Elayne demanded. “You were not gone very long, but—”
“I am tired of being afraid,” Nynaeve said without taking her gaze from the beams. “I am s-so
tired of being a c-coward.” The last words dissolved into tears she could neither stop nor hide, no
matter how she scrubbed at her eyes.
Elayne was there in an instant, holding her and smoothing her hair, and an instant later, Birgitte
pressed a cloth dampened in cool water against the back of her neck. She cried herself out to the
sound of them telling her she was not a coward.
“If I thought Moghedien was hunting me,” Birgitte said finally, “I would run. If there was no
other place to hide than a badger’s hole, I would wriggle in and curl into a ball and sweat until she
was gone. I would not stand in front of one of Cerandin’s s’redit if it charged, either; and neither is
cowardice. You must choose your own time and your own ground, and come at her in the way she
least expects. I will take my revenge on her if ever I can, but that is the only way I will. Anything else
would be foolish.”
That was hardly what Nynaeve wanted to hear, but her tears and their comfort made another gap
in the thorny hedges that had grown up between them.
“I will prove to you that you are no coward.” Taking the dark wooden box from the shelf where
she had put it, Elayne removed the spiral-scribed iron disc. “We will go back together.”
That, Nynaeve wanted to hear even less. But there was no way to avoid it, not after they had told
her she was not a coward. So back they went.
To the Stone of Tear, where they stared at Callandor— better than looking over your shoulder
and wondering whether Moghedien was going to appear—then to the Royal Palace in Caemlyn with
Elayne leading, and Emond’s Field under Nynaeve’s guidance. Nynaeve had seen palaces before,
with their huge halls and great painted ceilings and marble floors, their gilding and fine carpets and
elaborate hangings, but this was where Elayne had grown up. Seeing it, and knowing that, made her
understand a little of Elayne. Of course the woman expected the world to bend itself to her; she had
grown up being taught that it would, in a place where it did.
Elayne, a pale image of herself because of the ter’angreal she was using, was strangely quiet
while they were there. But then, Nynaeve was quiet in Emond’s Field. For one thing, the village was
larger than she remembered, with more thatch-roofed houses and others’ wooden frameworks going
up. Someone was building a very big house just outside the village, three sprawling stories, and a
stone plinth five paces high had been erected on the Green, carved all over with names. A good many
she recognized; they were mostly Two Rivers names. A flagpole stood to either side of the plinth, one
topped by a banner with a red wolf’s head, the other one with a red eagle. Everything looked
prosperous and happy—as much as she could say, with no people there—but it made no sense. What
on earth were those banners? And who would be building such a house?
They flashed to the White Tower, to Elaida’s study. Nothing had changed there, except that only
half a dozen stools remained in the semicircle in front of Elaida’s table. And the triptych of Bonwhin
was gone. The painting of Rand remained, with a poorly mended tear in the canvas across Rand’s
face, as if someone had thrown something at it.
They rifled the papers in the lacquered box with its golden hawks, and those on the Keeper’s
table in the anteroom. Documents and letters changed while they looked at them, yet they did learn a
little. Elaida knew that Rand had crossed the Dragonwall into Cairhien, but of what she intended to
do about it, there was no clue. An angry demand that all Aes Sedai return to the Tower immediately
unless they had specific orders otherwise from her. Elaida seemed to be angry about a good deal, that
so few sisters had returned after her offer of amnesty, that most of the eyes-and-ears in Tarabon were

still silent, that Pedron Niall was still calling Whitecloaks back to Amadicia when she did not know
why, that Davram Bashere still could not be found despite having an army with him. Fury filled every
document over her seal. None of it seemed of real use or interest, except maybe about the
Whitecloaks. Not that they should have any difficulty there as long as they were on Riverserpent.
When they returned to their bodies on the ship, Elayne was silent as she rose from the chair and
replaced the disc in the box. Without thinking, Nynaeve got up to help her out of her dress. Birgitte
scrambled up the ladder as they climbed into the bed together in their shifts; she intended to sleep
right at the top of the ladder, she said.
Elayne channeled to extinguish the lamp. After a time lying in the dark, she said, “The palace
seemed so . . . empty, Nynaeve. It felt so empty.”
Nynaeve did not know what else a place was supposed to be in Tel’aran’rhiod. “It was the
ter’angreal you used. You looked almost foggy to me.”
“Well, I looked just fine to me.” There was only a touch of asperity in Elayne’s voice, though,
and they settled down to sleep.
Nynaeve had remembered the other woman’s elbows accurately, but they could not diminish her
good mood, and neither could Elayne’s complaining murmur that she had cold feet. She had done it.
Perhaps forgetting to be afraid was not the same as not being afraid, but at least she had gone back to
the World of Dreams. Perhaps one day she could find the nerve again not to be afraid.
Having begun, it was easier to go on than to stop. Every night after that they entered
Tel’aran’rhiod together, always with a visit to the Tower to see what they could learn. There was not
very much, besides an order sending an emissary to Salidar to invite the Aes Sedai there to return to
the Tower. Except, the invitation—as much as Nynaeve could read before it changed to a report on
screening potential novices for proper attitudes, whatever that was supposed to mean—was more a
demand that those Aes Sedai submit to Elaida immediately and be thankful they were allowed to.
Still, it was confirmation that they were not chasing a wild hare. The trouble with the rest of what
they saw in fragments was they did not know enough to fit them together. Who was this Davram
Bashere, and why was Elaida so frantic to find him? Why had Elaida forbidden anyone to mention the
name of Mazrim Taim, the false Dragon, with a threat of stiff penalties? Why had Queen Tenobia of
Saldaea and King Easar of Shienar both written letters politely but stiffly resenting White Tower
meddling in their affairs? It all made Elayne murmur one of Lini’s sayings: “ ‘To know two, you must
first know one.’ ” Nynaeve could only agree that it certainly seemed so.
Aside from the trips to Elaida’s study, they worked at learning control, of themselves and their
surroundings in the World of Dreams. Nynaeve did not mean to let herself be caught again as she had
been by Egwene, and by the Wise Ones. Moghedien she tried not to think about. Much better to
concentrate on the Wise Ones.
Of Egwene’s trick of appearing in their dreams, as she had in Samara, they could puzzle out
nothing; calling her did nothing except increase that uneasy feeling of being watched, and she did not
make another such appearance. Trying to hold somebody else in Tel’aran’rhiod was incredibly
frustrating, even after Elayne hit on the trick, which was to see the other as just another part of the
dream. Elayne did it finally—and Nynaeve congratulated her with as good grace as she could muster
—but for days Nynaeve could not. Elayne might as well have been the near mist she seemed,
vanishing with a smile whenever she chose. When Nynaeve finally managed to fasten Elayne there,
she felt the strain as if she were picking up a boulder.
Creating fantastical flowers or shapes by thinking of them was much more fun. The effort
involved seemed related to both how large the thing was and whether it might really exist. Trees

covered with wildly shaped blossoms in red and gold and purple were harder to make than a standmirror to examine what you had done to your dress, or what the other woman had done to it. A
gleaming crystal palace rising out of the ground was harder still, and even if it felt solid to the touch,
it changed whenever the image in your mind wavered and vanished as soon as the image did. They
quietly decided to leave animals alone after a peculiar thing—much like a horse with a horn on its
nose!— chased them both up a hill before they could make it vanish. That very nearly sparked a new
argument, with each of them claiming the other had made it, but by that time Elayne had recovered
enough of her old self to start giggling over how they must have looked, racing up the hill with their
skirts hauled up, shouting at the thing to go away. Even Elayne’s stubborn refusal to admit it had been
her fault could not stop Nynaeve’s giggles from bubbling up, too.
Elayne alternated between the iron disc and the apparently amber plaque with its carving of a
sleeping woman, but she did not really like using either ter’angreal. As hard as she worked with
them, she did not feel as fully in Tel’aran’rhiod as with the ring. And each did have to be worked; it
was not possible to tie the flow of Spirit, or you bounced right back out of the World of Dreams
immediately. Channeling anything else at the same time seemed all but impossible, yet Elayne could
not understand why. She seemed more interested in how they had been made, and not at all pleased
that they did not yield their secrets as easily as the a’dam. Not knowing the “why” was a burr in her
stocking.
Once, Nynaeve tried one of the pair, coincidentally on the night they were to meet Egwene, the
night after leaving Boannda. She would not have been angry enough if not for the thing that rubbed her
wrong so often. Men.
Neres began it, stumping around the deck as the sun began to sink, muttering to himself about
having his cargo stolen. She ignored him, of course. Then Thom, making up his bed at the foot of the
after mast, said quietly, “He has a point.”
It was plain he did not see her in the fading lurid light, and neither did Juilin, squatting beside
him. “He’s a smuggler, but he did pay for those goods. Nynaeve had no right to seize them.”
“A woman’s flaming rights are whatever she flaming says they are.” Uno laughed. “That’s what
women in Shienar say, anyway.”
That was when they saw her and fell silent, as usual finding wisdom too late. Uno rubbed at his
cheek, the one without a scar. He had removed his bandages that day, and he knew now what had
been done. She thought he looked embarrassed. It was hard to tell in the fast-shifting shadows, but the
other two seemed to have no expression at all.
She did nothing to them, of course, only stalked away with a firm grip on her braid. She even
managed to stalk down the ladder. Elayne already had the iron disc in her hand; the dark wooden box
sat open on the table. Nynaeve picked up the yellowish plaque carved inside with a sleeping woman;
it felt slick and soft, not at all something that would scratch metal. With that edge of anger smoldering
inside her, saidar was a warm glow just out of sight over her shoulder. “Maybe I can come up with
some idea why this thing won’t let you channel anything but dribbles.”
Which was how she found herself in the Heart of the Stone, channeling a flow of Spirit into the
plaque, which in Tel’aran’rhiod was tucked into her belt pouch. As she often did in the World of
Dreams, Elayne wore a gown suitable for her mother’s court, green silk embroidered in gold around
the neck, with a necklace and bracelets of gold links and moonstones, but Nynaeve was surprised to
discover that she herself had on something not very different, though her hair was in a braid—and its
own color—instead of loose about her shoulders. Her gown was pale blue and silver, and if not so
low as Luca’s dresses, still lower than she thought she would have chosen. Still, she liked the way the

single firedrop on its silver chain looked gleaming between her breasts. Egwene would not find it
easy to bully a woman dressed so. Certainly not that that could have had anything to do with why she
had donned it, even unconsciously.
Right away she saw what Elayne had meant about looking just fine; to herself, she appeared no
different than the other woman, who had the twisted stone ring somehow threaded onto her necklace.
Elayne, however, said she looked . . . misty. Misty was how saidar felt, too, except for the flow of
Spirit she had begun to weave while awake. The rest was thin, and even the never-seen warmth of the
True Source seemed muted. Her anger remained just strong enough for her to channel. If irritation at
the men faded before the puzzle, that puzzle was its own irritant; steeling herself to confront Egwene
had no part in it; she was not steeling herself at all, and there was no reason for the faint taste of
boiled catfern and powdered mavinsleaf on her tongue! Yet producing a single flame, dancing in
midair, one of the first things a novice was taught, seemed as difficult as throwing Lan over her
shoulder. The flame looked attenuated even to her, and as soon as she tied the weave, it began to fade
away. In seconds it was gone.
“Both of you?” Amys said. She and Egwene were just there, on the other side of Callandor, both
in Aiel skirts and blouses and shawls. At least Egwene had not donned so many necklaces and
bracelets. “Why do you appear so strange, Nynaeve? Have you learned to come waking?”
Nynaeve gave a little jump. She did so hate people sneaking up on her. “Egwene, how did you
—” she began, smoothing her skirts, at the same time that Elayne said, “Egwene, we can’t understand
how you—”
Egwene broke in. “Rand and the Aiel have won a great victory at Cairhien.” Out it all came in a
torrent, everything she had told them in their dreams, from Sammael to the Seanchan spearhead. Each
word almost tripped over the next, and she drove every one home with an intent stare.
Nynaeve exchanged confused glances with Elayne. Surely she had told them. They could not
have imagined it, not with every word confirmed now. Even Amys, long white hair only emphasizing
the not quite Aes Sedai agelessness of her face, looked amazed at the flood.
“Mat killed Couladin?” Nynaeve exclaimed at one point. That had certainly not been in their
dreams of her. It did not sound like Mat at all. Leading soldiers? Mat?
When Egwene finally trailed off, shifting her shawl and breathing a little quickly—she had
barely paused for breath along the way—Elayne said weakly, “Is he well?” She sounded as if she
was almost beginning to doubt her own memories.
“As well as can be expected,” Amys said. “He drives himself hard, and listens to no one. Except
Moiraine.” Amys was not pleased.
“Aviendha is with him almost all the time,” Egwene said. “She is taking good care of him for
you.”
Nynaeve doubted that. She did not know much about Aiel, but she suspected that if Amys said
“hard,” anyone else would say “murderously.”
Apparently, Elayne agreed. “Then why is she letting him push himself? What is he doing?”
Quite a bit, it turned out, and clearly too much. Two hours each day practicing the sword with
Lan or anyone else he could find. That made Amys’ mouth tighten sourly. Two more studying the Aiel
way of fighting without weapons. Egwene might find that strange, but Nynaeve was all too aware of
how helpless you could be when you could not channel. Still, Rand certainly should never find
himself in that position. He had become a king, or something more, surrounded by Far Dareis Mai
guards, ordering lords and ladies about. In fact, he spent so much time ordering them, and chasing
after them to make sure they did what he said, that he would not spare time for meals if the Maidens

did not bring him food wherever he was. For some reason, while that seemed to irk Egwene almost as
much as it did Elayne, Amys looked distinctly amused, though her face went back to Aiel stoniness
once she saw Nynaeve notice. Yet another hour each day was given to a strange school he had
founded, inviting not only scholars but craftsmen, from some fellow who made looking glasses to a
woman who had constructed some sort of huge crossbow with pulleys that could hurl a spear a mile.
He had told no one his purpose there, except maybe Moiraine, but the only answer the Aes Sedai had
given Egwene was that the urge to leave something behind was strong in everyone. Moiraine did not
seem to care what Rand did.
“What remains of the Shaido are retreating north,” Amys said grimly, “and more slip across the
Dragonwall to them every day, but Rand al’Thor seems to have forgotten them. He is sending the
spears south, toward Tear. Half are gone already. Rhuarc says he has not even told the chiefs why,
and I do not think Rhuarc would lie to me. Moiraine stands closer to Rand al’Thor than any except
Aviendha, yet she refuses to ask him.” Shaking her head, she muttered, “Though in her defense, I will
say that even Aviendha has learned nothing.”
“The best way to keep a secret is to tell no one,” Elayne told her, which earned her a hard stare.
Amys was not far behind Bair when it came to stares that made you shift your feet.
“We aren’t going to reason it out here,” Nynaeve said, fixing her gaze on Egwene. The other
woman seemed uneasy. If there was any time to begin redressing the balance between them, it might
as well be now. “What I want to know—”
“You are quite right,” Egwene cut in. “We are not in Sheriam’s study, where we can lounge
about and chatter. What have you to tell us? Are you still with Master Luca’s menagerie?”
Nynaeve’s breath caught, questions flying right out of her head. There was so much to tell. And
so much not to. She claimed she had followed Lanfear to the meeting between the Forsaken, and
spoke only of seeing Moghedien spying. Not that she wanted to avoid telling how she had been
handled by Moghedien—not really; not exactly—but Birgitte had not released them from their
promise of secrecy. Of course, that meant not telling about Birgitte at all, that she was with them. It
was awkward, knowing that Egwene knew Brigitte was helping them, and still having to keep
pretending that Egwene knew nothing at all, but Nynaeve managed despite stammering when Egwene
arched her eyebrows. The Light be thanked, Elayne helped her present Samara as Galad and
Masema’s fault. Which it was, in truth. If either had simply sent to tell her about the ship, none of the
rest would have followed.
When she finished—with Salidar—Amys said quietly, “You are certain they will support the
Car’a’carn?”
“They must know the Prophecies of the Dragon as well as Elaida,” Elayne said. “The best way
to oppose her is to attach themselves to Rand, and make it clear to the world that they intend to
support him all the way to Tarmon Gai’don.” Not the slightest quaver in her voice betrayed that she
was not speaking of an absolute stranger. “Otherwise, they are just rebels, with no claim to
legitimacy. They need him at least as much as he needs them.”
Amys nodded, but not as if she was ready to agree yet.
“I think I remember Masema,” Egwene said. “Hollow eyes and a sour mouth?” Nynaeve nodded.
“I can hardly imagine him as any sort of prophet, but I can see him starting a riot or a war. I’m sure
Galad only did what he thought was best.” Egwene’s cheeks colored slightly; even the memory of
Galad’s face could do that. “Rand will want to know about Masema. And Salidar. If I can make him
stand still long enough to listen.”
“I want to know how it happens that you are both here,” Amys said. She listened to their

explanation, and turned the plaque over in her hand once Nynaeve fished it out. Having the
ter’angreal touched by someone else while she was using it made Nynaeve’s skin crawl. “I believe
you are less here than Elayne,” the Wise One said finally. “When a Dreamwalker enters the World of
Dreams in her sleep, only a tiny bit of her remains with her body, just enough to keep her body alive.
If she puts herself into a shallow sleep, where she can be here and also speak to those around her in
the waking world, she looks as you do to one who is here fully. Perhaps it is the same. I do not know
that I like it, any woman who can channel being able to enter Tel’aran’rhiod, even in this state.” She
returned the ter’angreal to Nynaeve.
Heaving a sigh of relief, Nynaeve hastily tucked the plaque away again. Her stomach was still
fluttering.
“If you have told everything . . .” Amys paused while Nynaeve and Elayne hurriedly said that
they had. The woman’s blue eyes were incredibly penetrating. “Then we must go. I will admit there is
more to be gained from these meetings than I first supposed, but I have much to do yet tonight.” She
glanced at Egwene, and they vanished as one.
Nynaeve and Elayne did not hesitate. Around them the great redstone columns changed in a blink
to a small, dark-paneled room, its furnishings few, plain and sturdy. Nynaeve’s anger had been
wavering, and with it her hold on saidar, but the Mistress of Novices’ study firmed both. Stubbornly
defiant indeed! She hoped that Sheriam was in Salidar; it would be a pleasure to face her on an equal
footing. Still, she could have wished to be somewhere else. Elayne was peering into the mirror with
its flaking gilt frame, nonchalantly adjusting her hair with her hands. Only she had no need to use her
hands here. She did not like being in this room either. Why had Egwene suggested meeting here?
Elaida’s study might not be the most comfortable place to be, but it was better than this.
A moment later, Egwene was there, on the other side of the broad table, eyes icy and hands on
her hips as if she was the room’s rightful occupant.
Before Nynaeve could open her mouth, Egwene said, “Have you two brainless flaptongues
become witless ninnies? If I ask you to keep something to yourselves, do you immediately tell the first
person you meet? Did it never occur to you that you don’t have to tell everyone everything? I thought
you two were good at keeping secrets.” Nynaeve’s cheeks grew warmer; at least she could not
possibly be as scarlet as Elayne. Egwene was not quite finished. “As for how I did it, I can’t teach
you. You have to be a Dreamwalker. If you can touch somebody’s dreams with the ring, I don’t know
how. And I doubt you can with that other thing. Try to keep your mind on what you’re doing. Salidar
may be nothing like you expect. Now, I also have things to do tonight. At least try to keep your wits
about you!” And she was gone so suddenly the last word almost seemed to come from empty air.
Embarrassment ate at Nynaeve’s anger. She had nearly burst out with it after Egwene asked her
not to. And Birgitte: How could you keep a secret when the other woman knew? Embarrassment won,
and saidar slipped away like sand through her fingers.
Nynaeve wakened with a jerk, the deep yellow ter’angreal firmly clutched in one hand. The
gimbal-mounted lamp was turned down to a dim light. Elayne lay crowded in next to her, still asleep;
the ring on its thong had slid down into the hollow of her throat.
Muttering to herself, Nynaeve clambered over the other woman to put away the plaque, then
poured a little water into the washbasin to bathe her face and neck. The water was lukewarm, but it
felt cool. In the shadowy light, she thought the mirror said she was still blushing. So much for
redressing the balance. If only they had met anywhere else. If only she had not flapped her tongue like
a brainless girl. It would have gone better if she had been using the ring, instead of being a wraith as
far as the other woman was concerned. It was all Thom and Juilin’s fault. And Uno’s. If they had not

made her angry . . . No, it was Neres’ fault. He . . . She took the pitcher in both hands and washed her
mouth. It was only the taste of sleep she was trying to get rid of. Nothing like boiled catfern and
powdered mavinsleaf. Nothing at all.
When she turned from the washstand, Elayne was just sitting up, untying the leather cord that
held the ring. “I saw you losing saidar, so I went by Elaida’s study, but I didn’t think I should stay
long in case you worried. I didn’t learn anything, except that Shemerin is to be arrested and reduced
to Accepted.” She got up and tucked the ring into the box.
“They can do that? Demote an Aes Sedai?”
“I don’t know. I think Elaida is doing anything she wants. Egwene shouldn’t wear those Aiel
clothes. They are not very becoming.”
Nynaeve let out the breath she had been holding. Obviously Elayne wanted to ignore what
Egwene had said. Nynaeve was willing to let her. “No, they certainly aren’t.” Climbing onto the bed,
she scrunched over against the wall; they took turns sleeping on the outside.
“I did not even have a chance to send a message to Rand.” Elayne got in after, and the lamp
winked out. The small windows let in only dribbles of moonlight. “And one to Aviendha. If she is
taking care of him for me, then she ought to take care of him.”
“He isn’t a horse, Elayne. You don’t own him.”
“I never said I did. How will you feel if Lan takes up with some Cairhienin woman?”
“Don’t be silly. Go to sleep.” Nynaeve burrowed fiercely into her small pillow. Perhaps she
should have sent word to Lan. All those noblewomen, Tairen as well as Cairhienin. Feeding a man
honey instead of telling him the truth. He had better not forget who he belonged to.
Below Boannda, woods closed in tightly on both sides of the river, unbroken tangles of trees and
vines. Villages and farms vanished. The Eldar might as well have run through wilderness a thousand
miles from human habitation. Five days out of Samara, early afternoon found Riverserpent anchored
in the middle of a bend in the river, while the ship’s one boat ferried the remaining passengers to a
beach of cracked dry mud bordered by low, forested hills. Even the tall willows and deep-rooted
oaks showed some brown leaves.
“There was no need to give the man that necklace,” Nynaeve said on the shore, watching the
rowboat approach, crowded with four oarsmen, Juilin and the last five Shienarans. She hoped she had
not been gullible; Neres had showed her his map of this stretch of the river, pointing out the mark for
Salidar two miles from the water, but nothing else indicated there had ever been a village anywhere
near here. The forest wall was quite unbroken. “What I paid him was quite enough.”
“Not to cover his cargo,” Elayne replied. “Just because he’s a smuggler doesn’t mean we have a
right to take it from him.” Nynaeve wondered whether she had been talking to Juilin. Probably not. It
was just the law again. “Besides, yellow opals are gaudy, especially in that setting. Anyway, it was
worth it, just to see his face.” Elayne giggled abruptly. “He looked at me this time.” Nynaeve tried
not to, but she could not help giggling, too.
Thom was up near the trees, trying to amuse Marigan’s two boys by juggling colored balls
produced from his sleeves. Jaril and Seve stared at him silently, hardly blinking, and held on to each
other. Nynaeve had not really been surprised when Marigan and Nicola asked to accompany her.
Nicola might be watching Thom and laughing delightedly now, but she would have spent every
moment at Nynaeve’s side had the latter allowed it. Areina wanting to come had been something of a
shock, though. She was sitting off by herself on a fallen log, watching Birgitte, who was stringing her
bow. All three women might be in for a shock when they discovered what was in Salidar. At least
Nicola would find her sanctuary, and Marigan might even have a chance to dispense herbs if there

were not too many Yellows about.
“Nynaeve, have you thought about . . . how we’re going to be received?”
Nynaeve looked at Elayne in astonishment. They had crossed half the world, or near enough, and
defeated the Black Ajah twice. Well, they had had help in Tear, but Tanchico had been all their
doing. They brought news of Elaida and the Tower she was willing to bet no one in Salidar had. And
most importantly, they could help these sisters make contact with Rand. “Elayne, I won’t say they will
greet us as heroes, but it wouldn’t surprise me if they kissed us before today is done.” Rand alone
would be worth that.
Two of the barefoot sailors leaped out to hold the rowboat against the current, and Juilin and the
Shienarans splashed ashore as the sailors scrambled back aboard. On Riverserpent men were already
hauling in the anchor.
“Clear us a path, Uno,” Nynaeve said. “I mean to be there before dark.” From the look of the
forest, all vines and dusty undergrowth, two miles might take that long. If Neres had not managed to
gull her. That worried her more than anything else.

CHAPTER
50

To Teach, and Learn

Some four hours later, the sweat running down Nynaeve’s face had very little to do with
unseasonable heat, and she was wondering whether it might not have been better if Neres had gulled
them. Or refused to carry them beyond Boannda. Late-afternoon sunlight slanted sharply through
windows with mostly cracked panes. Clutching her skirts in blended irritation and unease, she tried to
avoid looking at the six Aes Sedai grouped around one of the sturdy tables near the wall. Their
mouths moved silently as they conferred behind a screen of saidar. Elayne had her chin high, her
hands folded calmly at her waist, but a tightness about her eyes and the corners of her mouth spoiled
her regal air. Nynaeve was not sure she wanted to know what the Aes Sedai were saying; one
stunning blow after another had knocked all her high expectations into a daze. One more shock and
she thought she might scream, and she did not know whether from fury or pure hysteria.
Very nearly everything except their clothes was laid out on that table, from Birgitte’s silver
arrow in front of stout Morvrin to the three ter’angreal before Sheriam, to the gilded coffers in front
of dark-eyed Myrelle. Not one of the women looked pleased. Carlinya’s face might have been carved
from snow, even motherly Anaiya wore a stern mask, and Beonin’s look of constant wide-eyed
startlement had a distinctly annoyed cast. Annoyed and something more. Sometimes Beonin made as if
to touch the white cloth spread neatly over the cuendillar seal, but her hand always stopped and
retreated.
Nynaeve’s eyes jerked away from the cloth. She knew exactly when things had begun to go
wrong. The Warders who surrounded them in the woods had been proper, if cool—once she made
Uno and the Shienarans put up their swords, anyway. And Min’s warm greetings had been all laughter
and hugs. But the Aes Sedai and others in the streets, caught up in their own errands, had scurried
along with hardly a glance for the party being escorted in. Salidar was quite crowded, with armed
men drilling in nearly every open space. The first person aside from the Warders and Min to pay any
attention to them at all had been the lean Brown sister they were taken to, in what had once been the
common room of this inn. She and Elayne had told the story they had agreed on to Phaedrine Sedai, or
tried to. Five minutes into it, they were left standing, with strict orders not to move a foot or speak a
word, even to each other. Ten more minutes, staring at one another in confusion, while all around
them Accepted and white-clad novices, Warders and servants and soldiers bustled between tables
where Aes Sedai pored over papers and briskly handed out orders, and then they had been hustled
before Sheriam and the others so quickly Nynaeve did not think her shoes had touched the floor twice.
That was when the grilling had begun, more suitable for captured prisoners than returning heroes.
Nynaeve dabbed at the perspiration on her face, but as soon as she tucked the handkerchief back up
her sleeve, her hands returned to their grip on her skirts.

She and Elayne were not alone standing on the colorful silk carpet. Siuan, in a plain dress of fine
blue wool, might have been there by choice if Nynaeve had not known better, her face cool, utterly
composed. She seemed lost in untroubled thought. Leane at least watched the Aes Sedai, yet she
appeared equally confident. In fact, somehow more self-confident than Nynaeve remembered. The
copper-skinned woman looked even more willowy, too, more supple in some fashion. Perhaps it was
her scandalous dress. That pale green silk was every bit as high-necked as Siuan’s, but it clung to
every curve of her, and the material only managed to be opaque by a thin hair. It was their faces that
truly stunned Nynaeve, though. She had never expected to find either alive, and certainly never
looking so very young—no more than a few years older than she if that. They did not so much as
glance at one another. In truth, she thought she detected a distinct chill between them.
There was another difference about them, one that Nynaeve was just beginning to recognize. If
everyone including Min had been ginger about it, no one made any real secret of the fact that they had
been stilled. Nynaeve could feel that lack. Perhaps it was being in a room where all the other women
could channel, or perhaps it was knowing they had been stilled, but for the first time she was truly
conscious of the ability in Elayne and the others. And its absence from Siuan and Leane. Something
had been taken from them, cut away. It was like a wound. Perhaps the worst wound a woman could
suffer.
Curiosity overcame her. What sort of wound would it be? What had been cut away? She might as
well make use of the waiting, and the irritation that larded itself through her nervousness. She reached
out to saidar. . . .
“Did anyone grant you permission to channel here, Accepted?” Sheriam asked, and Nynaeve
gave a start, hurriedly releasing the True Source.
The green-eyed Aes Sedai led the others back to their mismatched chairs, arranged on the carpet
in a semicircle that had the four standing women as its focus. Some of them carried things from the
table. They sat staring at Nynaeve, earlier emotion swallowed in Aes Sedai calm. None of those
ageless faces acknowledged the heat by so much as a single bead of moisture. Finally Anaiya said in
a gently chiding voice, “You have been very long from us, child. Whatever you have learned in the
interval, you have apparently forgotten much.”
Blushing, Nynaeve curtsied. “Forgive me, Aes Sedai. I did not mean to overstep.” She hoped
they thought it was shame that heated her cheeks. She had been away from them a long time. Just one
day ago, she had given the orders and people jumped when she spoke. Now she was the one expected
to jump. It galled.
“You tell an interesting . . . story.” Carlinya obviously believed little of it. The White sister
turned Birgitte’s silver arrow over in long slender hands. “And you acquired some strange
possessions.”
“The Panarch Amathera gave us many gifts, Aes Sedai,” Elayne said. “She seemed to think we
saved her throne.” Even delivered in a perfectly level voice, that speech was a walk on thin ice.
Nynaeve was not the only one irritated by their fall from freedom. Carlinya’s smooth face tightened.
“You come with disturbing news,” Sheriam said. “And some disturbing . . . things.” Her slightly
tilted eyes wandered to the table, to the silvery a’dam, and returned firmly to Elayne and Nynaeve.
Since learning what it was, what it was for, most of the Aes Sedai had treated it like a live red adder.
Most had.
“If the thing does what these children claim,” Morvrin said absently, “we need to study it. And if
Elayne really believes she can make a ter’angreal. . . .” The Brown sister shook her head. Her real
attention was on the flattened stone ring, all flecked and striped in red and blue and brown, that she

held in one hand. The other two ter’angreal lay on her broad lap. “You say that this came from Verin
Sedai? How is it this was never mentioned to us before?” That was not directed at Nynaeve or
Elayne, but at Siuan.
Siuan frowned, but not the fierce frown Nynaeve remembered. It held a touch of diffidence, as if
she knew she was speaking to her superiors, and so did her voice. That was another change Nynaeve
could hardly believe. “Verin never told me of it. I would very much like to ask her a few questions.”
“And I have questions about this.” Myrelle’s olive face darkened as she unfolded a familiar
paper—why had they ever kept that?— and read aloud. “ ‘What the bearer does is done at my order
and by my authority. Obey, and keep silent, at my command. Siuan Sanche, Watcher of the Seals,
Flame of Tar Valon, The Amyrlin Seat.’ ” She crumpled the paper and its seal in her fist. “Hardly
something to be handed out to Accepted.”
“At the time, I did not know who I could trust,” Siuan said smoothly. The six Aes Sedai stared at
her. “It was within my authority then.” The six Aes Sedai did not blink. Her voice took on a thread of
exasperated pleading. “You cannot call me to account for doing what I had to do when I had a perfect
right to do it. When the boat’s sinking, you plug the hole with what you can find.”
“And why did you not tell us?” Sheriam asked quietly, but with a hint of steel. As Mistress of
Novices she had never raised her voice, though sometimes you wished she would. “Three Accepted
—Accepted!—sent out of the Tower chasing thirteen full sisters of the Black Ajah. Do you use babies
to plug the hole in your boat, Siuan?”
“We are hardly babies,” Nynaeve told her heatedly. “Several of those thirteen are dead, and we
thwarted their plans twice. In Tear, we—”
Carlinya cut her off like an icy knife. “You have told us all about Tear, child. And Tanchico.
And defeating Moghedien.” Her mouth twisted wryly. She had already said that Nynaeve had been a
fool to come within a mile of one of the Forsaken, that she was lucky to have escaped with her life.
That Carlinya did not know how right she was—they certainly had not told everything—only made
Nynaeve’s stomach clench tighter. “You are children, and lucky if we decide not to spank you. Now
hold your peace until you are called on to speak.” Nynaeve flushed heavily, hoping they took it for
embarrassment, and held her peace.
Sheriam had never taken her eyes from Siuan. “Well? Why have you never mentioned sending
three children out to hunt lions?”
Siuan drew a deep breath, but folded her hands and ducked her head penitently. “There seemed
no point, Aes Sedai, with so much else of importance. I have held nothing back, when there was the
faintest reason for telling. Every scrap I knew of the Black Ajah, I told. I’ve not known where these
two were or what they were up to for some time. The important thing is that they are here now, and
with those three ter’angreal. You must realize what it means to have access to Elaida’s study, to her
papers, if only in bits. You’d never have known that she knows where you are until it was too late,
except for that.”
“We realize that,” Anaiya said, eyeing Morvrin, who was still frowning at the ring. “It is just
that perhaps the means of it takes us a little by surprise.”
“Tel’aran’rhiod,” Myrelle breathed. “Why, it has become no more than a matter for scholarly
discussion in the Tower, almost a legend. And Aiel Dreamwalkers. Who would have imagined that
Aiel Wise Ones could channel, much less this?”
Nynaeve wished they had been able to keep that secret—like Birgitte’s true identity and a few
other things they had managed to hold back—but it was difficult to keep things from slipping out when
you were being questioned by women who could bore holes in stone with a look when they wanted.

Well, she supposed she should be glad they had managed to hang on to what they had. Once
Tel’aran’rhiod had been mentioned, and that they had entered it, a mouse would have treed cats
before these women stopped asking questions.
Leane took a half-step forward, not looking at Siuan. “The important thing is that with these
ter’angreal you can talk to Egwene, and through her to Moiraine. Between them, you can not only
keep an eye on Rand al’Thor, you should be able to influence him even in Cairhien.”
“Where he went from the Aiel Waste,” Siuan said, “where I predicted he would be.” If her eyes
and words were directed at the Aes Sedai, her astringent tone was plainly meant for Leane, who
grunted.
“Much good that did. Two Aes Sedai sent off to the Waste chasing ducks.”
Oh, yes, there was very definitely a chill there.
“Enough, children,” Anaiya said, very much as if they really were children and she a mother
used to their petty squabbles. She eyed the other Aes Sedai meaningfully. “It will be a very good thing
to be able to talk with Egwene.”
“If these work as claimed,” Morvrin said, bouncing the ring on one palm and fingering the other
ter’angreal on her lap. The woman would not believe the sky was blue without proof.
Sheriam nodded. “Yes. That will be your first duty, Elayne, Nynaeve. You will have a chance to
teach Aes Sedai, showing us how to use them.”
Nynaeve curtsied, baring her teeth; they could take it for a smile if they chose. Teach them? Yes,
and never get near the ring, or the others, again after. Elayne’s curtsy was even stiffer, her face a cool
mask. Her eyes rolled toward that fool a’dam almost longingly.
“The letters-of-rights will be useful,” Carlinya said. With all that White Ajah coolness and
logic, testiness still showed in the way she clipped her words. “Gareth Bryne always wants more
gold than we have, but with those, we may almost be able to satisfy him.”
“Yes,” Sheriam said. “And we must take most of the coin, too. There are more mouths to feed
and more backs to clothe every day, here and elsewhere.”
Elayne gave a gracious nod, just as if they would not take the money whatever she said, but
Nynaeve simply waited. Gold and letters-of-rights and even ter’angreal were only a part.
“For the rest,” Sheriam went on, “we are agreed that you left the Tower by command, however
erroneous it was, and you cannot be held to account for it. Now that you are safely back with us, you
will resume your studies.”
Nynaeve only breathed out slowly. It was no more than she had expected since the questioning
began. Not that she liked it, but for once no one was going to be able to accuse her of having a temper.
Not when in all probability it would do no good.
Elayne, though, burst out with a sharp, “But—!” Just that, before Sheriam cut in just as sharply.
“You will resume your studies. You are both very strong, but you are not Aes Sedai yet.” Those
green eyes held them until she was sure they had taken it, and then she spoke again, her voice milder.
Milder, but still firm. “You are returned to us, and if Salidar is not the White Tower, you may still
consider it so. From what you have told us in the last hour, there is considerably more you have yet to
tell.” Nynaeve’s breath caught, but Sheriam’s eyes slid back to the a’dam. “A pity you did not bring
the Seanchan woman with you. That, you really should have done.” For some reason, Elayne blushed
bright red, and looked angry at the same time. For herself, Nynaeve was only relieved it was the
Seanchan the woman meant. “But Accepted cannot be called to account for not thinking as Aes
Sedai,” Sheriam went on. “Siuan and Leane will have many questions for you. You will cooperate
with them, and answer to the best of your abilities. I trust I do not have to remind you not to take

advantage of their present condition. Some Accepted, and even some novices, have thought to lay
blame for events, and even take punishments into their own hands.” That mild tone became cold steel.
“Those young women are now extremely sorry for themselves. Need I say more?”
Nynaeve was no more hasty than Elayne to let her know she did not, which was to say they both
almost stammered in their haste to get it out. Nynaeve had not thought of assigning blame—to her
thinking, Aes Sedai were all to blame—but she did not want Sheriam angry with her. Realizing that
fact drove the truth home bitterly; the days of freedom certainly were gone.
“Good. Now you may take the jewels the Panarch gave you, and the arrow—when there is time,
you must tell me why she made you a gift like that—and go. One of the other Accepted will find you
places to sleep. Proper dresses may be harder to come by, but they will be found. I expect you to put
your . . . adventures . . . behind you, and fit smoothly back into your proper place.” Plain although
unspoken was the promise that if they did not fit back in smoothly, they would be smoothed until they
did. Sheriam gave a satisfied nod when she saw they understood.
Beonin had not said a word since the shield of saidar was lowered, but as Nynaeve and Elayne
made their curtsies, the Gray sister rose and strode to the table where their things were laid out. “And
what of this?” she demanded in heavy Taraboner accents, whipping aside the white cloth that covered
the seal on the Dark One’s prison. For a change, her large blue-gray eyes looked more angry than
startled. “Are there to be no more questions about this? Do you all mean to ignore it?” The black-andwhite disc lay there, next to the washleather purse, in a dozen or more pieces, fitted back together as
neatly as they could be.
“It was whole when we put it in the purse.” Nynaeve paused to work moisture back into her
mouth. As much as her eyes had avoided the covering cloth before, they could not leave the seal now.
Leane had smirked when she saw the red dress unwrapped from around its cargo, and said . . . No,
she would not run away from it, even in her head! “Why should we have thought to take special care?
It’s cuendillar!”
“We didn’t look at it,” Elayne said breathlessly, “or touch it more than we had to. It felt filthy,
evil.” It no longer did. Carlinya had made them each hold a piece, demanding to know what evil
feeling they were talking about.
They had said the same things before, more than once, and no one paid them any heed now.
Sheriam rose and went to stand beside the honey-haired Gray. “We are ignoring nothing, Beonin.
Asking these girls more questions will do no good. They have told us what they know.”
“More questions are always good,” Morvrin said, but she had stopped fiddling with the
ter’angreal to stare at the broken seal as hard as anyone else. It might be cuendillar— she and
Beonin had each tested it and said it was—yet she had broken one fragment with her hands.
“How many of the seven still hold?” Myrelle asked softly, as if speaking to herself. “How long
until the Dark One breaks free, and the Last Battle comes?” Every Aes Sedai did some of almost
everything, according to her talents and inclinations, yet each Ajah had its own reason for being.
Greens—who called themselves the Battle Ajah—held themselves ready to face new Dreadlords in
the Last Battle. There was almost a hint of eagerness in Myrelle’s voice.
“Three,” Anaiya said unsteadily. “Three still hold. If we know everything. Let us pray that we
do. Let us pray three are enough.”
“Let us pray those three are stronger than this one,” Morvrin muttered. “Cuendillar cannot be
broken so, not and be cuendillar. It cannot.”
“We will discuss this in due course,” Sheriam said. “After more immediate matters that we can
do something about.” Taking the cloth from Beonin, she covered the broken seal once more. “Siuan,

Leane, we have reached a decision concerning—” She stopped short as she turned and saw Elayne
and Nynaeve. “Were you not told to go?” For all her outward calm, the turmoil inside showed in her
forgetting their presence.
Nynaeve was more than ready to drop another curtsy, blurt a hurried “By your leave, Aes
Sedai,” and scurry for the door. Without moving a muscle, the Aes Sedai—and Siuan and Leane—
watched her and Elayne go. Nynaeve felt their eyes like a shove. Elayne stepped not a whit more
slowly, for all she cast another look at the a’dam.
Once Nynaeve had the door closed and could lean back against its unpainted wood, clutching the
gilded coffer to her breasts, she took her first comfortable breath, or so it seemed, since entering the
old stone inn. She did not want to think about the broken seal. Another broken seal. She would not.
Those women could shear sheep with their eyes. She could almost look forward to watching their
first meeting with the Wise Ones; if she was not likely to be squarely in the middle. It had been more
than difficult when she first went to the Tower, learning to do as she was told by others, to bend her
neck. After long months when she gave the orders—well, once she had consulted Elayne; usually—
she did not know how she was going to learn to pull wool and scratch gravel all over again.
The common room, with its ill-patched plaster ceiling and cold stone fireplaces near collapsing,
was the same beehive it had been when she first entered. No one gave her more than a glance now,
and she gave them less. A small crowd awaited her and Elayne.
Thom and Juilin, on a rough bench against the flaking plaster wall, had their heads together with
Uno, who was squatting in front of them, long sword hilt rising over his shoulder. Areina and Nicola,
both staring amazed at everything and trying not to show it, occupied another bench with Marigan,
who was watching Birgitte attempt to amuse Jaril and Seve by awkwardly juggling three of Thom’s
colored wooden balls. Kneeling behind the boys, Min was tickling them, whispering in their ears, but
they only clung to each other, silently staring with those too-big eyes.
Only two others in the entire room were not scurrying about. Two of Myrelle’s three Warders
happened to be leaning against the wall in conversation a few paces beyond the benches, just this side
of the door back to the kitchen corridor. Croi Makin, a yellow-haired young splinter of stone from
Andor with a fine profile, and Avar Hachami, hawk-nosed and square-chinned with a thick graystreaked mustache like down-curved horns. No one would call Hachami handsome even before his
dark-eyed stare made them swallow. They were not looking at Uno or Thom or anyone else, of
course. It was only happenstance that they alone had nothing to do and had chosen just that spot to do
it. Of course.
Birgitte dropped one of the balls when she saw Nynaeve and Elayne. “What did you tell them?”
she asked quietly, barely glancing at the silver arrow in Elayne’s hand. The quiver hung at her belt;
but her bow was propped against the wall.
Moving closer, Nynaeve carefully did not look toward Makin and Hachami. Just as carefully she
lowered her voice and was sparing with emphasis. “We told them everything they asked for.”
Elayne touched Birgitte’s arm. “They know you are a good friend who has helped us. You are
welcome to stay here, just the same as Areina and Nicola and Marigan.”
Only when some of Birgitte’s tension melted did Nynaeve realize how much had been there. The
blue-eyed woman scooped up the fallen yellow ball and smoothly tossed all three back to Thom, who
snagged them with one hand and made them vanish in a single motion. She wore the faintest of
relieved grins.
“I can’t tell you how glad I am to see the pair of you,” Min said for at least the fourth or fifth
time. Her hair was longer than it had been, though still a dark cap around her head, and she looked

different in some other way that Nynaeve could not put a finger on. Surprisingly, freshly embroidered
flowers climbed the lapels of her coat; she had always worn quite plain clothes before. “A friendly
face is rare around here.” Her eyes flickered just a fraction toward the two Warders. “We have to
settle down alone and have a long talk. I can’t wait to hear what you’ve been up to since you left Tar
Valon.” Or to tell what she had been up to as well, else Nynaeve missed her guess.
“I would like very much to talk to you, too,” Elayne said, quite seriously. Min looked at her, then
sighed and nodded, not as eager as a moment before.
Thom and Juilin and Uno came up behind Birgitte and Min, their faces set in that way men took
on when they meant to say things they thought a woman might not like to hear. Before they could open
their mouths, though, a curly-haired woman in an Accepted’s dress pushed between Juilin and Uno,
glowering at them, and planted herself in front of Nynaeve.
Faolain’s dress, with its seven bands of color at the hem for the Ajahs, was not quite as white as
it should have been, and her dark face wore a scowl. “I am surprised to see you here, wilder. I
thought you had gone running back to your village, and our fine Daughter-Heir to her mother.”
“Are you still souring milk for a hobby, Faolain?” Elayne asked.
Nynaeve kept her face pleasant. Just barely. Twice in the Tower Faolain had been set to teach
her something. To put her in her place, was her own opinion. Even when teacher and pupil were both
Accepted, the teacher had the status of Aes Sedai so long as the lesson lasted, and Faolain took full
advantage. The curly-haired woman had spent eight years as a novice and five more as Accepted; she
was not best pleased that Nynaeve had never had to be a novice at all, or that Elayne had worn pure
white for less than a year. Two lessons from Faolain, and two trips to Sheriam’s study for Nynaeve,
for stubbornness, temper, a list as long as her arm. She made her voice light. “I heard Siuan and
Leane have been badly treated by someone. I think Sheriam means to make an example to end it once
and for all.” She kept her eyes steady on the other woman’s, and Faolain’s widened in alarm.
“I’ve done nothing since Sheriam—” Faolain’s mouth snapped shut, and her face colored
heavily. Min hid her mouth behind her hand, and Faolain jerked her head around, studying the other
women, from Birgitte to Marigan. She motioned brusquely to Nicola and Areina. “You two will do, I
suppose. Come with me. Now. No dawdling.” They rose slowly, Areina staring warily and Nicola
with fingers fretting at the waist of her dress.
Elayne stepped between them and Faolain before Nynaeve could, chin high and eyes imperious
blue ice. “What do you want with them?”
“I am obeying Sheriam Sedai’s orders,” Faolain replied. “I myself think they are too old for first
testing, but I obey orders. A sister accompanies Lord Bryne’s recruiting parties, testing women even
as old as Nynaeve.” Her sudden smile could have come from a viper. “Shall I inform Sheriam Sedai
that you disapprove, Elayne? Shall I tell her you won’t let your retainers be tested?” Elayne’s chin
came down somewhat during that, but of course she could not simply back down. She needed a
diversion.
Nynaeve touched Faolain’s shoulder. “Have they found many?”
In spite of herself, the woman’s head turned, and when she glanced back, Elayne was soothing
Areina and Nicola, explaining that they would not be hurt, or forced into anything. Nynaeve would not
have gone so far. When Aes Sedai found someone with the spark born in her like Elayne or Egwene,
someone who would channel eventually whether she wanted to or not, they were quite open about
bundling her into training whatever her wishes. They seemed more lenient about those who could be
trained but would never touch saidar without it, and about wilders, those who had survived the onein-four chance of teaching themselves, usually without knowing what they had done and often blocked

in some way, as Nynaeve was. Supposedly they could choose to come or stay. Nynaeve had chosen to
enter the Tower, but she suspected that if she had not, she still would have gone, perhaps even tied
hand and foot. Aes Sedai gave women who had the smallest chance of joining them as much choice as
a lamb on a feastday.
“Three,” Faolain said after a moment. “All that effort, and they’ve found three. One a wilder.”
She truly did not like wilders. “I do not know why they are so eager to find new novices. The novices
we have can’t be raised Accepted until we regain the Tower. It is all Siuan Sanche’s fault, her and
Leane.” A muscle in her cheek twitched, as if she realized that remark might be thought to harass the
former Amyrlin and Keeper, and she seized Areina and Nicola each by an arm. “Come along. I obey
orders, and if you’re to be tested, you’ll be tested, waste of time or no waste of time.”
“A nasty woman,” Min murmured, squinting after Faolain as she hurried the other across the
common room. “You’d think, if there was any justice, she would have an unpleasant future ahead of
her.”
Nynaeve wanted to ask what Min had seen in her viewing of the curly-haired Accepted—there
were a hundred questions she wanted to ask her—but Thom and the other two men planted themselves
firmly in front of her and Elayne, Juilin and Uno to either side so among the three they could see in
every direction. Birgitte was leading Jaril and Seve to their mother, keeping her out of it. Min knew
what the men were up to, too, by the rueful look she gave them; she seemed about to say something,
but in the end she only shrugged and joined Birgitte.
By Thom’s face, he could have been about to comment on the weather, or ask what was for
supper. Nothing important. “This place is full of dangerous fools and dreamers. They think they can
depose Elaida. That’s why Gareth Bryne is here. To raise an army for them.”
Juilin’s grin almost split his dark face in two. “Not fools. Madwomen and madmen. I don’t care
if Elaida was there the day Logain was born. They’re mad to think they can pull down an Amyrlin
sitting in the White Tower from here. We could reach Cairhien in a month, maybe.”
“Ragan and a few of the others already have horses marked out for borrowing.” Uno was
grinning, too; it looked incredibly incongruous with that glaring red eye on his patch. “The guards are
set to watch for people coming in, not going out. We can lose them in the forest. It’ll be dark soon.
They’ll never find us.” The women’s donning their Great Serpent rings back by the river had had a
remarkable effect on his language. Though he did seem to make up for it when he thought they could
not hear.
Nynaeve looked at Elayne, who shook her head slightly. Elayne would put up with anything to be
Aes Sedai. And herself? Small chance that they could influence these Aes Sedai to support Rand if
they had decided to try controlling him instead. Make that no chance; she might as well be realistic.
And yet . . . And yet there was Healing. She would learn nothing of it in Cairhien, but here . . . Not ten
paces from her, Therva Maresis, a slender Yellow with a long nose, was methodically ticking off
points on a parchment with her pen. A bald-headed Warder with a black beard stood conferring with
Nisao Dachen near the door, head and shoulders above her despite being no taller than average,
while Dagdara Finchey, as wide as any man in the room and taller than most, addressed a group of
novices in front of one of the unlit fireplaces, briskly sending them off one by one on errands. Nisao
and Dagdara were Yellow Ajah, too; it was said that Dagdara, her graying hair marking considerable
age on an Aes Sedai, knew more of Healing than any two others. It was not as if Nynaeve would be
able to do anything useful if she did go to Rand. Just watch him go mad. If she could progress with
Healing, maybe she could find a way to hold that madness off. There was too much that Aes Sedai
were willing to call hopeless and let go at that to suit her.

All of that flashed through her head in the time it took to look at Elayne and turn back to the men.
“We will be staying here. Uno, if you and the others want to go to Rand, you are free to, as far as I’m
concerned. I fear I no longer have money to help you.” The gold the Aes Sedai had taken was needed
just as they said, but she could not help wincing at the few silvers left in her purse. These men had
followed her—and Elayne, of course—for all the wrong reasons, but that did not lessen her
responsibility for them. Their loyalties were to Rand; they had no reason to enter a struggle for the
White Tower. With a glance at the gilded coffer, she added reluctantly, “But I do have some things
you can sell along the way.”
“You must go, too, Thom,” Elayne said. “And you, Juilin. There’s no point in remaining. We
have no need of you now, but Rand will.” She tried to press her casket of jewels into Thom’s hands,
but he refused to take it.
The three men exchanged looks in that irritating way they had, Uno going so far as to roll his eye.
Nynaeve thought she heard Juilin mutter something under his breath about having said they would be
stubborn.
“Perhaps in a few days,” Thom said.
“A few days,” Juilin agreed.
Uno nodded. “I could do with a little rest if I’m going to be running from Warders halfway to
Cairhien.”
Nynaeve gave them her flattest stare and deliberately tugged her braid. Elayne had her chin as
high as it had ever been, her blue eyes haughty enough to chip ice. Thom and the others surely knew
the signs by now; their nonsense was not going to be allowed. “If you think you are still following
Rand al’Thor’s orders to look after us—” Elayne began in frosty tones at the same time that Nynaeve
said heatedly, “You promised to do as you were told, and I mean to see—”
“Nothing like that,” Thom broke in, brushing back a strand of Elayne’s hair with a gnarled
finger. “Nothing at all like. Can’t an old man with a limp want a little rest?”
“To tell the truth,” Juilin said, “I am just staying because Thom owes me money. Dice.”
“Do you expect us to steal twenty horses from Warders like falling out of bed?” Uno growled.
He seemed to have forgotten just offering to do exactly that.
Elayne stared, at a loss for words, and Nynaeve was having difficulty finding them herself. How
far they had fallen. Not so much as a shifted foot in the three of them. The trouble was that she was
torn. She had determined to send them away. She had, and not because she didn’t want them around
watching her curtsy and scrape right and left. Not at all. Yet with almost nothing in Salidar as she had
expected, she had to admit, however reluctantly, that it would be . . . comforting . . . to know she and
Elayne had more than Birgitte to depend on. Not that she would take up the offer of escape, of course
—if that was what it should be called—not under any circumstances. Their presence would just be
. . . comforting. Certainly not that she would let them know that. She would not have to, since they
were going, whatever they thought. Rand could find use for them, very probably, and they would only
get in the way here. Except . . .
The unpainted door opened, and Siuan stalked out, followed by Leane. They stared at each other
coldly before Leane sniffed and glided away, startlingly sinuous as she vanished around Croi and
Avar into the corridor that led to the kitchens. Nynaeve frowned slightly. In the midst of all that
iciness there had been one instant, a brief flicker she almost missed with it right in front of her. . . .
Siuan swung toward her, then abruptly stopped short, her face going blank. Someone else had
joined the small gathering.
Gareth Bryne, dented breastplate buckled over his plain buff-colored coat and steel-backed

gauntlets tucked behind his sword belt, radiated command. Mostly gray hair and a bluff face gave him
the appearance of a man who had seen everything, endured everything; a man who could endure
anything.
Elayne smiled, nodding graciously. A far cry from her astonished stares, coming into Salidar,
when she had first recognized him at the length of the street. “I will not say it is entirely good to see
you, Lord Gareth. I have heard of some difficulty between Mother and you, but I am sure it can be
mended. You know Mother is hasty sometimes. She will come ’round, and ask you back to your
proper place in Caemlyn, you may be certain of it.”
“Done is done, Elayne.” Ignoring her astonishment—Nynaeve doubted anyone who knew
Elayne’s rank had ever been so curt to her—he turned to Uno. “Have you thought on what I said?
Shienarans are the finest heavy cavalry in the world, and I have lads who are just right for proper
training.”
Uno frowned, his one eye sliding to Elayne and Nyfiaeve. Slowly, he nodded. “I’ve nothing
better to do. I’ll ask the others.”
Bryne clapped him on the shoulder. “Well enough. And you, Thom Merrilin.” Thom had half
turned away at the other man’s approach, knuckling his mustaches and staring at the floor as if to
obscure his face. Now he met Bryne’s level stare with one of his own. “I once knew a fellow with a
name much like yours,” Bryne said. “A skilled player of a certain game.”
“I once knew a fellow who looked much like you,” Thom replied. “He tried hard to put me in
chains. I think he’d have cut my head off if he ever laid hands on me.”
“A long time ago, that would be? Men do strange things for women sometimes.” Bryne glanced
at Siuan and shook his head. “Will you join me for a game of stones, Master Merrilin? I sometimes
find myself wishing for a man who knows the game well, the way it’s played in lofty circles.”
Thom’s bushy white eyebrows drew down almost as far as Uno’s had, but he never took his eyes
from Bryne. “I might play a game or two,” he said finally, “once I know the stakes. As long as you
understand I don’t intend to spend the rest of my life playing stones with you. I don’t like staying too
long in one place anymore. My feet itch, sometimes.”
“So long as they don’t itch in the middle of a crucial game,” Bryne told him dryly. “The two of
you come with me. And don’t expect much sleep. Around here, everything needs doing yesterday,
except what should have been done last week.” Pausing, he looked at Siuan again. “My shirts came
back only half clean today.” With that he was leading Thom and Uno off. Siuan glared at his back,
then shifted her frown to Min, and Min grimaced and darted off the way Leane had gone.
Nynaeve did not understand that last exchange at all. And the nerve of those men, thinking they
could talk over her head—or under her nose, or whatever—without her understanding every word.
Enough of them, anyway.
“A good thing he has no need for a thief-catcher,” Juilin said, eyeing Siuan sideways, and
plainly uncomfortable. He had not gotten over the shock of learning her name; Nynaeve was not sure
he had taken in about her being stilled, and no longer the Amyrlin Seat. He certainly shifted his feet
for her. “This way I can sit and talk. I’ve seen a lot of fellows who look like they might unwind over
a mug of ale.”
“He practically ignored me,” Elayne said incredulously. “I don’t care what the trouble is
between him and Mother, he has no right. . . . Well, I will tend to Lord Gareth Bryne later. I have to
talk to Min, Nynaeve.”
Nynaeve started to follow as Elayne hurried toward that hall to the kitchens—Min would give
straight answers—but Siuan caught her arm in an iron grip.

The Siuan Sanche who had meekly ducked her head before those Aes Sedai was gone. No one
here wore the shawl. Her voice never rose; it did not need to. She fixed Juilin with a stare that had
him almost jumping out of his skin. “You watch what questions you ask, thief-catcher, or you’ll gut
yourself for market.” Those cold blue eyes shifted to Birgitte and Marigan. Marigan’s mouth twisted
as if she tasted something bad, and even Birgitte blinked. “You two find an Accepted named Theodrin
and ask her about somewhere to sleep tonight. Those children look as if they should be in bed
already. Well? Move your feet!” Before they had stirred a step—and Birgitte was moving as quickly
as Marigan, maybe quicker—she rounded on Nynaeve. “You, I have questions for. You were told to
cooperate, and I suggest you do if you know what’s good for you.”
It was like being caught in a high wind. Before Nynaeve knew it, Siuan was hurrying her up
rickety steps with a railing cobbled together from unpainted wood, hustling her down a rough-floored
corridor to a tiny room with two cramped beds built into the wall, one above the other. Siuan took the
only stool, motioning her to sit on the lower bed. Nynaeve chose to stand, if only to show she was not
going to be pushed. There was not much else in the room. A washstand with a brick propping up one
leg held a chipped pitcher and basin. A few dresses hung from pegs, and what appeared to be a pallet
lay rolled up in one corner. Nynaeve had fallen far in the space of a day, but Siuan had fallen farther
than she could imagine. She did not think she would have too much trouble with the woman. Even if
Siuan did still have the same eyes.
Siuan sniffed. “Suit yourself, then, girl. The ring. It doesn’t require channeling?”
“No. You heard me tell Sheriam—”
“Anyone can use it? A woman who can’t channel? A man?”
“Possibly a man.” Ter’angreal that did not need the Power usually worked for men or women.
“For any woman, yes.”
“Then you are going to teach me to use it.”
Nynaeve raised one eyebrow. This might be a lever to get what she wanted. If not, she had
another. Maybe. “Do they know about this? All the talk was of showing them how it works. You were
never mentioned.”
“They don’t know.” Siuan did not appear shaken at all. She even smiled, and not pleasantly.
“And they won’t. Else they’ll learn you and Elayne have been posing as full sisters since you left Tar
Valon. Moiraine might be letting Egwene get away with it—if she hasn’t tried it, too, I don’t know a
bar knot from a running hitch—but Sheriam, Carlinya . . . ? They’ll have you squealing like a
spawning grunter before they’re done. Long before.”
“That’s ridiculous.” Nynaeve realized she was sitting on the edge of the bed. She did not
remember sitting down. Thom and Juilin would hold their tongues. No one else knew. She had to talk
to Elayne. “We haven’t pretended anything of the sort.”
“Don’t lie to me, girl. If I needed confirmation, your eyes gave it. Your stomach is turning
somersaults, isn’t it?”
It most certainly was. “Of course not. If I teach you anything, it’s because I want to.” She was not
going to let this woman bully her. The last vestige of pity winked out. “If I do, I want something in
return. To study you and Leane. I want to know if stilling can be Healed.”
“It can’t,” Siuan said flatly. “Now—”
“Anything short of death should be.”
“ ‘Should be’ isn’t ‘is,’ girl. Leane and I were promised we would be left alone. Speak to
Faolain or Emara if you want to know what happens to anyone who molests us. They weren’t the first
or the worst, but they cried the longest.”

Her other lever. Near panic had driven it right out of her head. If it existed. One glance. “What
would Sheriam say if she knew you and Leane weren’t ready to tear out each other’s hair at all?”
Siuan just looked at her. “They think you’re tamed, don’t they? The more you snap at anybody who
can’t snap back, the more they take it for proof when you leap to obey every time an Aes Sedai
coughs. Was a little cringing all it took to make them forget the two of you had worked hand-in-hand
for years? Or did you convince them stilling had changed everything about you, not just your face?
When they find out you’ve been scheming behind their backs, manipulating them, you’ll howl louder
than any grunter. Whatever that is.” Not so much as a blink. Siuan was not going to loose her temper
and let any admissions slip out. Yet there had been something in that brief look; Nynaeve was sure of
it. “I want to study you—and Leane—whenever I want. And Logain.” Perhaps she could learn
something there as well. Men were different; it would be like looking at the problem from another
angle. Not that she would Heal him even if she discovered how. Rand’s channeling was necessary.
She was not about to loose another man on the world who could wield the Power. “If not, then you
can forget about the ring, and Tel’aran’rhiod.” What was Siuan after there? Probably just to revisit
something that at least seemed like being Aes Sedai. Nynaeve stamped firmly on momentarily
rekindled pity. “And if you make any claims about us pretending to be Aes Sedai, then I’ll have no
choice but to tell about you and Leane. Elayne and I might be uncomfortable until the truth comes out,
but it will, and the truth will make you weep as long as Faolain and Emara together.”
Silence stretched. How did the other woman manage to look so cool? Nynaeve had always
thought it had to do with being Aes Sedai. Her lips felt dry, the only part of her that did. If she was
wrong, if Siuan was willing to put it to the test, she knew who would be weeping.
Finally, Siuan muttered, “I hope Moiraine has managed to keep Egwene’s backbone more supple
than this.” Nynaeve did not understand, but she hardly had time to consider it. The next instant, the
other woman was leaning forward, hand outstretched. “You keep my secrets, and I will keep yours.
Teach me the ring, and you can study stilling and gentling to your heart’s content.”
Nynaeve barely managed to hold in a relieved sigh as she clasped the offered hand. She had
done it. For the first time in what seemed forever, someone had tried to bully her and failed. She
almost felt ready to face Moghedien. Almost.
Elayne caught up with Min just outside the back door of the inn and fell in beside her. Min had
what looked like two or three white shirts wadded under one arm. The sun sat on the treetops, and in
the fading light the stableyard had the soft look of dirt not long turned, with a huge stump that might
have belonged to an oak right in the middle. The thatch-roofed stone stable had no doors, allowing a
good look at men moving among filled stalls. Surprisingly, Leane was talking to a large man on the
edge of the stable’s shadow. Roughly dressed, he looked a blacksmith, or a brawler. What was
surprising was how close Leane stood, head tilted as she stared up at him. And then she actually
patted his cheek before turning away and hurrying back into the inn. The big man stared after her a
moment, then melted into the shadows.
“Don’t ask me what she’s up, to,” Min said. “Strange people come to see Siuan or her, and some
of the men, she . . . Well, you saw.”
Elayne did not really care what Leane did. But now that she had Min alone, she did not know
how to bring up what she wanted. “What are you doing?”
“Laundry,” Min muttered, shifting the shirts irritably. “I can’t tell you how good it is to see Siuan
the mouse for once. She doesn’t know whether the eagle is going to eat her or make her a pet, but she
has the same choice she gives everybody else. None!”

Elayne quickened her pace to keep up as they crossed the stableyard. Whatever that was about, it
gave no opening. “Did you know what Thom was going to suggest? We are staying.”
“I told them you would. Not a viewing.” Min’s step slowed again as they started between the
stable and a crumbling stone wall, down a dim alley of brush stubble and trampled weeds. “I just
didn’t think you would give up the chance to study again. You were always eager. Nynaeve, too, even
if she won’t admit it. I wish I’d been wrong. I’d go with you. At least, I . . .” She muttered something
furious-sounding under her breath. “Those three you brought with you are trouble, and that is a
viewing.”
There it was. The crack she needed. But instead of asking what she had intended, she said, “You
mean Marigan and Nicola and Areina? How can they be trouble?” Only a fool passed over what Min
saw.
“I don’t know exactly. I only caught glimpses of aura, and just out of the corner of my eye. Never
when I was looking right at them, where I might have made something out. There aren’t many who
have auras all the time, you know. Trouble. Maybe they’ll carry tales. Were you up to anything you
wouldn’t want the Aes Sedai to know about?”
“Certainly not,” Elayne said briskly. Min looked at her sideways, and she added, “Well, nothing
we didn’t have to do. They can’t possibly know about it anyway.” This was not taking her where she
wanted to go. Drawing a deep breath, she leaped off the cliff. “Min, you had a viewing about Rand
and me, didn’t you?” She went two steps before she realized the other woman had stopped.
“Yes.” It was a wary word.
“You saw that we were going to fall in love.”
“Not exactly. I saw you’d fall in love with him. I don’t know what he feels for you, only that he’s
tied to you some way.”
Elayne’s mouth tightened. That was about what she had expected, but not what she wanted to
hear. “Wish” and “want” trip the feet, but “is” makes the path smoother. That was what Lini said.
You had to deal with what was, not what you wished was. “And you saw there would be someone
else. Someone I’d have to . . . share . . . him with.”
“Two,” Min said hoarsely. “Two others. And . . . And I’m one.”
Mouth already open for the next question, for a moment Elayne could only stare. “You?” she got
out at last.
Min bristled. “Yes, me! Do you think I can’t fall in love? I didn’t want to, but I did, and that’s
that.” She stalked past Elayne down the alleyway, and this time Elayne was slower to catch up.
It certainly explained a few things. How nervously Min had always sidestepped talking about it.
The embroidery on her lapels. And unless she was imagining it, Min was wearing rouge, too. How do
I feel about it? she wondered. She could not sort it out. “Who is the third?” she asked quietly.
“I don’t know,” Min mumbled. “Only that she has a temper. Not Nynaeve, thank the Light.” She
gave a weak laugh. “I don’t think I could have survived that.” Once more she gave Elayne a cautious
sidelong look. “What does this mean between you and me? I like you. I never had a sister, but
sometimes I feel like you. . . . I want to be your friend, Elayne, and I won’t stop liking you whatever
happens, but I can’t stop loving him.”
“I don’t very much like the idea of having to share a man,” Elayne said stiffly. That was certainly
an understatement.
“Me, neither. Only . . . Elayne, it shames me to admit it, but I will take him any way I can get
him. Not that either of us has much choice. Light, he’s scrambled my whole life. Just thinking about
him scrambles my brains.” Min sounded as if she did not know whether to laugh or cry.

Elayne exhaled slowly. Not Min’s fault. Was it better that it was Min rather than, say, Berelain
or somebody else she could not abide? “Ta’veren,” she said. “He bends the world around him. We
are chips caught in a whirlpool. But I seem to recall you and me and Egwene saying we’d never let a
man come between us being friends. We will work it out somehow, Min. And when we find out who
the third is . . . Well, we’ll work that out, as well. Somehow.” A third! Could she be Berelain? Oh,
blood and ashes!
“Somehow,” Min said bleakly. “Meanwhile, you and I are caught here in a leg trap. I know
there’s another, I know I can’t do anything about it, but I had enough trouble reconciling myself to you,
and . . . Cairhienin women aren’t all like Moiraine. I saw a Cairhienin noblewoman in Baerlon once.
On the surface, she made Moiraine look like Leane, but sometimes she said things, hinting. And her
auras! I don’t think a man in the whole town was safe alone with her, not unless he was ugly, lame,
and better yet, dead.”
Elayne sniffed, but she managed to make her voice light. “Never you mind about that. We have
another sister, you and I, one you’ve never met. Aviendha is keeping a close eye on Rand, and he
doesn’t go ten steps without a guard of Aiel Maidens of the Spear.” A Cairhienin woman? At least
she had met Berelain, knew something of her. No. She was not going to fret over it like some
brainless girl. A grown woman dealt with the world as it was and made the best of it. Who could it
be?
They had come out into an open yard dotted with cold ashes. Huge kettles, most pitted where rust
had been scrubbed away, stood against the encircling stone wall, which had been toppled in several
places by trees growing up in it. Despite the shadows crossing the yard, two steaming kettles still sat
on flames, and three novices, hair sweat-soaked and white skirts tied up, were hard at work on scrub
boards stuck into broad washpots full of soapy water.
With a glance at the shirts under Min’s arm, Elayne embraced saidar. “Let me help you with
those.” Channeling to do assigned chores was forbidden—physical labor built character, so they said
—but this could not be counted the same. If she swirled the shirts around in the water violently
enough, there should be no reason to get their hands wet. “Tell me everything. Are Siuan and Leane as
changed as they seem? How did you get here? Is Logain really here? And why are you laundering
some man’s shirts? Everything.”
Min laughed, plainly pleased to change the subject. “ ‘Everything’ will take a week. But I’ll try.
First, I helped Siuan and Leane get out of the dungeon Elaida had stuck them in, and then . . .”
Making appropriate sounds of amazement, Elayne channeled Air to lift one of the boiling kettles
clear of its flames. She hardly noticed the novices’ incredulous stares; she was used to her own
strength now, and it rarely occurred to her that she did things, without thinking, that some full Aes
Sedai could not do at all. Who was the third woman? Aviendha had better be keeping a close eye on
him.

News Comes to Cairhien

A thin thread of blue smoke rising from the plain, short-stemmed pipe clenched in his teeth,
Rand rested one hand on the balcony’s stone railing and looked into the garden below. Sharp
shadows were lengthening; the sun was a red ball falling through a cloudless sky. Ten days in
Cairhien, and this seemed the first moment he had stood still when he was not asleep. Selande stood
close by his side, pale face tilted up to watch him, not the garden. Her hair was not so elaborately
done as that of a woman of higher rank, but it still added half a foot to her height. He tried to ignore
her, but it was difficult to ignore a woman who insisted on pressing her firm bosom against your arm.
The meeting had gone on long enough for him to want a moment’s break. He had known it for a
mistake as soon as Selande followed him out.
“I know a secluded pool,” she said softly, “where this heat might be escaped. A sheltered pool,
where nothing would disturb us.” The music of Asmodean’s harp drifted out through the square arches
behind them. Something light, cool sounding.
Rand puffed a little more vigorously. The heat. Nothing compared to the Waste, but . . . Autumn
should be coming on, yet the afternoon felt like the depths of summer. A rainless summer. Shirtsleeved men in the garden were spreading water from buckets, doing it late to avoid evaporation, but
too much was brown or dying. The weather could not be natural. The burning sun mocked him.
Moiraine agreed, and Asmodean, but neither knew what to do or how, any more than he did.
Sammael. Sammael he could do something about.
“Cool water,” Selande murmured, “and you and I alone.” She snuggled closer, though he did not
see how it was possible.
He wondered when the next taunt would come. No dashing off in a temper, whatever Sammael
did. Once his methodical buildup in Tear was done, then he would loose the lightning. One crushing
stroke to put an end to Sammael, and add Illian to his bag at the same time. With Illian, Tear and
Cairhien, plus an army of Aiel big enough to overwhelm any nation in weeks, he . . .
“Would you not like to swim? I do not swim well myself, but surely you will teach me.”
Rand sighed. For a moment he wished Aviendha was there. No. The last thing he wanted was a
bruised Selande running screaming with her clothes half torn off.
Hooding his eyes, he looked down at her and spoke quietly around his pipe. “I can channel.” She
blinked, drawing back without moving a muscle. They never understood why he would bring that up;
for them it was something to be glossed over, ignored if possible. “They say I’ll go mad. But I’m not
mad yet. Not yet.” He chuckled from deep in his chest, then cut it off abruptly, made his face blank.
“Teach you to swim? I’ll hold you up in the water with the Power. Saidin is tainted, you know. The
Dark One’s touch. You won’t feel it, though. All around you, but you’ll not feel a thing.” Another

chuckle, with a hint of a wheeze. Her dark eyes were as wide and round as they would go, her smile a
sickly rictus. “Later, then. I want to be alone, to think about . . .” He bent as if to kiss her, and with a
squeak, she dropped a curtsy so sudden that at first he thought her legs had collapsed.
Backing away, curtsying hurriedly at every other step, she babbled about the honor of serving
him, her deepest wish to serve him, all in a voice on the brink of hysteria, until she bumped into one
of the square arches. A final, half-bend of her knees, and she darted inside.
With a grimace, he turned back to the railing. Frightening women. She would have made excuses
had he asked her to leave him, would have taken a command as only a temporary setback unless it
was to stay out of his sight, and even then. . . . Maybe word would spread this time. He had to keep a
short rein on his temper; it ran away too easily of late. It was the drought he could do nothing about,
the problems that sprang up like weeds wherever he looked. A few moments more alone with his
pipe. Who would rule a nation when he could have easier work, such as carrying water uphill in a
sieve?
Across the garden, between two of the Royal Palace’s stepped towers, he had a view of
Cairhien, harshly lit and shadowed, mastering the hills more than flowing over them. His crimson flag
with the ancient Aes Sedai symbol hung limply above one of those two towers, a long copy of the
Dragon Banner over the other. That one flew a dozen places in the city, including the tallest of the
great unfinished towers, right in front of him. Shouting had done as little as orders there; neither
Tairens nor Cairhienin could believe he really meant that he only wanted one, and Aiel did not care
about banners one way or another.
Even now, deep inside the palace, he could hear the murmur of a city jammed to bursting.
Refugees from every corner of the land, more afraid to return to their homes than they were to have
the Dragon Reborn in their midst. Merchants seeping in, selling whatever people could afford to buy
and buying whatever people could not afford to keep. Lords and armed men rallying to his banner, or
to someone’s. Hunters for the Horn thinking it must be found near him; a dozen Foregaters, or a
hundred, were ready to sell it to any of them. Ogier stonemasons down from Stedding Tsofu to see if
there was work for their fabled skills. Adventurers, some of whom might have been bandits a week
gone, come to see what they could pick up. There had even been a hundred or so Whitecloaks, though
they had galloped out as soon as it was clear the siege had been lifted. Did Pedron Niall’s ingathering
of the Whitecloaks concern him? Egwene gave him hints of things, but she saw matters from the White
Tower, wherever she stood. The Aes Sedai point of view was not his.
At least the wagon trains full of grain were beginning to arrive from Tear with some regularity.
Hungry people could riot. He wished he could have simply left it at being glad they were not so
hungry anymore, but there it was. The bandits were fewer. And the civil war had not resumed. Yet.
More good news. He had to make certain it stayed that way before he could leave. A hundred things
to take care of before he could go after Sammael. Only Rhuarc and Bael remained of the chiefs he
really trusted, those who had marched from Rhuidean with him. But if the four clans who had joined
him late could not be trusted on the march to Tear, could he trust them loose in Cairhien? Indirian and
the others had acknowledged him as Car’a’carn, but they knew him as little as he knew them. The
message that morning might be a problem. Berelain, First of Mayene, was only a few hundred miles
south of the city, on her way to join him with a small army; he had no idea how she had led it across
Tear. Oddly, her letter had asked if Perrin was with him. No doubt she feared Rand might forget her
small country if she did not remind him. It might almost be a pleasure to watch her spar with the
Cairhienin, the latest in a long line of Firsts who had managed to keep Tear from swallowing their
country by playing the Game of Houses. Perhaps if he put her in charge here . . . He would be taking

Meilan and the other Tairens with him when the time came. If it ever came.
This was no better than what was waiting inside. Tapping the dottle from his pipe, he ground out
the tabac’s last sparks under his boot. No need to risk fire to the garden; it would go up like a torch.
The drought. The unnatural weather. He realized he was snarling silently. First work on what he knew
he could do something about. It took an effort to smooth his face before he went in.
Asmodean, as well dressed as any lord, with falls of lace at his neck, plucked a soothing melody
from his harp in one corner, leaning against the dark severe paneling as if lounging at his leisure. The
others who were sitting bobbed out of their chairs at Rand’s appearance, and back down at his sharp
gesture. Meilan, Torean and Aracome occupied carved-and-gilded chairs on one side of the deep red
and gold carpet, each with a young Tairen lord at his back, mirroring the Cairhienin on the other side.
Dobraine and Maringil had a young lord apiece behind them, too, each with the front of his head
shaved and powdered like Dobraine’s. A white-faced Selande stood at Colavaere’s shoulder, and
trembled when Rand looked at her.
Schooling his face, he strode down the carpet to his own chair. That chair alone was reason to
control his features. It was a new gift from Colavaere and the other two, in what they imagined was
the Tairen style. He must like Tairen gaudiness; he ruled Tear, had sent them here. Carved Dragons
held it up, all sparkling red and gold with enamel and gilt, and great sunstones for their golden eyes.
Two more made the arms, and others climbed the tall back. Countless craftsmen must have gone
without sleep since his arrival to make the thing. He felt like a fool sitting on it. Asmodean’s music
had changed; it had a grand sound, now, a triumphal march.
And yet, there was an added wariness in those dark Cairhienin eyes watching him, a wariness
reflected in the Tairens. It had been there before he went outside, too. Perhaps in attempting to curry
favor they had made a mistake that was only now dawning on them. They had all tried to ignore who
he was, pretend he was simply some young lord who had conquered them, who could be dealt with
and manipulated. That chair—that throne—held up in front of them who and what he really was.
“Are the soldiers moving on schedule, Lord Dobraine?” The harp faded away as soon as he
opened his mouth, Asmodean apparently absorbed in preening it.
The leathery man smiled grimly. “They are, my Lord Dragon.” No more than that. Rand had no
illusions that Dobraine liked him more than any of the others did, or that he would not try to gain
advantage where he could, but Dobraine actually seemed ready to hold to the oath he had sworn. The
colorful slashes down the chest of his coat were worn from a breastplate being buckled over them.
Maringil shifted forward on his chair, whip-slender and tall for a Cairhienin, white hair almost
touching his shoulders. His forehead was not shaved, and his coat, stripes nearly to his knees, bore no
visible wear. “We need those men here, my Lord Dragon.” Hawk’s eyes blinked at the gilded throne,
focused on Rand again. “There are many bandits at large in the land yet.” He shifted again, so he did
not have to look at the Tairens. Meilan and the other two were smiling faintly.
“I have set Aiel to hunting bandits,” Rand said. They did have orders to sweep up any brigands
in their path. And to not go out of their way to find them. Even Aiel could not do that and move
quickly. “I’m told that three days ago, Stone Dogs killed nearly two hundred near Morelle.” That was
near the southernmost line claimed by Cairhien in recent years, halfway to the River Iralell. No need
to let this lot know that those Aiel might be as far as the river by now. They could cover long
distances faster than horses.
Maringil persisted, frowning uneasily. “There is another reason. Half of our land west of the
Alguenya is in the hands of Andor.” He hesitated. They all knew Rand had grown up in Andor; a
dozen rumors made him a son of one Andoran House or another, even a son of Morgase herself, either

cast off because he could channel or fled before he could be gentled. The slender man went on as if
tiptoeing barefoot and blindfolded among daggers. “Morgase does not seem to be reaching for more
as yet, but what she has already must be taken back. Her heralds have even proclaimed her right to the
—” He stopped abruptly. None of them knew who Rand meant the Sun Throne for. Maybe it was
Morgase.
Colavaere’s dark gaze had Rand on balance scales again; she had said little today. She would
not until she learned why Selande’s face was so white.
Suddenly Rand was tired, of nobles balking, of all the manueyering in Daes Dae’mar. “Andoran
claims to Cairhien will be taken care of when I am ready. Those soldiers will go to Tear. You will
follow the High Lord Meilan’s good example of obedience, and I’ll hear no more on it.” He swung
toward the Tairens. “Your example is a good one, Meilan, isn’t it? And yours, Aracome? If I ride out
tomorrow, I won’t find a thousand Defenders of the Stone camped ten miles south who were
supposed to be on their way back to Tear two days ago, will I? Or two thousand armsmen from
Tairen Houses?”
Those faint smiles faded with each word. Meilan became very still, dark eyes glittering, and
Aracome’s narrow face went pale, whether from anger or fear it was hard to say. Torean dabbed at
his lumpy face with a silk handkerchief pulled from his sleeve. Rand ruled in Tear, and meant to rule;
Callandor driven into the Heart of the Stone proved that. That was why they had not protested against
his sending Tairen soldiers to Cairhien. They thought to carve new estates, perhaps kingdoms, here,
far from where he ruled.
“You will not, my Lord Dragon,” Meilan said finally. “Tomorrow I will ride with you so you
may see for yourself.”
Rand did not doubt it. A rider would be dispatched south as soon as the man could arrange it,
and by tomorrow those soldiers would be far on toward Tear. It would do. For now. “I am done,
then. You may leave me.”
A few starts of surprise, masked so quickly they might have been imagined, and they were rising,
bowing and curtsying, Selande and the young lords backing away. They had expected more. An
audience with the Dragon Reborn was always long, and tortuous as they saw it, with him firmly
bending them the way he meant them to go, whether it was declaring that no Tairen could claim lands
in Cairhien without marrying into a Cairhienin House, or refusing to allow the expulsion of
Foregaters, or making laws apply to nobles that had never applied to any but commoners before.
His eyes followed Selande for a moment. She was not the first in the last ten days. Nor the tenth,
or even the twentieth. He had been tempted, at least at first. When he rejected slender, plump
promptly replaced her, as tall or dark, for Cairhienin anyway, replaced short or fair. A constant
search for the woman who would please him. The Maidens turned back those who tried to sneak into
his quarters at night, firmly but more gently than Aviendha had handled the one she caught. Aviendha
apparently took Elayne’s ownership of him with little short of deadly seriousness. Yet her Aiel sense
of humor seemed to find tormenting him very satisfying; he had seen the satisfaction on her face when
he groaned and hid his face as she started undressing for the night. Thus he could have resented her
deadly seriousness if he had not quickly understood what was behind that string of pretty young
women.
“My Lady Colavaere.”
She stopped as soon as he spoke her name, cool-eyed and calm beneath her ornate tower of dark
curls. Selande had no choice but to remain with her, though she was plainly as reluctant to stay as the
others were to go. Meilan and Maringil bowed themselves out last, so intent on Colavaere and trying

to puzzle out why she had been called to stay that they did not realize they were side by side. Their
eyes were a perfect match, dark and predatory.
The dark-paneled door closed. “Selande is very pretty young woman,” Rand said. “But some
prefer the company of a more mature . . . more knowledgeable . . . woman. You will sup alone with
me tonight, when Second Even is rung. I look forward to the pleasure.” He waved her away before
she could say anything, if she could have. Her face did not change, but her curtsy was a trifle
unsteady. Selande looked purely amazed. And infinitely relieved.
Once the door had closed again, behind the two women, Rand threw back his head and laughed.
A harsh, sardonic laugh. He was tired of the Game of Houses, so he played it without thinking. He
was disgusted with himself for frightening one woman, so he frightened another. It was reason enough
to laugh. Colavaere stood behind that line of young women who had been flinging themselves at him.
Find a bedpartner for the Lord Dragon, a young woman whose strings she pulled, and Colavaere
would have a string tied firmly to Rand. But it was some other woman she meant to bed, and perhaps
even marry, the Dragon Reborn. Now she would sweat all the hours until Second Even. She had to
know she was pretty, if short of beautiful, and if he rebuffed all the young women she sent, perhaps it
was because he wanted one with another fifteen or so years. And she would be certain she did not
dare say no to the man who held Cairhien in his fist. By tonight, she should be amenable, should stop
this idiocy. Aviendha would very likely slit the throat of any woman she found in his bed; besides, he
had no time for all these easily frightened doves thinking to sacrifice themselves for Cairhien and
Colavaere, There were too many problems to deal with, and no time.
Light, what if Colavaere decides it’s worth the sacrifice? She might. She was easily coldblooded enough. Then I’ll have to see that it’s cold with fear. It would not be difficult. He could
sense saidin like something just beyond the edge of sight. He could feel the taint on it. Sometimes he
thought that what he felt was the taint in him, now, the dregs left by saidin.
He found that he was glaring at Asmodean. The man seemed to be studying him, face
expressionless. The music resumed again, like water babbling over stones, soothing. So he needed
soothing, did he?
The door opened without a knock, admitting Moiraine, Egwene and Aviendha together, the
younger women’s Aiel garb framing the Aes Sedai’s pale blue. For anyone else, even Rhuarc or
another chief still near the city or yet another delegation of Wise Ones, a Maiden would have entered
to announce them. These three the Maidens sent on in even if he was taking a bath. Egwene glanced at
“Natael” and grimaced, and the tune became lower, and for a moment intricate, perhaps a dance,
before settling to what might have been the sighing of breezes. The man wore a twisted smile,
directed at his harp.
“I’m surprised to see you, Egwene,” Rand said. He swung his leg over the arm of the chair.
“What is it—six days you’ve been avoiding me? Have you brought me more good news? Has
Masema sacked Amador in my name? Or have these Aes Sedai you say support me turned out to be
Black Ajah? You notice I don’t ask who they are, or where. Not even how you know. I don’t ask you
to divulge Aes Sedai secrets, or Wise Ones’ secrets, or whatever they are. Just give me the driblets
you’re willing to dole out, and let me worry whether what you don’t care to tell me will stab me in
the night.”
She looked at him calmly. “You know what you need to know. And I will not tell you what you
do not need to know.” That was what she had said six days ago. She was as much Aes Sedai as
Moiraine, for all one wore Aiel garb and the other pale blue silk.
There was nothing calm about Aviendha. She moved to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Egwene,

green eyes flashing, back so straight it might have been iron. He was half surprised Moiraine did not
join them, so they could all three glare at him. Her vow of obedience left a startling amount of room,
it seemed, and the three seemed to have become close since his argument with Egwene. Not that it had
been much of an argument; you could not argue very well with a woman who watched with cool eyes,
never raised her voice, and after one refusal to answer declined even to acknowledge your question
again.
“What do you want?” he said.
“These came for you in the last hour,” Moiraine said, extending two folded letters. Her voice
seemed to fit Asmodean’s chime-like tune.
Rand rose to take them suspiciously. “If they’re for me, how did they come into your hands?”
One was addressed to “Rand al’Thor” in an exact, angular hand, the other to “The Lord Dragon
Reborn” in script flowing yet no less precise. The seals were unbroken. A second look made him
blink. The two seals seemed to be the same red wax, and one bore the impression of the Flame of Tar
Valon, the other a tower overlaid on what he recognized as the island of Tar Valon.
“Perhaps because of where they came from,” Moiraine replied, “and from whom.” It was no
explanation, but it was as much as he would get unless he demanded more. Even then he would have
to prod her through every step. She kept her vow, but in her own way. “There are no poison needles
in the seals. And no traps woven.”
He paused with his thumb against the Flame of Tar Valon—he had not thought of either—then
broke it. Another Flame in red wax stood beside the signature, Elaida do Avriny a’Roihan in a hasty
scrawl above her titles. The rest was in the angular hand.
There can be no denial that you are the one prophesied, yet many will try to destroy you for
what else you are. For the sake of the world, this cannot be allowed. Two nations have bent
knee to you, and the savage Aiel as well, but the power of thrones is as dust beside the One
Power. The White Tower will shelter and protect you against those who refuse to see what
must be. The White Tower will see that you live to see Tarmon Gai’don. None else can do this.
An escort of Aes Sedai will come to bring you to Tar Valon with the honor and respect you
deserve. This I pledge to you.
“She doesn’t even ask,” he said wryly. He remembered Elaida well for having met her only
once. A woman hard enough to make Moiraine seem a kitten. The “honor and respect” he deserved.
He would wager that the escort of Aes Sedai just happened to number thirteen.
Passing Elaida’s letter back to Moiraine, he opened the other. The page was covered in the same
hand that had addressed it.
With respect, I humbly beg to make myself known to the great Lord Dragon Reborn, whom
the Light blesses as savior of the world.
All the world must stand in awe of you, who has conquered Cairhien in one day as you did
Tear. Yet be wary, I beseech you, for your splendor will inspire jealousy even in those not
toiled in the Shadow. Even here in the White Tower are the blind who cannot see your true
radiance, which will illumine us all. Yet know that some rejoice in your coming, and will
delight to serve your glory. We are not those who would steal your luster for ourselves, but
rather those who would kneel to bask in your brilliance. You shall save the world, according
to the Prophecies, and the world shall be yours.
To my shame, I must beg you to let no one see these words, and to destroy them when once
read. I stand, naked of your protection, among some who would usurp your power, and I

cannot know who around you is as faithful as I. I am told that Moiraine Damodred may be
with you. She may serve you devotedly, obeying your words as law, as I will, yet I cannot
know, for I remember her as a secretive woman, much given to plotting, as Cairhienin are.
Yet even if you believe she is your creature, as I, I beg you to keep this missive secret, even
from her. My life lies beneath your fingers, my Lord Dragon Reborn, and I am your servant.
Alviarin Freidhen
He read it through again, blinking, then handed it to Moiraine. She barely scanned the page
before giving it to Egwene, who had her head over the other letter with Aviendha. Perhaps Moiraine
already knew what they contained?
“A good thing you gave your oath,” he said. “The way you used to be, keeping everything back, I
might have been ready to suspect you by now. A good thing you’re more open now.” She did not
react. “What do you make of it?”
“She must have heard about your swelled head,” Egwene said softly. He did not think he had
been meant to hear. Shaking her head, she said more loudly, “This doesn’t sound like Alviarin at all.”
“It is her hand,” Moiraine said. “What do you make of it, Rand?”
“I think there’s a rift in the Tower, whether Elaida knows it or not. I assume an Aes Sedai can’t
write a lie more easily than she can speak one?” He did not wait for her nod. “If Alviarin had been
less flowery, I might have thought they were working together to pull me in. I can’t see Elaida even
thinking half of what Alviarin wrote, and I can’t see her having a Keeper who could write it, not if
she knew.”
“You are not going to do this thing,” Aviendha said, Elaida’s letter crumpled in her hand. It was
not a question.
“I am not a fool.”
“Sometimes you are not,” she said grudgingly, and made it worse by raising a questioning
eyebrow to Egwene, who considered for a moment, then shrugged.
“Do you see anything else?” Moiraine asked.
“I see White Tower spies,” he told her dryly. “They know I hold the city.” For at least two or
three days after the battle, the Shaido would have stopped anything but a pigeon going north. Even a
rider who knew where to change horses, no sure thing between Cairhien and Tar Valon, could not
have reached the Tower in time for these letters to come back today.
Moiraine smiled. “You learn quickly. You will do well.” For a moment she almost looked fond.
“What will you do about it?”
“Nothing, except make sure that Elaida’s ‘escort’ doesn’t get within a mile of me.” Thirteen of
the weakest Aes Sedai could overwhelm him linked, and he did not think Elaida would send her
weakest. “That, and be aware that the Tower knows what I do the day after I do it. Nothing more until
I know more. Could Alviarin be one of your mysterious friends, Egwene?”
She hesitated, and he suddenly wondered whether she had told Moiraine any more than she had
him. Was it Aes Sedai secrets she kept, or Wise Ones’? At last she said simply, “I do not know.”
A rap came at the door, and Somara put her flaxen head into the room. “Matrim Cauthon has
come, Car’a’carn. He says that you sent for him.”
Four hours ago, as soon as he had learned Mat was back in the city. What would the excuse be
this time? It was time to be done with excuses. “Stay,” he told the women. Wise Ones made Mat
almost as uneasy as Aes Sedai did; these three would put him off balance. He did not give a second
thought to using them. He was going to use Mat, too. “Send him in, Somara.”
Mat strolled into the room grinning, as if it was a common room. His green coat hung open, and

his shirt was half unlaced, exposing the silver foxhead dangling on his sweaty chest, but the dark silk
scarf was draped around his neck to hide his hanging scar in spite of the heat. “Sorry if I took too
long. There were some Cairhienin who thought they knew how to play cards. Doesn’t he know
anything livelier?” he asked, jerking his head toward Asmodean.
“I hear,” Rand said, “that every young man who can pick up a sword wants to join the Band of
the Red Hand. Talmanes and Nalesean are having to turn them away in droves. And Daerid has
doubled the number of his footmen.”
Mat paused in lowering himself into the chair Aracome had used. “It’s true. A fine lot of young
. . . fellows wanting to be heroes.”
“The Band of the Red Hand,” Moiraine murmured. “Shen an Calhar. A legendary group of
heroes indeed, though the men in it must have changed many times in a war that lasted well over three
hundred years. It is said they were the last to fall to the Trollocs, guarding Aemon himself, when
Manetheren died. Legend says a spring rose where they fell, to mark their passing, but I rather think
the spring was already there.”
“I wouldn’t know about that.” Mat touched the foxhead medallion, and his voice picked up
strength. “Some fool got the name from somewhere, and they all started using it.”
Moiraine glanced at the medallion dismissively. The small blue stone hanging on the forehead
seemed to catch the light and glow, though the angles were wrong. “You are very brave, it seems,
Mat.” It was flatly said, and the silence that followed stiffened his face. “Very brave,” she said
finally, “to lead Shen an Calhar across the Alguenya and south against the Andorans. Even braver
than that, for there are rumors that you went alone to scout the way, and Talmanes and Nalesean had
to ride hard to catch up to you.” Egwene sniffed loudly in the background. “Hardly wise for a young
lord leading his men.”
Mat’s lip curled. “I’m no lord. I’ve more respect for myself than that.”
“But very brave,” Moiraine said as if he had not spoken. “Andoran supply wagons burned,
outposts destroyed. And three battles. Three battles, and three victories. With small loss to your own
men, though outnumbered.” As she fingered a rip in the shoulder of his coat, he sank back as far the
chair would allow. “Are you drawn to the thick of battles, or are they drawn to you? I am almost
surprised you came back. To hear the stories, you might have driven the Andorans back across the
Erinin had you stayed.”
“Do you think this is funny?” Mat snarled. “If you have something to say, say it. You can play the
cat all you want, but I’m no mouse.” For an instant his eyes flickered toward Egwene and Aviendha,
watching with folded arms, and he fingered the silver foxhead again. He had to be wondering. It had
stopped one woman’s channeling from touching him. Would it stop three?
Rand only watched. Watched his friend being softened for what he meant to do to him. Is there
anything left to me but necessity? It was a quick thought, there and gone. He would do what he must.
The Aes Sedai’s voice gained a rime of crystal frost as she spoke, almost in an echo. “We all do
as we must, as the Pattern decrees. For some there is less freedom than for others. It does not matter
whether we choose or are chosen. What must be, must be.”
Mat did not look softened at all. Wary, yes, and certainly angry, but not softened. He could have
been a tomcat backed into a corner by three hounds. A tomcat who meant to go down hard. He seemed
to have forgotten anyone was in the room except for himself and the three women. “You always have
to push a man where you want him, don’t you? Kick him there, if he won’t go led by the nose. Blood
and bloody ashes! Don’t glare at me, Egwene, I’ll speak the way I want. Burn me! All it needs is for
Nynaeve to be here, yanking her braid out of her head, and Elayne staring down her nose. Well, I’m

glad she isn’t, to hear the news, but even if you had Nynaeve, I’d not be shoved—”
“What news?” Rand said sharply. “News Elayne shouldn’t hear?”
Mat looked up at Moiraine. “You mean there’s something you haven’t ferreted out?”
“What news, Mat?” Rand demanded.
“Morgase is dead.”
Egwene gasped, clasping both hands to her mouth below eyes like huge circles. Moiraine
whispered something that might have been a prayer. Asmodean’s fingers never faltered on the harp.
Rand felt as if his belly had been ripped out. Elayne, forgive me. And a faint echo, altered.
Ilyena, forgive me. “Are you certain?”
“As certain as I can be without seeing the body. It seems Gaebril has been named King of Andor.
And Cairhien, too, for that matter. Supposedly Morgase did it. Something about the times needing a
strong man’s hand or some such, as if anybody could have a stronger than Morgase herself. Only,
those Andorans down south have heard rumors that she hasn’t been seen in weeks. More than rumors.
You tell me what it adds up to. Andor’s never had a king, but now it has one, and the queen’s
vanished. Gaebril’s the one wanted Elayne killed. I tried to tell her that, but you know how she
always knows more than a mudfooted farmer. I don’t think he’d balk a second at slitting a queen’s
throat.”
Rand discovered that he was sitting in one of the chairs across from Mat, though he did not
remember moving. Aviendha laid a hand on his shoulder. Concern tightened her eyes. “I am all right,”
he said roughly. “There’s no need to send for Somara.” Her face reddened, but he hardly noticed.
Elayne would never be able to forgive him. He had known that Rahvin—Gaebril—held Morgase
prisoner, but he had ignored it because the Forsaken might expect him to help her. He had gone his
own way, to do what they did not expect. And ended chasing Couladin instead of doing what he
planned. He had known, and concentrated his attention on Sammael. Because the man taunted him.
Morgase could wait while he smashed Sammael’s trap and Sammael with it. And so Morgase was
dead. Elayne’s mother was dead. Elayne would curse him to her deathbed.
“I’ll tell you one thing,” Mat was going on. “There are a lot of queen’s men down there. They
are not so sure about fighting for a king. You find Elayne. Half of them will flock to you to put her on
the—”
“Shut up!” Rand barked. He quivered so hard with fury that Egwene stepped back, and even
Moiraine eyed him carefully. Aviendha’s hand tightened on his shoulder, but he shook it off as he
stood. Morgase dead because he had done nothing. His own hand had been on the knife as surely as
Rahvin’s. Elayne. “She will be avenged. Rahvin, Mat. Not Gaebril. Rahvin. I’ll lay him by the heels
if I never do another thing!”
“Oh, blood and bloody ashes!” Mat groaned.
“This is madness.” Egwene flinched as if realizing what she had said, but she kept that firm,
calm voice. “You have your hands full with Cairhien yet, not to mention the Shaido to the north and
whatever it is you’re planning in Tear. Do you mean to start another war, with two on your plate
already and a ruined land besides?”
“Not a war. Me. I can be in Caemlyn in an hour. A raid—right, Mat?— a raid, not a war. I’ll rip
Rahvin’s heart out.” His voice was a hammer. He felt as if acid filled his veins. “I could wish I had
Elaida’s thirteen sisters to take with me, to smother him, and bring him to justice. Tried and hung for
murder. That would be justice. But he’ll just have to die however I can kill him.”
“Tomorrow,” Moiraine said softly.
Rand glared at her. But she was right. Tomorrow would be better. A night to let his rage cool.

He needed to be cold when he faced Rahvin. Now he wanted to seize saidin and lay about him,
destroying. Asmodean’s music had changed again, to a tune that street musicians in the city had played
during the civil war. You could still hear it sometimes when a Cairhienin noble passed. “The Fool
Who Thought He Was King.” “Get out, Natael. Get out!”
Asmodean straightened smoothly, bowing, but his face could have done for snow, and he
crossed the room quickly, as if uncertain what one second more might bring. He always pushed, but
perhaps this time he had pushed too far. As he opened the door, Rand spoke again.
“I will see you tonight. Or I will see you dead.”
Asmodean’s bow was not so graceful this time. “As my Lord Dragon commands,” he said
hoarsely, and hurriedly pulled the door shut with him on the other side.
The three women looked at Rand, expressionless, not blinking.
“The rest of you go, too.” Mat practically bounded toward the door. “Not you. I have things to
say to you yet.”
Mat stopped short, sighing loudly and fiddling with his medallion. He was the only one who had
moved.
“You do not have thirteen Aes Sedai,” Aviendha said, “but you have two. And myself. I may not
know as much as Moiraine Sedai, but I am as strong as Egwene, and I am no stranger to the dance.”
She meant the dance of spears, what the Aiel called battle.
“Rahvin is mine,” he told her quietly. Maybe Elayne could forgive him a little if he at least
avenged her mother. Probably not, but maybe he could forgive himself. A little. He forced his hands
to stay at his sides, to not make fists.
“Will you draw a line on the ground for him to step over?” Egwene asked. “Put a chip on your
shoulder? Have you considered that Rahvin might not be alone if he calls himself King of Andor
now? Much good it will do when you appear if one of his guards puts an arrow through your heart.”
He could remember wishing she would not shout at him, but it had been so much easier then.
“Did you think I meant to go alone?” He had; he had never thought of anyone to guard his back, though
now he could hear a small whisper, He likes to come from behind, or at your flanks. He could
hardly think clearly at all. His anger seemed to have a life of its own, stoking the fires that kept it
boiling. “But not you. This is dangerous. Moiraine can come if she wishes.”
Egwene and Aviendha did not look at one another before stepping forward, but they moved as
one, not stopping until they were so close even Aviendha had to tilt her head back to look up at him.
“Moiraine can come if she wishes,” Egwene said.
If her voice was smooth ice, Aviendha’s was molten stone. “But it is too dangerous for us.”
“Have you become my father? Is your name Bran al’Vere?”
“If you have three spears, do you put two aside because they are newer made?”
“I do not want to risk you,” he said stiffly.
Egwene arched her eyebrows. “Oh?” That was all.
“I am not gai’shain to you.” Aviendha bared her teeth. “You will never choose what risks I take,
Rand al’Thor. Never. Know it now.”
He could . . . What? Wrap them in saidin and leave them? He still could not shield them. So they
might well snare him in return. A fine mess, all because they wanted to be stubborn.
“You have thought of guards,” Moiraine said, “but what if who is with Rahvin is Semirhage, or
Graendal? Or Lanfear? These two might overwhelm one such, but could you face her and Rahvin
together alone?”
There had been something in her voice when she said Lanfear’s name. Was she afraid that if

Lanfear was there, he might finally join her? What would he do if she was there? What could he do?
“They can come,” he said through clenched teeth. “Now will you go?”
“As you command,” Moiraine said, but they were in no hurry about it. Aviendha and Egwene
took ostentatious care in rearranging their shawls before they started for the door. Lords and ladies
might dart at his word, but never them.
“You did not try to talk me out of it,” he said abruptly.
He meant it for Moiraine, but Egwene spoke first, though to Aviendha, and with a smile.
“Stopping a man from what he wants to do is like taking a sweet from a child. Sometimes you have to
do it, but sometimes it just isn’t worth the trouble.” Aviendha nodded.
“The Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills,” was Moiraine’s reply. She stood in the doorway
looking more Aes Sedai than he ever remembered her, ageless, with dark eyes that seemed ready to
swallow him, slight and slender yet so regal she could have commanded a roomful of queens if she
could not channel a spark. That blue stone on her forehead was catching the light again. “You will do
well, Rand.”
He stared at the door long after it closed behind them.
It was a scuff of boots that recalled him to Mat’s presence. Mat was trying to slide toward the
door, moving slowly so as not to be seen.
“I need to talk to you, Mat.”
Mat grimaced. Touching the foxhead like a talisman, he spun to face Rand. “If you think I’m
going to put my head on the block just because those fool women did, you can forget it now. I’m no
bloody hero, and I don’t want to be one. Morgase was a pretty woman—I even liked her; as much as
you can like a queen—but Rahvin is Rahvin, burn you, and I—”
“Shut up and listen. You have to stop running.”
“Burn me if I will! This is no game I chose, and I won’t—”
“I said, shut up!” Rand drove the foxhead against Mat’s chest with a hard finger. “I know where
you got this. I was there, remember? I cut the rope you were hanging from. I don’t know exactly what
got shoved into your head, but whatever it is, I need it. The clan chiefs know war, but somehow you
know it, too, and maybe better. I need that! So this is what you’re going to do, you and the Band of the
Red Hand. . . .”
“Be careful tomorrow,” Moiraine said.
Egwene paused at the door to her room. “Of course we’ll be careful.” Her stomach was turning
backflips, but she kept her voice steady. “We know how dangerous facing one of the Forsaken will
be.” By Aviendha’s expression, they might have been talking about what was for supper. But then, she
was never afraid of anything.
“Do you, now,” Moiraine murmured. “Be very careful anyway, whether you think one of the
Forsaken is near or not. Rand will need both of you in the days to come. You handle his temper well
—though I may say your methods are unusual. He will need people who cannot be driven away or
quelled by his rages, who will tell him what he must hear instead of what they think he wants to.”
“You do that, Moiraine,” Egwene told her.
“Of course. But he will still need you. Rest well. Tomorrow will be . . . difficult for us all.” She
glided away down the corridor, passing from dimness to pool of lamplight to dimness. Night was
already coming to these shadowed halls, and oil was in short supply.
“Will you stay with me awhile, Aviendha?” Egwene asked. “I feel more like talking than
eating.”

“I must tell Amys what I have promised to do tomorrow. And I must be in Rand al’Thor’s
sleeping chamber when he comes.”
“Elayne can never complain that you haven’t watched Rand closely for her. Did you really drag
the Lady Berewin down the hall by her hair?”
Aviendha’s cheeks colored faintly. “Do you think these Aes Sedai in—Salidar?—will help
him?”
“Be careful of that name, Aviendha. Rand cannot be allowed to find them without preparation.”
The way he was now, they would be more likely to gentle him, or at least send thirteen sisters of their
own, than help him. She would have to stand between them in Tel’aran’rhiod, she and Nynaeve and
Elayne, and hope those Aes Sedai had committed themselves too far to back out before they
discovered how near the brink he was.
“I will be careful. Rest well. And eat well tonight. In the morning, eat nothing. It is not good to
dance the spears with a full stomach.”
Egwene watched her stride away before pressing her hands to her stomach. She did not think she
would eat tonight or in the morning. Rahvin. And maybe Lanfear, or one of the others. Nynaeve had
faced Moghedien and won. But Nynaeve was stronger than she or Aviendha, when she could channel
at all. There might not be another. Rand said the Forsaken did not trust one another. She could almost
wish he was wrong, or at least that he was not so certain. It was frightening when she thought she saw
another man looking through his eyes, heard another man’s words come out of his mouth. It should not
be so; everyone was reborn as the Wheel turned. But everyone was not the Dragon Reborn. Moiraine
would not talk of it. What would Rand do if Lanfear was there? Lanfear had loved Lews Therin
Telamon, but what had the Dragon felt for her? How much of Rand was still Rand?
“You will work yourself into a tizzy this way,” she said firmly. “You’re not a child. Act like a
woman.”
When a serving woman brought her supper of snapbeans and potatoes and fresh baked bread, she
made herself eat. It tasted like ashes.
Mat strode through the dimly lit corridors of the palace and flung open the door of the rooms that
had been set aside for the young hero of the battle against the Shaido. Not that he had spent much time
there; hardly any. Servants had lit two of the stand-lamps. Hero! He was no hero! What did a hero
get? An Aes Sedai patting you on the head before she sent you out like a hound to do it again. A
noblewoman condescending to favor you with a kiss, or laying a flower on your grave. He stalked
back and forth in his anteroom, for once not pricing the flowered Illianer carpet or the chairs and
chests and tables gilded and inlaid with ivory.
The stormy meeting with Rand had gone on till the sun set, him dodging, refusing, Rand
following as doggedly as Hawkwing after the rout at Cole Pass. What was he to do? If he rode out
again, Talmanes and Nalesean would surely follow with as many men as they could put in the saddle,
expecting him to find another battle. And he probably would; that was what really put a chill on it.
Much as he hated to admit it, the Aes Sedai was right. He was drawn to battle or it to him. Nobody
could have tried harder to avoid one on the other side of the Alguenya. Even Talmanes had
commented on it. Until the second time his careful creeping away from one lot of Andorans took them
where there was no choice but to fight another. And every time he could feel the dice rolling in his
head; it was almost like a warning that a fight was just over the next hill, now.
There was always a ship, or might be, down at the docks beside the grain barges. Hard to find
yourself in a battle on a ship in the middle of a river. Except the Andorans held one bank of the

Alguenya for half its length or more below the city. The way his luck was running, the ship would run
aground on the west bank with half the Andoran army camped there.
That left doing what Rand wanted. He could just see it.
“Good morrow, High Lord Weiramon, and all you other High Lords and Ladies. I’m a gambler,
a farmboy, and I’m here to take command of your bloody army! The bloody lord Dragon Reborn will
be with us as soon as he flaming takes care of one bloody little matter!”
Snatching his black-hafted spear from the corner, he hurled it the length of the room. It struck a
wall hanging—a hunting scene—and the stone wall behind with a loud clang, then dropped to the
floor, leaving the hunters neatly sliced in two. Swearing, he hurried to pick it up. The two-foot
sword-blade was not chipped or marred. Of course not. Aes Sedai work.
He fingered the ravens on the blade. “Will I ever be free of Aes Sedai work?”
“What was that?” Melindhra asked from the door.
He eyed her as he propped the spear against the wall, and for a change it was not spun-gold hair
or clear blue eyes or a firm body that he thought of. It seemed that every Aiel went to the river sooner
or later, to stare silently at so much water in one place, but Melindhra went every day, just about.
“Has Kadere found ships yet?” Kadere would not be going to Tar Valon on grain barges.
“The peddler’s wagons are still there. I do not know about . . . ships.” She pronounced the
unfamiliar word awkwardly. “Why do you wish to know?”
“I’m going away for a while. For Rand,” he added hastily. Her face was too still. “I’d take you
with me if I could, but you wouldn’t want to leave the Maidens.” A ship, or his own horse? And to
where? That was the question. He could reach Tear quicker on a fast rivership than on Pips. If he was
fool enough to make that choice. If he had any choice.
Melindhra’s mouth tightened briefly. To his surprise, it was not over his leaving her. “So you
slip back into Rand al’Thor’s shadow. You have gained much honor of your own, among the Aiel as
well as the wetlanders. Your honor, not honor reflected from the Car’a’carn.”
“He can keep his honor and take it to Caemlyn or the Pit of Doom for all I care. Don’t you
worry. I’ll find plenty of honor. I will write you about it. From Tear.” Tear? He would never escape
Rand, or Aes Sedai, if he made that choice.
“He is going to Caemlyn?”
Mat suppressed a wince. He was not supposed to say anything about that. Whatever he decided
about the rest, he could do that much. “Just a name pulled from my pocket. Because of the Andorans
down south, I suppose. I wouldn’t know where he’s—”
He had no warning. One instant she was just standing there, the next her foot was in his middle,
driving out breath, doubling him over. Eyes bulging, he fought to keep his feet, to straighten, to think.
Why? She spun like a dancer, backwards, and her other foot against the side of his head drove him
staggering. Without a pause she leaped straight up, kicking out, her soft bootsole taking him hard flush
in the face.
When his eyes cleared enough to see, he was on his back, halfway across the room from her. He
could feel blood on his face. His head seemed stuffed with wool, and the room seemed to rock. That
was when he saw her take a knife from her pouch, slim blade not much longer than her hand, gleaming
in the lamplight. Winding the shoufa around her head in a quick motion, she raised the black veil
across her face.
Groggily, he moved by instinct, without thinking. The blade came out of his sleeve, left his hand
as if floating through jelly. Only then did he realize what he had done and stretch out desperately,
trying to snatch it back.

The hilt bloomed between her breasts. She sagged to her knees, fell back.
Mat pushed himself up, wavering on hands and knees. He could not have stood if his life hung on
it, but he crawled to her, muttering wildly. “Why? Why?”
He jerked her veil aside, and those clear blue eyes focused on him. She even smiled. He did not
look at the knife-hilt. His knife-hilt. He knew where the heart was in a body. “Why, Melindhra?”
“I always liked your pretty eyes,” she breathed, so faint he had to strain to hear.
“Why?”
“Some oaths are more important than others, Mat Cauthon.” The slim-bladed knife came up
swiftly, all her remaining strength behind it, the point driving the dangling foxhead against his chest.
The silver medallion should not have stopped a blade, but the angle was just that much wrong, and
some hidden flaw in the steel snapped the blade off right at the hilt just as he caught her hand. “You
have the Great Lord’s own luck.”
“Why?” he demanded. “Burn you, why?” He knew there would be no answer. Her mouth
remained open, as though she might say something more, but her eyes were already beginning to glaze.
He started to pull the veil back up, to cover her face and staring eyes, then let his hand fall. He
had killed men, and Trollocs, but never a woman. Never a woman until now. Women were glad when
he came into their lives. It was not boasting. Women smiled for him; even when he left them, they
smiled as if they would welcome him back. That was all he ever really wanted from women; a smile,
a dance, a kiss, and to be remembered fondly.
He realized his thoughts were babbling. Jerking the bladeless hilt from Melindhra’s hand—it
was gold-mounted jade, inlaid with golden bees—he hurled it into the marble fireplace, hoping it
shattered. He wanted to cry, to howl. I don’t kill women! I kiss them, I don’t . . . !
He had to think clearly. Why? Not because he was leaving, surely. She had hardly reacted to
that. Besides, she thought he was chasing off after honor; she had always approved of that. Something
she had said tugged at him, and then came back, with a chill. The Great Lord’s own luck. He had
heard it differently, many times. The Dark One’s own luck. “A Darkfriend.” A question, or certainty?
He wished the thought made what he had done easier in his mind. He was going to carry her face to
his grave.
Tear. He had as much as told her he was going to Tear. The dagger. Golden bees in jade. He
would wager there were nine without looking. Nine golden bees on a field of green. The sign of
Illian. Where Sammael ruled. Could Sammael be afraid of him? How could Sammael even know? It
was only a few hours since Rand had asked Mat—told him—and he was not sure himself what he
was going to do. Maybe Sammael would not take the chance? Right. One of the Forsaken, afraid of a
gambler, however stuffed with other men’s battle knowledge his head might be. That was ridiculous.
It all came down to this. He could believe that Melindhra had not been a Darkfriend, that she had
decided to kill him on a whim, that there was no connection between a jade hilt inlaid with golden
bees and his maybe going to Tear to lead an army against Illian. He could if he was a bullgoose fool.
Better to err toward caution, he always said. One of the Forsaken had noticed him. He certainly was
not standing in Rand’s shadow now.
Sliding across the floor, he sat with his chin on his knees and his back against the door, staring at
Melindhra’s face, trying to decide what to do. When a servant knocked with his supper, he shouted
for her to go away. Food was the last thing he wanted. What was he going to do? He wished he did
not feel the dice spinning in his head.

CHAPTER

Choices

Laying down his razor, Rand wiped the last flecks of lather from his face and began doing up
his shirtlaces. Early morning sunlight streamed through the square arches leading to his bedchamber
balcony; the heavy winter curtains had been hung, but tied back to let in a breath of air. He would be
presentable when he killed Rahvin. The thought loosed a bubble of rage, floating up out of his belly.
He forced it back down. He would be presentable, and calm. Cold. No mistakes.
When he turned from the gilt-framed mirror, Aviendha was sitting on her rolled-up pallet against
the wall, beneath a hanging portraying impossibly high gold towers. He had offered to have another
bed put in the room, but she claimed mattresses were too soft for sleeping. She was watching him
intently, her shift forgotten in one hand. He had been careful about not looking around from his
shaving to give her time to dress, but aside from her white stockings, she wore not a stitch.
“I would not shame you in front of other men,” she said abruptly.
“Shame me? What do you mean?”
She stood in one smooth motion, surprisingly pale where the sun had not touched her, slender
and hard-muscled, yet with roundnesses and softnesses that haunted his dreams. This was the first
time he had allowed himself to look at her openly when she flaunted herself, but she did not seem
aware of it. Those big blue-green eyes were fixed on his. “I did not ask Sulin to include Enaila or
Somara or Lamelle that first day. Nor did I ask them to watch you, or to do anything if you faltered.
That was only their own concern.”
“You just let me think they would try to carry me off like a babe if I wavered. A fine
distinction.”
His wry tone flew right past her. “It made you take care when you needed to.”
“I see,” he said dryly. “Well, I thank you for the promise not to shame me, in any case.”
She smiled. “I did not say that, Rand al’Thor. I said not in front of other men. If you require it,
for your own good. . . .” Her smile deepened.
“Do you mean to come like that?” He gestured irritably, taking her in from head to toe.
She had never shown the slightest embarrassment at being naked in front of him—far from it—
but she glanced down at herself, then at him looking at her, and her face reddened. Suddenly she was
surrounded by a flurry of dark brown wool and white algode, flying into her clothes so quickly that he
could have thought she was channeling them on. “Have you arranged everything?” came from the
middle of it. “Have you spoken to the Wise Ones? You were gone late last night. Who else comes
with us? How many can you take? No wetlanders, I hope. You cannot trust them. Especially not
treekillers. Can you truly carry us to Caemlyn in one hour? Is it like what I did the night . . . ? I mean
to say, how will you do it? I cannot like trusting myself to things I do not know and cannot

understand.”
“Everything is arranged, Aviendha.” Why was she babbling? And refusing to meet his eye? He
had met with Rhuarc and the other chiefs still near the city; they had not truly liked his plan, but they
saw it in terms of ji’e’toh, and none thought he had any other choice. They discussed it quickly,
agreed, and then turned the talk to other things. Nothing to do with Forsaken or Illian or battle at all.
Women, hunting, whether Cairhienin brandy could compare with oosquai, or wetlander tabac with
what was grown in the Waste. For an hour he had almost forgotten what lay ahead. He hoped that the
Prophecy of Rhuidean was somehow wrong, that he would not destroy those men. The Wise Ones had
come to him, a delegation of more than fifty, alerted by Aviendha herself and led by Amys and
Melaine and Bair; or maybe by Sorilea. With Wise Ones often it was difficult to tell who was in
charge. They had not come to talk him out of anything—ji’e’toh again—but to make sure he
understood that his obligation to Elayne did not outweigh that to the Aiel, and they had kept him in the
meeting room until they were satisfied. It was that or lift them bodily out of his way to reach the door.
When they wanted to be, those women were as good at ignoring shouts as Egwene had become.
“We’ll find out how many I can take when I try. Only Aiel.” With luck, Meilan and Maringil and the
rest would not know he was gone until after he went. If the Tower had spies in Cairhien, maybe the
Forsaken did as well, and how could he trust people to keep secrets who could not see the sun rise
without trying to use the fact in Daes Dae’mar?
By the time he had shrugged into a red coat embroidered in gold, a fine wool eminently suitable
for a Royal Palace, in Caemlyn or Cairhien—the thought amused him, in a bleak sort of way—by that
time, Aviendha was almost dressed. It was a wonder to him how she could scramble into her clothes
so quickly and yet have nothing out of place. “A woman came last night while you were away.”
Light! He had forgotten Colavaere. “What did you do?”
She paused in tying the laces of her blouse, eyes trying to bore a hole in his head, but her tone
was offhand. “I took her back to her own chambers, where we talked for a time. There will be no
more treekiller flipskirts scratching at your tent flap, Rand al’Thor.”
“The very end I aimed at, Aviendha. Light! Did you hurt her badly? You can’t go around beating
ladies. These people cause me enough trouble without you bringing more.”
She sniffed loudly and went back to her laces. “Ladies! A woman is a woman, Rand al’Thor.
Unless she is a Wise One,” she added judiciously. “That one sits lightly this morning, but her bruises
can be hidden, and with a day’s rest she will be able to leave her chambers. And she knows the right
of matters, now. I told her if she caused you any bother again—any bother—I would come talk to her
once more. A much longer talk. She will do as you say, when you say it. Her example will teach
others. The treekillers understand nothing else.”
Rand sighed. Not a method he would or could have chosen, but it might actually work. Or it
might only make Colavaere and the others more sly from now on. Aviendha might not be worried
about repercussions against herself—in fact, he would be surprised if she had even considered the
possibility—but a woman who was High Seat of a powerful House was not the same as a young
noblewoman of lesser rank. Whatever the effect for him, Aviendha could find herself set upon in
some dark hallway and given ten times what she had given Colavaere, if not worse. “Next time, let
me handle matters my way. I am the Car’a’carn, remember.”
“You have shaving lather on your ear, Rand al’Thor.”
Muttering to himself, he snatched up the striped towel and shouted, “Come!” to a rap at the door.
Asmodean entered, pale lace at the neck and cuffs of his black coat, harpcase slung on his back
and a sword at his hip. It might have been winter for the coolness of his face, but his dark eyes were

wary.
“What do you want, Natael?” Rand demanded. “I gave you your instructions last night.”
Asmodean wet his lips and glanced once at Aviendha, who was frowning at him. “Wise
instructions. I suppose I might learn something to your advantage, remaining here and watching, but
the talk this morning is all of the shrieks from Lady Colavaere’s apartments last night. It is said she
displeased you, though no one seems to know quite how. That uncertainty is making everyone step
lightly. I doubt anyone will breathe in the next few days without considering what you might make of
it.” Aviendha’s face was a picture of insufferable self-satisfaction.
“So you want to come with me?” Rand said softly. “You want to be at my back when I face
Rahvin?”
“What better place for the Lord Dragon’s bard? But better yet, say under your eye. Where I can
show my loyalty. I am not strong.” Asmodean’s grimace seemed natural enough in any man making
that admission, but for an instant Rand sensed saidin filling the other man, felt the taint that twisted
Asmodean’s mouth. Just for an instant, but long enough for him to judge. If Asmodean had drawn as
much as he could, he would be hard pressed to match one of the Wise Ones who could channel. “Not
strong, yet perhaps I can help in some small way.”
Rand wished he could see the shield Lanfear had woven. She had said it would dissipate with
time, but Asmodean did not seem able to channel any more strongly now than he had the first day he
was in Rand’s hands. Perhaps she had lied, to give Asmodean false hope, to make Rand believe the
man would grow strong enough to teach him more than he ever would. It would be like her. He was
uncertain whether that was his thought or Lews Therin’s, but he was sure it was true.
The long pause made Asmodean lick his lips again. “A day or two will not matter here. You will
be back by then, or dead. Let me prove my loyalty. Perhaps I can do something. A whisker more
weight on your side might shift the balance.” Once more saidin poured into him, just for a moment.
Rand felt a sensation of strain, yet it was still a feeble flow. “You know my choices. I am clinging to
that tuft of grass on the cliff’s lip, praying for it to hold one more heartbeat. If you fail, I am worse
than dead. I must see you win and live.” Suddenly eyeing Aviendha, he seemed to realize he might
have said too much. His laugh was a hollow sound. “Else how can I compose the songs of the Lord
Dragon’s glory? A bard must have something to work with.” The heat never touched Asmodean—a
trick of the mind, he claimed, not the Power—but beads of sweat oozed down his forehead now.
Under his eyes, or left behind? Perhaps to run looking for a hiding place when he began
wondering what was happening in Caemlyn. Asmodean would be the man he was until he died and
was reborn, and perhaps even after. “Under my eyes,” Rand said quietly. “And if I even suspect that
where that whisker falls might displease me . . .”
“I put my trust in the Lord Dragon’s mercy,” Asmodean murmured, bowing. “With the Lord
Dragon’s permission, I will wait outside.”
Rand glanced around the room as the man departed, backing away still half-bowed. His sword
lay on the gilt-lined chest at the foot of the bed, Dragon-buckled sword belt wrapped around the
scabbard and the Seanchan spearhead. The killing today would not be with steel, not on his part. He
touched his pocket, felt the hard carved shape of the fat little man with his sword; that was the only
sword he needed today. For a moment, he considered Skimming to Tear, to take back Callandor, or
even to Rhuidean for what was hidden there. He could destroy Rahvin with either before the man
knew he was there. He could destroy Caemlyn itself with either. But could he trust himself? So much
power. So much of the One Power. Saidin hung there just out of sight. The taint seemed part of him.
Rage oozed just beneath the surface, at Rahvin, at himself. If it broke loose, and he held even

Callandor . . . What would he do? He would be invincible. With the other, he could Skim to Shayol
Ghul itself, put an end to it all, end it now one way or another. One way or another. No. He was not in
this alone. He could not afford anything but victory.
“The world rides on my shoulders,” he murmured. Suddenly he yelped and clapped a hand to his
left buttock. It felt as though a needle had stabbed him, but he did not need the goose bumps fading on
his arms to tell him what had happened. “What was that for?” he growled at Aviendha.
“Just to see whether the Lord Dragon was still made of flesh like the rest of us mortals.”
“I am,” he said flatly, and seized saidin— all the sweetness; all the filth—just long enough to
channel briefly.
Her eyes widened, but she did not flinch, only looked at him as if nothing had occurred at all.
Still, as they crossed the anteroom, she rubbed furtively at her bottom when she thought he was
looking the other way. It seemed she was ordinary flesh, too. Burn me, I thought I’d taught her a few
manners.
Pulling open the door, he stepped out and stood staring. Mat was leaning on his odd spear with
that broad-brimmed hat pulled low, a little apart from Asmodean, but that was not took him aback.
There were no Maidens. He should have known something was wrong when Asmodean came in
unannounced. Aviendha was looking around in amazement, as if she expected to find them behind one
of the tapestries.
“Melindhra tried to kill me last night,” Mat said, and Rand stopped thinking about Maidens.
“One minute we were talking, the next she was trying to kick my head off.”
Mat told the story in short sentences. The dagger with the golden bees. His conclusions. He
closed his eyes when he told how he had ended it—a simple, stark, “I killed her”— and opened them
again quickly as if he saw something behind his eyelids he did not care to see.
“I’m sorry you had to do that,” Rand said quietly, and Mat gave a bleak shrug.
“Better her than me. I suppose. She was a Darkfriend.” He did not sound as if it made much
difference.
“I will settle Sammael. Just as soon as I’m ready.”
“And how many will that leave?”
“The Forsaken are not here,” Aviendha snapped. “And neither are the Maidens of the Spear.
Where are they? What have you done, Rand al’Thor?”
“Me? There were twenty right here when I came to bed last night, and I haven’t seen one since.”
“Perhaps it is because Mat . . .” Asmodean began, and stopped when Mat looked at him, a tightmouthed blend of pain and readiness to hit something.
“Do not be fools,” Aviendha said in a firm voice. “Far Dareis Mai would not claim toh against
Mat Cauthon for this. She tried to kill him, and he killed her. Even her near-sisters would not, if she
had had any. And no one would claim toh against Rand al’Thor for what another did unless he
ordered it done. You have done something, Rand al’Thor, something great and dark, or they would be
here.”
“I’ve done nothing,” he told her sharply. “And I don’t intend to stand here discussing it. Are you
dressed for the ride south, Mat?”
Mat shoved a hand into his coatpocket, fingering something. He usually kept his dice and
dicecup in there. “Caemlyn. I’m tired of them sneaking up on me. I want to sneak up on one of them
for a change. I just hope I get the bloody pat on the head instead of the bloody flower,” he added with
a grimace.
Rand did not ask him what he meant. Another ta’veren. Two together to twist chance perhaps.

No way to tell how, or even if, but . . . “It seems like we’ll be together a little longer.” Mat looked
more resigned than anything else.
Before they had gone far down the tapestry-lined corridor, Moiraine and Egwene met them,
gliding along together as if the day held no more ahead than a walk in one of the gardens. Egwene,
cool-eyed and calm, golden Great Serpent on her finger, really could have been Aes Sedai despite
her Aiel clothes and shawl and the folded scarf around her temples, while Moiraine . . . Gold threads
caught the light, faintly streaking Moiraine’s gown of shimmering blue silk. The small blue stone on
her forehead, hanging from its gold chain fastened in her waves of dark hair, shone as brightly as the
large gold-set sapphires around her neck. Hardly suitable garb for what they intended, yet in his red
coat, Rand could not comment.
Perhaps it was being here, where House Damodred had once held the Sun Throne, but
Moiraine’s graceful carriage was more regal than he remembered ever seeing it. Not even the
presence of “Jasin Natael” could spoil that queenly serenity with surprise, but amazingly, she gave
Mat a warm smile. “So you are going, too, Mat. Learn to trust the Pattern. Do not waste your life
attempting to change what cannot be changed.” From Mat’s face, he might have been considering
changing his mind about being there at all, but the Aes Sedai turned from him without a trace of
worry. “These are for you, Rand.”
“More letters?” he said. One bore his name in an elegant hand that he recognized immediately.
“From you, Moiraine?” The other carried Thom Merrilin’s name. Both had been sealed with blue
wax, apparently with her Great Serpent ring, impressed with the image of the snake biting its own
tail. “Why write me a letter? And sealed. You’ve never been afraid to say whatever you wanted to
say to my face. If I ever forgot it, Aviendha has been reminding me that I’m only flesh and blood.”
“You have changed from the boy I first saw outside the Winespring Inn.” Her voice was a soft
silver chiming. “You are hardly the same at all. I pray you have changed enough.”
Egwene murmured something low. Rand thought it was, “I pray you have not changed too much.”
She was frowning at the letters as if she, too, wondered what was in them. So was Aviendha.
Moiraine went on more brightly, even briskly. “Seals ensure privacy. That contains things I wish
you to think on; not now; when you have time for thinking. As for Thom’s letter, I know no safer hands
than yours in which to place it. Give it to him when you see him again. Now, there is something you
must see at the docks.”
“The docks?” Rand said. “Moiraine, this morning of all mornings, I’ve no time for—”
But she was already moving down the corridor as if sure he would follow. “I have had horses
readied. Even one for you, Mat, just in case.” Egwene hesitated only a moment, then followed.
Rand opened his mouth to call Moiraine back. She had sworn to obey. Whatever she had to
show him, he could see it another day.
“What could an hour hurt?” Mat muttered. Perhaps he was reconsidering.
“It would not be amiss for you to be seen this morning,” Asmodean said. “Rahvin might just
know of it as soon as it happens. If he has any suspicions—if he has any spies who may have listened
at keyholes—it might allay them for today.”
Rand looked at Aviendha. “Do you also counsel delay?”
“I counsel that you listen to Moiraine Sedai. Only fools ignore Aes Sedai.”
“What could be at the docks more important than Rahvin?” he growled, then shook his head.
There was a saying in the Two Rivers, not that anybody said it where women could hear. “The
Creator made women to please the eye and trouble the mind.” Aes Sedai were certainly no different
in one respect. “One hour.”

The sun was not yet high enough to lift the city wall’s long shadow from the stone quay where
Kadere’s wagons were lined up, but he still mopped his face with a large handkerchief. It was only
partly the heat that made him sweat. Great gray curtain walls stretching into the river at either end of
the row of docks made the quay seem a dim box, with him caught in it. There were nothing but broad,
round-bowed grain barges docked here, and the same anchored in the river waiting their turn to
unload. He had considered slipping onto one when it cast off, but it meant abandoning most of what he
still possessed. Yet had he thought the slow passage downriver would take him anywhere except to
his death, he would have. Lanfear had not returned to his dreams, but he had the burns on his chest to
remind him of her commands. Just the thought of disobeying one of the Chosen made him shiver, even
with sweat rolling down his face.
If only he knew who to trust; to the extent it was possible to trust any of his fellow Darkfriends.
The last of his drivers who had sworn the oaths had vanished two days ago, very likely on one of the
grain barges. He still did not know which Aiel woman had slipped that note under his wagon door
—“You are not alone among strangers. A way has been chosen”— though he had several possibilities
in mind. The docks held almost as many Aiel as they did workmen, come to stare at the river; he had
seen a few of those faces more often than seemed reasonable, and some had looked at him
consideringly. A few Cairhienin had as well, and a Tairen lord. That meant nothing by itself, of
course, but if he could find a few men to work with . . .
A mounted party appeared in one of the gateways, Moiraine and Rand al’Thor leading the way
with the Aes Sedai’s Warder as they threaded though the carts hauling grainsacks away. A wave of
cheers rode with them.
“All glory to the Lord Dragon!” and “Hail the Lord Dragon!” and now and again “Glory to Lord
Matrim! Glory to the Red Hand!”
For once the Aes Sedai turned down toward the tail end of the line of wagons without so much
as a glance at Kadere. He was just as glad. Even if she had not been Aes Sedai, even if she had not
looked at him as if she knew every black corner of his mind, he would as soon not have looked too
closely at some of the things she had filled his wagons with. Yesterday evening she had made him
strip the canvas off that oddly twisted redstone doorframe in the wagon just behind his. She seemed to
take a perverse delight in making him help her himself with whatever she wanted to study. He would
have covered the thing up again if he could bear to go near it, or could make any of his drivers do so.
None with him now had seen Herid fall half through it in Rhuidean and half disappear—Herid had
been the first to run away once they cleared the Jangai; the man had not been entirely right in the head
after the Warder hauled him back—but they could look at it, see the way the corners did not meet
properly, how you could not follow it around with your eyes without blinking and growing dizzy.
Kadere ignored the first three riders as much as the Aes Sedai had ignored him, and Mat Cauthon
almost as much. The man was wearing his hat; he had never been able to find a replacement. The Aiel
wench, Aviendha, rode up behind the young Aes Sedai’s saddle, both with their skirts pushed up to
show their legs. If he needed any confirmation that the Aiel woman was bedding al’Thor, he only had
to see the way she looked at him; a woman who had taken a man to her bed always looked at him with
that light of ownership in her eyes after. More importantly, Natael was with them. This was the first
time Kadere had been this close to him since crossing the Spine of the Wall. Natael, who stood high
in the Darkfriends. If he could get past the Maidens to reach Natael . . .
Suddenly Kadere blinked. Where were the Maidens? Al’Thor always had an escort of spearwielding women. Frowning, he realized he could not see a single Maiden among the Aiel on the quay

or the docks.
“Aren’t you going to look at an old friend, Hadnan?”
That melodious voice jerked Kadere around, gaping at a hatchet-nosed face, dark eyes almost
hidden by rolls of fat. “Keille?” It was impossible. No one survived alone in the Waste except Aiel.
She had to be dead. But there she stood, white silk straining over her bulk, ivory combs standing tall
in her dark curls.
A faint smile on her lips, she turned with a grace that still surprised him in a woman so large and
lightly climbed the steps into his wagon.
For a moment he hesitated, then hurried after her. He would as soon Keille Shaogi really had
died in the Waste—the woman was bossy and obnoxious; she need not think she was getting a penny
of the little he had managed to salvage—but she stood as high as Jasin Natael. Perhaps she would
answer a few questions. At the least, he would have someone to work with. At the worst, someone to
put blame on. Power went with standing high, but so did blame for the failures of those beneath you.
More than once he had fed his superiors to those still higher up in order to cover himself.
Carefully closing the door, he turned—and would have screamed if his throat had not clenched
too tight for sound.
The woman who stood there wore white silk, but she was not fat. She was the most beautiful
woman he had ever seen, eyes like dark, bottomless mountain pools, woven silver belting her narrow
waist, silver crescents in her shimmering black hair. Kadere knew that face from his dreams.
His knees thudding to the floor shook breath loose. “Great Mistress,” he said hoarsely, “how
may I serve?”
Lanfear might have been looking at an insect, one she might crush beneath her slipper or might
not. “By showing your obedience to my commands. I have been too busy to watch Rand al’Thor
myself. Tell me what he has done, aside from conquering Cairhien, what he plans to do.”
“It is difficult, Great Mistress. One such as myself cannot come close to such as he.” An insect,
those cool eyes said, allowed to live so long as it was useful. Kadere racked his brain for everything
he had seen or heard or imagined. “He is sending Aiel south in huge numbers, Great Mistress, though
I do not know why. The Tairens and Cairhienin do not seem to notice, but I don’t think they can tell
one Aiel from another.” Neither could he. He would not dare lie to her, but if she thought he had more
use than he did . . . “He has founded a school of some sort, in a city palace that belonged to a House
with no survivors. . . .” At first there was no way to tell whether she liked what she was hearing, but
as he went on, her face began to darken.
“What is it you want me to see, Moiraine?” Rand said impatiently, tying Jeade’en’s reins to one
wheel of the last wagon in line.
She was standing on tiptoe to peer over the side of the wagon bed at a pair of casks that seemed
familiar. Unless he was mistaken, they held the two cuendillar seals, packed in wool for protection
now that they were no longer unbreakable. He felt the Dark One’s taint strongly here; it almost
seemed to come from the casks, a faint miasma as from something rotting in a hidden place.
“It will be safe here,” Moiraine murmured. Lifting her skirts gracefully, she started up the line of
wagons. Lan heeled her, a half-tame wolf, the cloak hanging down his back all disturbing ripples of
color and nothingness.
Rand glared. “Did she tell you what it was, Egwene?”
“Just that you had to see something. That you had to come here, anyway.”
“You must trust Aes Sedai,” Aviendha said, almost as levelly, but with a hint of doubt. Mat

snorted.
“Well, I mean to find out now. Natael, go tell Bael I’ll be with him in—”
At the other end of the line, the side of Kadere’s wagon exploded, splinters scything down Aiel
and townsfolk. Rand knew; he did not need goose bumps prickling his skin to know. He raced toward
the wagon, after Moiraine and Lan. Time seemed to slow, everything happening at once, as if the air
were jelly clinging to each moment.
Lanfear stepped out into stunned silence except for the moans and screams of the injured,
something limp and pale and red-streaked hanging from her hand, dragging behind her as she walked
down invisible steps. Her face was a mask carved of ice. “He told me, Lews Therin,” she almost
screamed, flinging the pale thing into the air. Something caught it, inflated it for a moment into a
bloody, transparent statue of Hadnan Kadere; his skin, removed whole. The figure collapsed and fell
as Lanfear’s voice rose to a screech. “You let another woman touch you! Again!”
Moments clinging, all happening at once.
Before Lanfear reached the stones of the quay, Moiraine lifted her skirts higher and began
running straight toward her. Quick as she was, Lan was quicker, ignoring her shout of, “No, Lan!”
Sword coming out, long legs carried him ahead of her, color-shifting cloak waving behind as he
charged. Suddenly he seemed to run into an invisible stone wall, bounce back, try to stagger forward
again. One step, and as if a giant hand had smashed him aside, he flew ten paces through the air,
crashing to the stones.
While he was in midair, Moiraine jerked forward, feet skidding along the pavement, until she
was face to face with Lanfear. It was only for a moment. The Forsaken looked at her as though
wondering what could have gotten in her way, then Moiraine was flung to one side so hard she rolled
over and over until she disappeared beneath one of the wagons.
The quayside was in turmoil. Just moments since Kadere’s wagon erupted, yet only the blind
could not know the One Power was being wielded by the woman in white. Along the docks axes
flashed, cutting ropes, freeing barges as their crews desperately fended the craft toward open water
and flight. Bare-chested dockmen and dark-clothed townsfolk struggled to jump aboard. In the other
direction men and women milled and screamed as they fought to pass through the gates into the city.
And among them, cadin’sor-clad figures veiled themselves and rushed at Lanfear with spears or
knives or bare hands. There could be no doubt she was the source of the attack, no doubt she fought
with the Power. They ran to dance the spears regardless.
Fire rolled over them in waves. Arrows of it pierced those who came on with their clothes in
flames. It was not as if Lanfear battled them, or even paid them any real mind. She might have been
brushing aside gnats or bitemes. Those who fled burned as well as those who tried to fight. She
moved toward Rand as if nothing else existed.
Heartbeats only.
Three steps she had taken when Rand seized the male half of the True Source, molten steel and
steel-shattering ice, sweet honey and midden heap. Deep in the Void, the fight for survival was
distant, the battle before him scarely less. As Moiraine vanished beneath the wagon, he channeled,
pulling the heat from Lanfear’s fires, sinking it into the river. Flames that a moment before engulfed
human forms, vanished. In the same instant he wove the flows again, and a misty gray dome came into
being, a long oval enclosing him and Lanfear and most of the wagons, an almost transparent wall that
shut out all not already within. Even as he tied the weave, he was not sure what it was or where it had
come from—some memory of Lews Therin’s perhaps—but Lanfear’s fires struck it and stopped. He
could see people outside dimly, too many thrashing and flailing—he had taken the flames, not the

searing of flesh; that stench still hung in the air—but none would burn now that had not already.
Bodies lay inside, too, mounds of charred cloth, some stirring feebly, moaning. She did not care; her
channeled flames winked out; the gnats were dispelled; she never glanced aside.
Heartbeats. He was cold in the emptiness of the Void, and if he felt sorrow for the dead and
dying and scarred, the feeling was so far off it might not have been. He was cold itself. Emptiness
itself. Only the rage of saidin filled him.
Movement to either side. Aviendha and Egwene, eyes concentrated on Lanfear. He had meant to
shut them out from this. They must have raced with him. Mat and Asmodean; outside; the wall missed
the final few wagons. In icy calm he channeled Air to snare Lanfear; Egwene and Aviendha could
shield her while he distracted her.
Something severed his flows; they snapped back so hard that he grunted.
“One of them?” Lanfear snarled. “Which is Aviendha?” Egwene threw her head back and
wailed, eyes bulging, the world’s agony shrieking from her mouth. “Which?” Aviendha rose on
tiptoes, shuddering, howls chasing Egwene’s as they climbed higher and higher.
The thought was suddenly there in the emptiness. Spirit woven so, with Fire and Earth. There.
Rand felt something being cut, something he could not see, and Egwene collapsed in a motionless
heap, Aviendha to hands and knees, head down and swaying.
Lanfear staggered, her eyes going from the women to him, dark pools of black fire. “You are
mine, Lews Therin! Mine!”
“No.” Rand’s voice seemed to come to his ears down a mile-long tunnel. Distract her from the
girls. He kept moving forward, did not look back. “I was never yours, Mierin. I will always belong
to Ilyena.” The Void quivered with sorrow and loss. And with desperation, as he fought something
besides the scouring of saidin. For a moment he hung balanced. I am Rand al’Thor. And, Ilyena, ever
and always my heart. Balanced on a razor edge. I am Rand al’Thor! Other thoughts tried to well up,
a fountain of them, of Ilyena, of Mierin, of what he could do to defeat her. He forced them down, even
the last. If he came down on the wrong side . . . I am Rand al’Thor! “Your name is Lanfear, and I’ll
die before I love one of the Forsaken.”
Something that might have been anguish crossed her face; then it was a marble mask once more.
“If you are not mine,” she said coldly, “then you are dead.”
Agony in his chest, as if his heart was about to explode, in his head, white-hot nails driving into
his brain, pain so strong that inside the Void he wanted to scream. Death was there, and he knew it.
Frantically—even in the Void, frantic; emptiness shimmered, dwindled—he wove Spirit and Fire and
Earth, flailing it wildly. His heart was no longer beating. Fingers of dark pain crushing the Void. Gray
veil falling over his eyes. He felt his weave slice raggedly through hers. The burn of breath in empty
lungs, lurch of heart beginning to pump again. He could see again, silver and black flecks floated
between him and a stone-faced Lanfear still catching her balance from the rebound of her flows. The
pain was there in head and chest like wounds, but the Void firmed, and bodily pain was remote.
Well that it was distant, for he had no time to recover. Forcing himself to move forward, he
struck at her with Air, a club to knock her senseless. She slashed the weave, and he struck again,
again, again each time that she sliced through his last weave, a furious rain of blows she somehow
saw and countered, always moving closer. If he could keep her occupied for a moment more, if one of
those invisible cudgels landed on her head, if he could get close enough to strike her with his fist . . .
Unconscious, she would be as helpless as anyone else.
Suddenly she seemed to realize what he was doing. Still blocking his blows as easily as if she
could see every one, she danced backwards until her shoulders hit the wagon behind her. And she

smiled like winter’s heart. “You will die slowly, and beg me to let you love me before you die,” she
said.
It was not at him directly that she struck this time. It was at his link to saidin.
Panic rang the Void like a gong at the first knife-sharp touch, the Power diminishing as it slid
deeper between him and the Source. With Spirit and Fire and Earth he cut at the knife blade; he knew
where to find it; he knew where his link was, could feel that first nick. Her attempted shield vanished,
reappeared, returned as fast as he could cut it, but always with that momentary ebbing of saidin,
moments when it almost failed, leaving his counterstroke barely enough to foil her attack. Handling
two weaves at once should have been easy—he could handle ten or more—but not when one was a
desperate defense against something he could not know was there until it was almost too late. Not
when another man’s thoughts kept trying to surface inside the Void, trying to tell him how to defeat
her. If he listened, it might be Lews Therin Telamon who walked away, with Rand al’Thor a voice
sometimes floating in his head if that.
“I’ll make both of those trulls watch you beg,” Lanfear said. “But should I make them watch you
die first, or you them?” When had she climbed into the open wagon bed? He had to watch her, watch
for any hint that she was tiring, her concentration slipping. It was a vain hope. Standing beside the
twisted doorframe ter’angreal, she looked down at him, a queen about to pass sentence, yet she could
spare time for chill smiles at a dark ivory bracelet that she turned over and over in her fingers.
“Which will hurt you most, Lews Therin? I want you to hurt. I want you to know pain such as no man
has ever known!”
The thicker the flow to him from the Source, the harder it would be to cut. His hand tightened on
his coat pocket, the fat little stone man with his sword hard against the heron branded into his palm.
He drew on saidin as deeply as he could, till the taint floated in the emptiness with him like misting
rain.
“Pain, Lews Therin.”
And there was pain, the world swallowed in agony. Not heart or head this time, but everywhere,
every part of him, hot needles stabbing into the Void. He almost thought he could hear a quenching
hiss at each thrust, and each came deeper than the last. Her attempts to shield him did not slow; they
came faster, stronger. He could not believe she was so strong. Clinging to the Void, to searing,
freezing saidin, he defended himself wildly. He could end it, finish her. He could call down lightning,
or wrap her in the fire she herself had used to kill.
Images darted through the pain. A woman in a dark merchant’s dress, toppling from her horse,
the fire-red sword light in his hands; she had come to kill him, with a fistful of other Darkfriends.
Mat’s bleak eyes; I killed her. A golden-haired woman lying in a ruined hallway where, it seemed,
the very walls had melted and flowed. Ilyena, forgive me! It was a despairing cry.
He could end it. Only, he could not. He was going to die, perhaps the world would die, but he
could not make himself kill another woman. Somehow it seemed the richest joke the world had ever
seen.
Wiping the blood from her mouth, Moiraine crawled out from beneath the tail of the wagon and
rose unsteadily to her feet, the sound of a man’s laughter in her ears. In spite of herself, her eyes
darted, searching for Lan, found him lying almost against the foggy gray wall of the dome that
stretched overhead. He twitched, perhaps trying to find strength to rise, perhaps dying. She forced him
out of her mind. He had saved her life so many times that by rights it should have belonged to him, but
she had long since done what she could to see that he survived his lone war with the Shadow. Now he

must live or die without her.
It was Rand laughing, on his knees on the stones of the quay. Laughing, with tears streaming
down a face twisted like a man being put to the question. Moiraine felt a chill. If the madness had
him, it was beyond her. She could only do what she could do. What she must do.
The sight of Lanfear hit her like a blow. Not surprise, but the shock of seeing what had been in
her dreams so often since Rhuidean. Lanfear standing on the wagon bed, blazing bright as the sun with
saidar, framed by the twisted redstone ter’angreal as she stared down at Rand, a pitiless smile on
her lips. She was turning a bracelet in her hands. An angreal; unless Rand had his own angreal, she
should be able to crush him with that. Either he did, or Lanfear was toying with him. It did not matter.
Moiraine did not like that circle of carved age-dark ivory. At first glance it seemed to be an acrobat
bending backwards to grip his ankles. Only a closer look would show that his wrists and ankles were
bound together. She did not like it, but she had brought it out of Rhuidean. Yesterday she had taken the
bracelet from a sack of odds-and-ends and left it lying there at the foot of the doorframe.
Moiraine was slight, a small woman. Her weight did not disturb the wagon at all as she pulled
herself up. She winced as her dress caught on a splinter and tore, but Lanfear did not look around.
The woman had dealt with every threat except Rand; he was the only corner of the world she
acknowledged in the least right then.
Suppressing a small bubble of hope—she could not allow herself that luxury—Moiraine
balanced upright a moment on the wagon tail, then embraced the True Source and leaped at Lanfear.
The Forsaken had an instant’s warning, enough to turn before Moiraine struck her, clawing the
bracelet away. Face to face, they toppled through the doorframe ter’angreal. White light swallowed
everything.

CHAPTER
53

Fading Words

In the depths of a shrinking Void, Rand saw Moiraine hurtle seemingly out of nowhere to
grapple with Lanfear. The attacks on him ceased as the two women plunged through the doorframe
ter’angreal in a flash of white light that did not end; it filled the subtly twisted redstone rectangle as
though trying to flood through and striking some invisible barrier. Lightnings arched silver and blue
around the ter’angreal, more and more violently; rasping buzzes crackled through the air.
Rand staggered to his feet. The pain was not gone really, but the pressure was, bringing promise
that the pain would go. His eyes could not leave the ter’angreal. Moiraine. Her name hung in his
head, sliding across the Void.
Lan lurched by him, fixed on the wagon, leaning as if only by moving forward could he stop from
falling.
More than standing was beyond Rand for the moment. He channeled, caught the Warder in flows
of Air. “You . . . You can’t do anything, Lan. You can’t go after her.”
“I know,” Lan said hopelessly. Held in mid-step, he did not struggle, only stared at the
ter’angreal that had swallowed Moiraine. “The Light send me peace, I know.”
The wagon itself had caught fire now. Rand tried to suppress the flames, but as soon as he drew
the heat from one blaze, the lightnings ignited another. The doorframe itself was beginning to smoke,
though it was stone, a white, acrid smoke that gathered thickly under the gray dome. Even a whiff
burned Rand’s nostrils and made him cough; his skin prickled and stung where the smoke brushed.
Hastily he untied the weave of the dome, dispelled it rather than wait for it to dissipate, and wove
around the wagon a tall chimney of Air that gleamed like glass to carry the fumes high and away. Only
then did he release Lan. He would not have put it past the man to follow Moiraine anyway if he could
have reached the wagon. It was all in flames now, the redstone doorway as well, melting as if it were
wax, but for a Warder that might not matter.
“She is gone. I cannot feel her presence.” The words sounded ripped out of Lan’s chest. He
turned and began walking down the line of wagons without a backward glance.
Following the Warder with his eyes, Rand saw Aviendha on her knees, holding Egwene.
Releasing saidin, he began to run down the quay. Physical pain that had been distant crashed home,
but he ran, however awkwardly. Asmodean was there, too, looking around as if he expected Lanfear
to leap out from behind a wagon or a toppled grain cart. And Mat, squatting with his spear propped
across his shoulder, fanning Egwene with his hat.
Rand skidded to a halt. “Is she . . . ?”
“I don’t know,” Mat said miserably.
“She still breathes.” Aviendha sounded uncertain how long that would continue, but Egwene’s

eyes fluttered open as Amys and Bair pushed roughly past Rand with Melaine and Sorilea. The Wise
Ones knelt clustered around the younger women, murmuring to themselves and each other as they
examined Egwene.
“I feel . . .” Egwene began weakly, and stopped to swallow. Her face was bloodless pale. “I . . .
hurt.” A tear leaked from one eye.
“Of course you do,” Sorilea said briskly. “That is what happens when you let yourself be caught
in a man’s schemes.”
“She cannot go with you, Rand al’Thor.” Melaine’s sun-haired beauty was openly angry, but she
was not looking at him; it could have been anger at him or anger at what had happened.
“I . . . will be right as wellwater . . . with a little rest,” Egwene whispered.
Bair dampened a cloth from a waterskin and laid it across Egwene’s forehead. “You will be
right with a great deal of rest. I fear you will not be meeting Nynaeve and Elayne tonight. You will
not go near Tel’aran’rhiod for some days, until you are stronger again. Do not give me that stubborn
look, girl. We will watch your dreams to make sure, if need be, and give your care to Sorilea if you
so much as think of disobeying.”
“You will not disobey me more than once, Aes Sedai or not,” Sorilea said, but with a touch of
sympathy at odds with her leathery-faced grimness. Frustration was plain in Egwene’s face.
“I, at least, am well enough to do what must be done,” Aviendha said. In truth, she looked not
much less haggard than Egwene, but she managed a defiant stare at Rand, plainly expecting argument.
Her defiance faded somewhat when she realized the four Wise Ones were looking at her. “I am,” she
muttered.
“Of course,” Rand said hollowly.
“I am,” she insisted. To him; she carefully avoided meeting the Wise Ones’ gaze. “Lanfear had
me a moment less than she did Egwene. That was enough to make the difference between us. I have
toh to you, Rand al’Thor. I do not think we would have survived many moments more. She was very
strong.” Her eyes darted down to the burning wagon. Fierce flames had already reduced it to a
shapeless charred pile inside the glassy chimney; the redstone ter’angreal was no longer visible at
all. “I did not see all that happened.”
“They are . . .” Rand cleared his throat. “They are both gone. Lanfear is dead. And so is
Moiraine.” Egwene began to cry, sobs shaking her in Aviendha’s clasp. Aviendha put her head down
on the other woman’s shoulder as if she, too, might weep.
“You are a fool, Rand al’Thor,” Amys said, standing. That surprisingly youthful face beneath her
headscarf and white hair was stone hard. “About this and many other things, you are a fool.”
He turned away from the accusation in her eyes. Moiraine was dead. Dead because he could not
bring himself to kill one of the Forsaken. He did not know whether he wanted to cry or laugh wildly;
if he did either, he did not think he would be able to stop.
The dockside that had been emptying when he made the dome was filled again, though few came
nearer than where that misty gray wall had stood. Wise Ones moved about aiding the burned,
comforting the dying, assisted by white-robed gai’shain and men in the cadin’sor. Moans and cries
stabbed at him. He had not been quick enough. Moiraine dead; no Healing for even the worst injured.
Because he . . . I could not. The Light help me, I could not!
More Aielmen stood watching him, some only now unveiling; he still did not see one Maiden.
Not only Aiel were there. Dobraine, bareheaded on a black gelding, did not take his eyes from Rand,
and not far off Talmanes and Nalesean and Daerid sat their horses watching Mat almost as closely as
they did Rand. People lined the top of the great city wall, outlined and cast in shadow by the rising

sun, and more along the curtain walls. Two of those shadowed shapes turned away when he looked
up, saw each other only twenty paces apart, and seemed to recoil. He would have wagered they were
Meilan and Maringil.
Lan was back with the horses at the last wagon in the line, stroking Aldieb’s white nose.
Moiraine’s mare.
Rand went to him. “I’m sorry, Lan. If I’d been faster, if I’d . . .” He exhaled heavily. I couldn’t
kill one, so I killed the other. The Light burn me blind! If it had, at that moment, he would not have
cared.
“The Wheel weaves.” Lan went to Mandarb, busied himself checking the black stallion’s
saddlegirth. “She was a soldier, a warrior in her way as much as I. This could have happened two
hundred times these past twenty years. She knew it, and so did I. It was a good day to die.” His voice
was as hard as it had ever been, but those cold blue eyes were red-rimmed.
“Still, I am sorry. I should have . . .” The man would not be comforted by should-haves, and they
dug at Rand’s soul. “I hope you can still be my friend, Lan, after. . . . I value your counsel—and your
sword-training—and I’ll need both in the days to come.”
“I am your friend, Rand. But I cannot stay.” Lan swung up into his saddle. “Moiraine did
something to me that has not been done in hundreds of years, not since the time when Aes Sedai still
sometimes bonded a Warder whether he wanted it or not. She altered my bond so it passed to another
when she died. Now I must find that other, become one of her Warders. I am one, already. I can feel
her faintly, somewhere far to the west, and she can feel me. I must go, Rand. It is part of what
Moiraine did. She said she would not allow me time to die avenging her.” He gripped the reins as if
holding Mandarb back, as if holding himself back from digging his spurs in. “If you ever see Nynaeve
again, tell her . . .” For an instant that stone face crumpled in anguish; an instant, then it was granite
again. He muttered under his breath, but Rand heard. “A clean wound heals quickest and pains
shortest.” Aloud, he said, “Tell her I’ve found someone else. Green sisters are sometimes as close to
their Warders as other women are to husbands. In every way. Tell her I’ve gone to be a Green sister’s
lover, as well as her sword. These things happen. It has been a long time since I’ve seen her.”
“I will tell her whatever you say, Lan, but I don’t know that she’ll believe me.”
Lan bent from the saddle to catch Rand’s shoulder in a hard grip. Rand remembered calling the
man a half-tame wolf, but those eyes made a wolf seem a lapdog. “We are alike in many ways, you
and I. There is a darkness in us. Darkness, pain, death. They radiate from us. If ever you love a
woman, Rand, leave her and let her find another. It will be the best gift you can give her.”
Straightening, he raised one hand. “Peace favor your sword. Tai’shar Manetheren.” The ancient
salute. True blood of Manetheren.
Rand lifted his hand. “Tai’shar Malkier.”
Lan heeled Mandarb’s flanks, and the stallion leaped forward, scattering Aiel and everyone else
from his path, as if to carry the last of the Malkieri wherever he was headed at a gallop the entire
way.
“The last embrace of the mother welcome you home, Lan,” Rand murmured, then shivered. That
was part of the funeral service in Shienar, and elsewhere in the Borderlands.
They were still watching him, the Aiel, the people atop the walls. The Tower would know of
today, or a version of it, as soon as a pigeon could fly there. If Rahvin did have some way of
watching as well—all it took was one raven in the city, one rat here along the river—he certainly
would not expect anything today. Elaida would think him weakened, perhaps more pliable, and
Rahvin . . .

He realized what he was doing and winced. Stop it! For one minute at least, stop and mourn!
He did not want all those eyes on him. Aiel fell back before him almost as readily as they had before
Mandarb.
The dockmaster’s slate-roofed hut was a single windowless stone room lined with shelves full
of ledgers and scrolls and papers, lit by two lamps on a rough table covered with tax seals and
customs stamps. Rand slammed the door behind him to shut out eyes.
Moiraine dead, Egwene injured, and Lan gone. A high price to pay for Lanfear.
“Mourn, burn you!” he growled. “She deserved that much! Don’t you have any feelings left?” But
mostly he felt numb. His body hurt, but under it was deadness.
Hunching his shoulders, he stuffed his hands into his pockets and felt Moiraine’s letters. Slowly
he drew them out. Some things he should think on, she had said. Stuffing Thom’s back, he broke the
seal on the other. The pages were covered thickly with Moiraine’s elegant script.
These words will fade within moments after this leaves your hands—a warding attuned to you
—so be careful of it. That you are reading this means that events have fallen out at the docks
as I hoped. . . .
He stopped, staring, then read on quickly.
Since the first day I reached Rhuidean, I have known—it need not trouble you how; some
secrets belong to others, and I will not betray them—that a day would come in Cairhien when
news would arrive of Morgase. I did not know what that would be—if what we heard is true,
the Light have mercy on her soul; she was willful and stubborn, with the temper of a lioness
at times, but for all that a true, good and gracious queen—but each time that news led to the
docks on the following day. There were three branches from the docks, but if you are reading
this, I am gone, and so is Lanfear. . . .
Rand’s hands tightened on the pages. She had known. Known, and still she brought him here.
Hurriedly he smoothed out the crumpled paper.
The other two paths were much worse. Down one, Lanfear killed you. Down the other, she
carried you away, and when next we saw you, you called yourself Lews Therin Telamon and
were her devoted lover.
I hope that Egwene and Aviendha have survived unharmed. You see, I do not know what
happens in the world after, except perhaps for one small thing which does not concern you.
I could not tell you, for the same reason I could not tell Lan. Even given the choices, I
could not be sure which you would pick. Men of the Two Rivers, it seems, retain much of
storied Manetheren in them, traits shared with men of the Borderlands. It is said that a
Borderlander will take a dagger’s wound to avoid harm to a woman and count it fair trade. I
dared not risk that you would place my life above your own, certain that somehow you could
sidestep fate. Not a risk, I fear, but a foolish certainty, as today has surely proved. . . .
“My choice, Moiraine,” he muttered. “It was my choice.”
A few final points.
If Lan has not already gone, tell him that what I did to him, I did for the best. He will
understand one day, and I hope, bless me for it.
Trust no woman fully who is now Aes Sedai. I do not speak simply of the Black Ajah, though
you must always be watchful for them. Be as suspicious of Verin as you are of Alviarin. We

have made the world dance as we sang for three thousand years. That is a difficult habit to
break, as I have learned while dancing to your song. You must dance free, and even the best
intentioned of my sisters may well try to guide your steps as I once did.
Please deliver Thom Merrilin’s letter safely when you meet him again. There is a small
matter that I once told him of which I must make clear for his peace of mind.
Lastly, be wary, too, of Master Jasin Natael. I cannot approve wholly, but I understand.
Perhaps it was the only way. Yet be careful of him. He is the same man now that he always
was. Remember that always.
May the Light illumine and protect you. You will do well.
It was signed simply “Moiraine.” She had almost never used her House name.
He reread the second last paragraph again closely. Somehow she had known who Asmodean
was. It had to be that. Known that one of the Forsaken was right there in front of her, and never
blinked once. She had known why, too, if he read it right. He would have thought in a letter that
would go blank when he set it down, she could have come right out and said what she meant. Not just
concerning Asmodean. About how she had learned what she had in Rhuidean—something to do with
Wise Ones, or he missed his guess, and as much chance of finding out more from the letter as from
them—about Aes Sedai—was there a reason she mentioned Verin? And why Alviarin instead of
Elaida?—even about Thom and Lan. For some reason he did not think she had left a letter for Lan; the
Warder was not the only one who believed in clean wounds. He almost took Thom’s letter out and
opened it, but she might have warded it the same way she had his. Aes Sedai and Cairhienin, she had
wrapped herself in mystery and manipulation to the end. To the end.
That was what he was trying to avoid with all this blather about her keeping secrets. She had
known what would happen and come as bravely as any Aiel. Come to her death knowing it waited.
She had died because he could not bring himself to kill Lanfear. He could not kill one woman, so
another died. His eyes fell on the last words.
. . . You will do well.
They cut like a cold razor.
“Why do you weep here alone, Rand al’Thor? I have heard that some wetlanders think it is
shame to be seen weeping.”
He glared at Sulin, standing in the doorway. She was fully accoutred, cased bow on her back,
quiver at her belt, round hide buckler and three spears in hand. “I’m not. . . .” There was dampness on
his cheeks. He scrubbed it away. “It’s hot in here. Makes me sweat like a . . . What do you want? I
thought you had all decided to abandon me and go back to the Three-fold Land.”
“It is not we who have abandoned you, Rand al’Thor.” Shutting the door behind her, she sat on
the floor and laid her buckler and a pair of the spears down. “You have abandoned us.” In one motion
she put a foot against the last spear between her hands, heaved, and snapped it in two.
“What are you doing?” She tossed aside the pieces and picked up another spear. “I said, what
are you doing?” The white-haired Maiden’s face might have given even Lan pause, but Rand bent and
seized the spear between her hands; her soft-booted foot came to rest against his knuckles. Not lightly.
“Will you put us in skirts, and make us marry and tend hearth? Or are we to lie beside your fire
and lick your hand when you give us a scrap of meat?” Her muscles tensed, and the spear broke,
scoring his palm with splinters.
He snatched his freed hand back with a curse, shaking off droplets of blood. “I don’t mean any
such thing. I thought you understood.” She took up the last spear, set her foot, and he channeled,
weaving Air to hold her as she was. She only stared at him wordlessly. “Burn me, you said nothing!

So I kept the Maidens out of the battle with Couladin. Not everyone fought that day. And you never
said a word.”
Sulin’s eyes widened in incredulity. “You kept us from the dance of spears? We kept you from
the dance. You were like a girl newly wed to the spear, ready to rush out and kill Couladin with
never a thought for the spear you might take from behind. You are the Car’a’carn. You have no right
to risk yourself needlessly.” Her voice flattened. “Now you go to fight the Forsaken. The secret is
well kept, but I have heard enough from those who lead the other societies.”
“And you want to keep me out of this fight as well?” he said quietly.
“Do not be a fool, Rand al’Thor. Any could have danced the spears with Couladin; for you to
risk it was the thinking of a child. None among us can face the Shadowsouled, save you.”
“Then why . . . ?” He stopped; he already knew the answer. After that blood-soaked day against
Couladin, he had convinced himself they would not mind. He had wanted to believe they would not.
“Those who go with you have been chosen.” The words came like hurled stones. “Men from
every society. Men. There are no Maidens, Rand al’Thor. Far Dareis Mai carries your honor, and
you take ours away.”
He drew a deep breath, fumbling for words. “I . . . do not like to see a woman die. I hate it,
Sulin. It curdles me up inside. I could not kill a woman if my life hung on it.” The pages of Moiraine’s
letter rustled in his hand. Dead because he could not kill Lanfear. Not always just his own life.
“Sulin, I would rather go against Rahvin alone than see one of you die.”
“A foolish thing. Everyone needs another to watch her back. So it is Rahvin. Even Roidan of the
Thunder Walkers and Turol of the Stone Dogs held that back.” She glanced at her upraised foot, held
against the spear by the same flows that snared her arms. “Release me, and we will talk.”
After a moment’s hesitation, he unraveled the weave. He was tensed to seize her again if need
be, but she only crossed her legs and sat bouncing the spear on her palms. “Sometimes I forget you
were raised out of our blood, Rand al’Thor. Listen to me. I am what I am. This is what I am.” She
hefted the spear.
“Sulin—”
“Listen, Rand al’Thor. I am the spear. When a lover came between me and the spear, I chose the
spear. Some chose the other way. Some decide they have run with the spears long enough, that they
want a husband, a child. I have never wanted anything else. No chief would hesitate to send me
wherever the dance is hottest. If I died there, my first-sisters would mourn me, but not a fingernail
more than when our first-brother fell. A treekiller who stabbed me to the heart in my sleep would do
me more honor than you do. Do you understand now?”
“I understand, but . . .” He did understand. She did not want him to make her something other
than what she was. All he had to do was be willing to watch her die. “What happens if you break the
last spear?”
“If I have no honor in this life, perhaps in another.” She said it as if it was just another
explanation. It took him a moment to comprehend. All he had to do was be willing to watch her die.
“You don’t leave me any choices, do you?” No more than Moiraine had.
“There are always choices, Rand al’Thor. You have a choice, and I have one. Ji’e’toh allows
no other.”
He wanted to snarl at her, to curse ji’e’toh and everyone who followed it. “Choose out your
Maidens, Sulin. I don’t know how many I can take, but Far Dareis Mai will have as many as any
other society.”
He stalked past her and her sudden smile. Not relief. Pleasure. Pleasure that she would have the

chance to die. He should have left her wrapped up in saidin, left her to be dealt with somehow when
he came back from Caemlyn. Slamming the door open, he strode out onto the quay—and stopped.
Enaila headed a line of Maidens, each with three spears in her hands, a line leading back from
the dockmaster’s door, vanishing into the nearest of the gates to the city. Some of the Aielmen on the
dockside eyed them curiously, but it was obviously something between Far Dareis Mai and the
Car’a’carn, and no business of any other society. Amys and three or four other Wise Ones who had
once been Maidens were watching more closely. Most of the non-Aiel had gone, except for a few
men nervously righting overturned grain carts and trying to look elsewhere. Enaila stepped toward
Rand, then halted and smiled as Sulin came out. Not relief. Pleasure. Smiles of pleasure running back
down that long line of Maidens. Smiles on those Wise Ones, too, and a sharp nod for him from Amys
as if he had put an end to some idiotic behavior.
“I thought maybe they were going to go in one at a time and kiss you out of your miseries,” Mat
said.
Rand frowned at him, standing there leaning on his spear and grinning, wide-brimmed hat tipped
back on his head. “How can you be so cheerful?” The smell of seared flesh still hung in the air, and
the moans of burned men and women being cared for by Wise Ones.
“Because I’m alive,” Mat snarled. “What do you want me to do, cry?” He shrugged
uncomfortably. “Amys says Egwene really will be all right in a few days.” He did look around then,
but as though he did not want to see what he saw. “Burn me, if we’re going to do this thing, let’s do it.
Dovie’andi se tovya sagain.”
“What?”
“I said, it’s time to roll the dice. Did Sulin stop up your ears?”
“Time to roll the dice,” Rand agreed. The flames had died inside the glassy chimney of Air, but
the white smoke still rose as though flames yet consumed the ter’angreal. Moiraine. He should have
. . . Done was done. The Maidens were crowding down around Sulin, as many as would fit onto the
quay. Done was done, and he had to live with it. Death would be a release from what he had to live
with. “Let’s do it.”

CHAPTER
54

To Caemlyn

Five hundred of the Maidens behind Sulin accompanied Rand back to the Royal Palace, where
Bael waited in the great court inside the front gates with Thunder Walkers and Black Eyes and Water
Seekers and men from every other society, their numbers filling the courtyard and crowding back into
the palace through every door down to the smallest servants’ way. Some watched from lower
windows, waiting their turn to come out. The surrounding stone balconies were empty. In the entire
courtyard only one man waited who was not Aiel; Tairens and Cairhienin—especially Cairhienin—
stayed clear when Aiel gathered. The exception stood above Bael on the wide gray steps leading into
the place. Pevin, with the crimson banner hanging limply from its staff, and no more expression
surrounded by Aiel than at any other time.
Aviendha, behind Rand’s saddle, clung tightly to him, breasts pressed against his back, until the
very moment he dismounted. There had been an exchange between her and some of the Wise Ones
back at the docks that he did not think he had been supposed to hear.
“Go with the Light,” Amys had said, touching Aviendha’s face. “And guard him closely. You
know how much depends on him.”
“Much depends on you both,” Bair told Aviendha, almost at the same time that Melaine said
irritably, “It would be easier if you had succeeded by now.”
Sorilea snorted. “Even Maidens knew how to handle men in my day.”
“She has been more successful than you know,” Amys told them. Aviendha shook her head;
the roses-and-thorns ivory bracelet slid down her arm as she raised a hand to forestall the other
woman, but Amys went on over her half-formed protests. “I have waited for her to tell us, but since
she will not—” She saw him then, standing only ten feet away, with Jeade’en’s reins in his hand,
and cut off sharply. Aviendha turned to see what Amys was staring at; when her eyes found him,
bright crimson suffused her face, then drained away so suddenly that even her sun-dark cheeks
looked pale. The four Wise Ones fixed him with flat, unreadable gazes.
Asmodean and Mat came up behind him, leading their horses. “Do women learn that look in
the cradle?” Mat muttered. “Do their mothers teach them? I’d say the mighty Car’a’carn will get
his ears singed if he stays around here much longer.”
Shaking his head, Rand reached up as Aviendha swung a leg over to slide down, and lifted her
from the dapple’s back. For a moment he held her by the waist, looking down into her clear bluegreen eyes. She did not look away, and her expression never changed, but her hands tightened slowly
on his forearms. What success was she supposed to have? He had thought she was set to spy on him
for the Wise Ones, but if she ever asked a question about things he held back from the Wise Ones, it
was in open anger at him for keeping secrets from them. Never slyly, never trying to ferret something
out. Bludgeon, maybe, but never ferret. He had considered the possibility that she was like one of

Colavaere’s young women, but only for the brief moment it took to think of the notion. Aviendha
would never let herself be used in that way. Besides, even if she had, giving him one taste of herself
then denying him so much as a kiss afterward, not to mention making him chase her halfway around
the world, was no way to go about it. If she was more than casual about being naked in front of him,
Aiel customs were different. If his distress at it satisfied her, likely it was because she thought it was
a great joke to play on him. So what was she supposed to be successful at? Plots all around him. Was
everyone scheming? He could see his face in her eyes. Who had given her that silver necklace?
“I like canoodling as much as the next man,” Mat said, “but don’t you think there are a few too
many people watching?”
Rand released Aviendha’s waist and stepped back, but no more quickly than she. She bent her
head, fussing with her skirt, muttering about how riding had disarrayed it, but not before he saw her
cheeks redden. Well, he had not meant to embarrass her.
Scowling around the courtyard, he said, “I told you I don’t know how many I can take, Bael.”
With the Maidens spilling back through the gates onto the ramp, there was barely room to move in the
courtyard. Five hundred from each society meant six thousand Aiel; the hallways inside must be
packed.
The towering Aiel chief shrugged. Like every other Aiel there, he had his shoufa wrapped
around his head, ready to veil. No crimson headband, though it seemed at least half the others wore
the black-and-white disc on their foreheads. “Every spear that can follow you, will. Will the two Aes
Sedai come soon?”
“No.” It was good that Aviendha kept her promise not to let him touch her again. Lanfear had
tried to kill her and Egwene because she did not know which was Aviendha. How had Kadere found
out to tell her? No matter. Lan was right. Women found pain—or death—when they came too close to
him. “They will not be coming.”
“There are stories of . . . trouble . . . by the river.”
“A great victory, Bael,” Rand said wearily. “And much honor earned.” But not by me. Pevin
came down past Bael to stand behind Rand’s shoulder with the banner, his narrow, scarred face
absolutely blank. “Does the whole palace know about this, then?” Rand asked.
“I heard,” Pevin said. His jaw worked, chewing for more words. Rand had found him a
replacement for his patched country coat, good red wool, and the man had had Dragons embroidered
on it, one climbing either side of his chest. “That you were going. Somewhere.” That seemed to
exhaust his store.
Rand nodded. Rumors grew in the palace like mushrooms in the shade. But as long as Rahvin
did not find out. He scanned the tile roofs and towertops. No ravens. He had not seen a raven in some
time, though he heard of other men killing them. Perhaps they avoided him now. “Stand ready.” He
seized saidin, floated in emptiness, emotionless.
The gateway appeared at the foot of the steps, first a bright line that seemed to turn, opening into
a square hole into blackness four paces wide. Not a murmur came from the Aiel. Those beyond would
be able to see him as through a smoked glass, a dusky shimmering in the air, but they could as well try
walking through one of the palace walls. From the side, the gateway would be invisible except to the
few close enough to see what might seem a long, fine hair drawn tight.
Four paces was as large as Rand could make it. There were limits for one man by himself,
Asmodean claimed; it seemed there were always limits. The amount of saidin you drew did not
matter. The One Power had little to do with gateways, really; only the making. Beyond, was
something else. A dream of a dream, Asmodean called it.

He stepped through onto what appeared to be a paving stone lifted from the courtyard, but here
the gray square hung in the midst of utter darkness, with a sense that in every direction there was
nothing. Nothing, forever. It was not like night. He could see himself and the stone perfectly. But
everything else, everywhere else, was blackness.
It was time to see how large he could make a platform. With the thought, more stones appeared
all at once, duplicating the courtyard to an inch. He imagined it larger still. That quickly, gray stone
stretched as far as he could see. With a start, he realized that his boots were beginning to sink into the
stone under his feet; it looked no different, yet it yielded slowly like mud, oozing up around his boots.
Hastily, he brought everything back to a square the size of what was outside—that much stayed solid
—then began increasing it by one outer row of stones at a time. It did not take long to realize he could
not make the platform much larger than his first attempt. The stone still looked all right, it did not sink
beneath his feet, but the second added row felt . . . insubstantial, like a thin shell that might crack at a
wrong step. Was that because this was as large as the thing could be made? Or because he had not
thought of it larger at first? We all make our limits. The thought slid up surprisingly from somewhere.
And we set them further out than we have any right.
Rand felt himself shiver. In the Void, it seemed like feeling someone else shiver. It was well to
be reminded that Lews Therin was still inside him. He had to be careful not to fall into a battle for
self while confronting Rahvin. If not for that, he might have . . . No. What had happened on the quay
was done; he would not make a hash of it for breakfast.
Reducing the platform by one outer ring of square stones, he turned. Bael was waiting out there
in what seemed a huge square doorway into daylight with the steps beyond. At his side, Pevin looked
no more perturbed by what he saw than the Aiel chief, which was to say not at all. Pevin would carry
that banner wherever Rand went, even the Pit of Doom, and never blink. Mat shoved back his hat to
scratch his head, then jerked it low again, muttering something about dice in his head.
“Impressive,” Asmodean said quietly. “Quite impressive.”
“Flatter him some other time, harper,” Aviendha said.
She was the first to step through, watching Rand, not where she put her feet. She walked all the
way to him without once so much as glancing at anything except his face. When she reached him,
though, it was to swing away abruptly, settle her shawl over her elbows, and study the darkness.
Sometimes women were stranger than anything else the Creator could possibly have made.
Bael and Pevin came right behind her; then Asmodean, one hand clutching the strap of his
harpcase across his chest, the other white-knuckled on his sword hilt; and Mat, swaggering, but a
trifle reluctant and grumbling as if arguing with himself. In the Old Tongue. Sulin claimed the honor to
be first else, but soon a wide stream followed, not just Maidens of the Spear, but Tain Shari, True
Bloods, and Far Aldazar Din, Brothers of the Eagle; Red Shields and Dawn Runners, Stone Dogs and
Knife Hands, representatives of every society, crowding through.
As the numbers increased, Rand moved to the far side of the platform from the gateway. There
was no need to see where he was going, really, but he wanted to. In truth, he could have remained at
the other end, or gone to one side; direction here was mutable; whatever way he chose to move would
take him to Caemlyn if done properly. And to the endless black of nowhere if done wrong.
Except for Bael and Sulin—and Aviendha, of course—the Aiel left a little space around him and
Mat, Asmodean and Pevin. “Stay away from the edge,” Rand said. The Aiel nearest him moved back
all of a foot. He could not see over the forest of shoufa-shrouded heads. “Is it full?” he called. The
thing might hold half those who wanted to go, but not many more. “Is it full?”
“Yes,” a woman’s voice called back finally, reluctantly—he thought it sounded like Lamelle—

but there was still a milling in the gateway, Aiel sure there must be room for one more.
“Enough!” Rand shouted. “No more! Clear the gateway! Everyone stand well clear!” He did not
want what had happened to the Seanchan spear to happen here to living flesh.
A pause, and then, “It is clear.” It was Lamelle. He would have bet his last copper that Enaila
and Somara were back there somewhere, too.
The gateway seemed to turn sideways, thinning until it vanished with one final flash of light.
“Blood and ashes!” Mat muttered, leaning disgustedly on his spear. “This is worse than the
flaming Ways!” Which earned him a startled look from Asmodean, and a considering one from Bael.
Mat did not notice; he was too busy glaring at the blackness.
There was no sense of motion, no breeze to stir the banner Pevin held. They could have been
standing still. But Rand knew better; he could almost feel the place they were approaching draw
nearer.
“If you come out too close to him, he will sense it.” Asmodean licked his lips and avoided
looking at anyone. “At least, that is what I have heard.”
“I know where I am going,” Rand said. Not too close. But not too far. He remembered the spot
well.
No movement. Endless black, and them hanging in it. Motionless. Half an hour passed perhaps.
A slight stir ran through the Aiel.
“What is it?” Rand asked.
Murmurs came across the platform. “Someone fell,” a bulky man near him said at last. Rand
recognized him. Meciar. He was Cor Darei, a Night Spear. He wore the red headband.
“Not one of the . . .” Rand began, then caught Sulin looking at him, flat-eyed.
He turned to stare out into the darkness, anger a stain clinging to the emotionless Void. So it was
not supposed to matter more to him if one of the Maidens had fallen, was it? It did. Falling forever
through endless black. Would sanity crack before death came, from starvation or thirst or fear? In that
fall, even an Aiel must eventually find fear strong enough to stop a heart. He almost hoped so; it must
be more merciful than the other.
Burn me, what happened to all that hardness I was so proud of? A Maiden or a Stone Dog, a
spear is a spear. Only, thinking it could not make it so. I will be hard! He would let the Maidens
dance the spears where they wished. He would. And he knew he would search out the name of every
one who died, that every name would be another knife-cut on his soul. I will be hard. The Light help
me, I will. The Light help me.
Seemingly motionless, hanging in blackness.
The platform stopped. It was hard to say how he knew, when he could tell it was moving before,
but he did.
He channeled, and a gateway opened in the same way it had in the courtyard in Cairhien. The
angle of the sun had hardly changed, but here early-morning light shone on a paved street, and a rising
slope patched brown with drought-killed grass and wildflowers, a slope topped by a stone wall two
spans high or more, the stones worked rough so it seemed something natural. Above that wall he
could see the golden domes of the Royal Palace of Andor, a few of the pale spires topped with
banners rippling the White Lion on a breeze. On the other side of that wall was the garden where he
had first met Elayne.
Blue eyes floated accusingly outside the Void, the darting memory of kisses stolen in Tear, the
memory of a letter laying her heart and soul at his feet, of messages borne by Egwene professing love.
What would she say if she ever learned about Aviendha, about that night together in the snow hut?

Memory of another letter, icily spurning him, a queen condemning a swineherd to outer darkness. It
did not matter. Lan was right. But he wanted . . . What? Who? Blue eyes, and green, and dark brown.
Elayne, who maybe loved him and maybe could not make up her mind? Aviendha, who taunted him
with what she would not let him touch? Min, who laughed at him, thought him a wool-headed fool?
All that flashed along the boundaries of the Void. He tried to ignore it, to ignore anguished memories
of another blue-eyed woman, lying dead in a palace corridor, so long ago.
He had to stand there, while Aiel dashed out behind Bael, veiling themselves, spreading left and
right. It was his presence that maintained the platform; it would vanish as soon as he stepped through
the gateway. Aviendha waited almost as calmly as Pevin, though she did occasionally put her head
out to frown faintly in one direction or the other down the street. Asmodean fingered his sword and
breathed too quickly; Rand wondered whether the man knew how to use the thing. Not that he would
have to. Mat stared up the wall as though at a bad remembrance. He had entered the Palace this way
once, too.
The last veiled Aiel went by, and Rand motioned the others out, then followed. The gateway
winked out of existence, leaving him in the middle of a long circle of wary Maidens. Aiel were
running down the curving street—it followed the line of the hill; all the streets of the Inner City
flowed with the land—vanishing around winding corners as they hurried to find and secure anyone
who might give alarm. More were climbing the slope, and some had even begun to scale the wall,
using tiny knobs and ridges for finger- and toe-holds.
Suddenly Rand stared. To his left the street bowed downward and rounded out of sight, the
decline giving a view past tile-covered towers, sparkling in the morning sun with a hundred changing
colors, across tile roofs all the way to one of the Inner City’s many parks, its white walks and
monuments forming a lion’s head when seen from this angle. To his right the street rose a little before
curving away, more towers topped by spires or domes of various shapes glittering above the
rooftops. Aiel filled the street, fanning out quickly into side streets that spiraled away from the
palace. Aiel, and not a soul else. The sun was high enough for people to be out and about their
business, even this close to the Palace.
Like a nightmare the wall above toppled outward in half a dozen places, Aiel and stones
smashing down on those still climbing. Before those bouncing, sliding chunks of masonry reached the
streets, Trollocs appeared in the openings, dropping the tree-thick battering rams they had used and
drawing scythe-curved swords—more, with spiked axes and barbed spears, huge man-shapes in
black mail with spikes at shoulders and elbows, huge man-faces distorted by snouts and muzzles,
beaks and horns and feathers, plunging down the slope with eyeless Myrddraal like midnight serpents
in their midst. All along the street howling Trollocs and silent Myrddraal poured from doorways,
leaped from windows. Lightning stabbed from the cloudless sky.
Rand wove Fire and Air to meet Fire and Air, a slow-spreading shield racing lightnings’ fall.
Too slow. One bolt struck the shield directly above his head, shattering in a blinding glare, but others
grounded themselves, and his hair lifted as the air itself seemed to hammer him down. Almost he lost
the weave, almost the Void itself, but he wove what he could not see through eyes still filled with
coruscating light, spread the shield against bolts from the heavens that he could at least feel
hammering at it. Hammering to reach him, but that could change. Drawing saidin through the angreal
in his pocket, he wove the shield until he was sure it must cover half of the Inner City, then tied it off.
As he pushed himself to his feet, sight began to return, watery and painful at first. He had to move
fast. Rahvin knew he was here. He had to . . .
Surprisingly little time had passed, seemingly. Rahvin had not cared how many of his own he

took. Stunned Trollocs and Myrddraal on the slope were falling to spears in the hands of Maidens,
many of whom moved unsteadily themselves. Some Maidens, those nearest Rand, were only now
pulling themselves up from where they had been flung, and Pevin stood spraddle-legged, holding
himself upright with the red banner’s staff, his scarred face still blank as slate. More Trollocs boiled
through the gaps in the wall above, and the din of battle filled the streets in all directions, but it might
as well have been in another country so far as Rand was concerned.
There had been more than one bolt in that first volley, but not all had been aimed at him. Mat’s
smoking boots lay a dozen paces from where Mat himself sprawled on his back. Tendrils of smoke
rose from the black haft of his spear, too, from his coat, even from the silver foxhead, hanging out of
his shirt, that had not saved him from a man’s channeling. Asmodean was a twisted shape of char,
recognizable only from the blackened harpcase still strapped to his back. And Aviendha . . .
Unmarked, she could have laid down to rest—if she could have rested staring unblinking at the sun.
Rand bent to touch her cheek. Cooling already. It felt . . . Not like flesh.
“RAAAAHVIIIIN!”
It startled him a little, that sound coming from his throat. He seemed to be sitting somewhere
deep in the back of his own head, the Void around him vaster, emptier, than it had ever been before.
Saidin raged through him. He did not care if it scoured him away. The taint seeped through
everything, tarnished everything. He did not care.
Three Trollocs broke past the Maidens, great spiked axes and oddly hooked spears in hairy
hands, all-too-human eyes fixing on him, standing there apparently unarmed. The one with a boar’s
tusked snout went down with Enaila’s spear through its spine. Eagle’s beak and bear’s muzzle raced
on toward him, one on booted feet, the other on paws.
Rand felt himself smile.
Fire burst from the two Trollocs, a flame at every pore, bursting through black mail. Even as
their mouths opened to scream, a gateway opened right where they stood. Bloody halves of burning,
cleanly sliced Trolloc fell, but Rand was staring through the opening. Not into blackness, but a great
columned hall with lion-carved stone panels, where a large man with wings of white in his dark hair
started up in surprise from a gilded throne. A dozen men, some dressed as lords, some in
breastplates, turned to see what their master was looking at.
Rand barely noticed them. “Rahvin,” he said. Or someone did. He was not sure who.
Sending fire and lightning ahead of him, he stepped through and let the gateway close behind
him. He was death.
Nynaeve was having no trouble maintaining the temper that allowed her to channel a flow of
Spirit to the amber sleeping woman in her pouch. Even the feel of unseen eyes could not touch her
through her anger this morning. Siuan stood in front of her on a Salidar street in Tel’aran’rhiod, a
street empty save for them, a few flies, and one fox that paused to look at them curiously before
trotting on.
“You must concentrate,” Nynaeve barked. “You had more control than this the first time.
Concentrate!”
“I am concentrating, you fool girl!” Siuan’s plain blue wool dress was suddenly silk. The sevenstriped stole of the Amyrlin Seat hung around her neck, and a golden serpent bit its own tail on her
finger. Frowning at Nynaeve, she did not seem aware of the change, though she had already worn the
same five times today. “If there’s any difficulty, it lies in that foul-tasting brew you fed me! Faagh! I
can still taste it. Like flatfish gall.” Stole and ring vanished; the silk dress’s high neck plunged low

enough to show the twisted stone ring, dangling between her breasts on a fine gold chain.
“If you didn’t insist on me teaching you when you needed something to help you sleep, you
wouldn’t need it.” So there had been a little sheeps-tongue root and a few other things that were not
really necessary in the mix. The woman deserved to have her tongue curdled.
“You can hardly teach me when you’re teaching Sheriam and the others.” The silk paled; the
neck was high again, surrounded by a white lace ruff, and a cap of pearls fitted close on Siuan’s hair.
“Or would you rather I came after them? You claim you need some sleep undisturbed.”
Nynaeve quivered, fists clenched at her sides. Sheriam and the others were not the worst thing
stoking her anger. She and Elayne took turns bringing them to Tel’aran’rhiod two at a time,
sometimes all six in one night, and even if she was the teacher they never let her forget she was
Accepted and they Aes Sedai. One sharp word when they made a foolish mistake . . . Elayne had only
been sent to scrub pots once, but Nynaeve’s hands were shriveled from hot, soapy water; back where
her body lay sleeping they were, anyway. But they were not the worst. Nor was the fact that she
barely had a moment to spare for investigating what, if anything, could be done about stilling and
gentling. Logain was more cooperative than Siuan and Leane in any case, or at least more eager.
Thank the Light he understood about keeping it secret. Or thought he did; he probably believed she
would Heal him eventually. No, worse than that was that Faolain had been tested and raised . . . not
Aes Sedai—not without the Oath Rod, which was tight in the Tower—but to something more than
Accepted. Faolain wore any dress she chose now, and if she could not wear the shawl or choose an
Ajah, she had been given other authority. Nynaeve thought she had fetched more cups of water, more
books—left deliberately, she was sure!—more pins and inkjars and other useless things in the last
four days than she had her entire stay in the Tower. Yet even Faolain was not the worst of all. She did
not even want to remember that. Her anger could have heated a house in winter.
“What’s put a hook in your gills today, girl?” Siuan had on a gown like those Leane wore, only
more sheer than even Leane would ever wear in public, so thin it was hard to tell what color it was.
Not the first time she had had that on today, either. What was perking around in the back of the
woman’s mind? In the World of Dreams, things like these changes of clothing betrayed thoughts you
might not even know you had. “You have been almost decent company until today,” Siuan continued
irritably, then paused. “Until today. I see it now. Yesterday afternoon Sheriam assigned Theodrin to
begin helping you break down that block you’ve built up. Is that what has your shift in a twist? You
don’t like Theodrin telling you what to do? She’s a wilder, too, girl. If anyone can help you learn to
channel without eating nettles first, she—”
“And what has you so jittery you can’t hold your dress still?” Theodrin—that was what really
hurt. The failure. “Maybe it’s something I heard last night?” Theodrin was even-tempered, goodhumored, patient; she said it could not be done in one session; her own block had taken months to
demolish, and she had finally realized she was channeling long before going to the Tower. Still,
failure hurt, and worst of all, if anyone ever discovered that she had cried like a baby in Theodrin’s
comforting arms when she knew she was failing . . . “I heard you heaved Gareth Bryne’s boots at his
head when he told you to sit down and polish them properly—he still doesn’t know Min does the
polishing, does he?—so he turned you upside down and—”
Siuan’s full-armed slap rung her ears. For an instant she could only stare at the other woman,
eyes going wider and wider. With a wordless shriek, she tried to punch Siuan in the eye. Tried,
because somehow Siuan had tangled a fist in her hair. A moment later they were down in the dirt of
the street, rolling about and screaming, flailing wildly.
Grunting, Nynaeve thought she was getting the better of it even if she did not know whether she

was on the top or the bottom half the time. Siuan was trying to yank her braid out by the roots with one
hand while the other pounded at her ribs or anything else it could find, but she had the other woman
the same way, and Siuan’s yanking and punching were definitely growing weaker, and she herself
was going to pound Siuan senseless in another minute, then snatch her bald. Nynaeve yelped as a toe
caught her hard on the shin. The woman kicked! Nynaeve tried to knee her, but it was not easy in
skirts. Kicking was not fighting fair!
Suddenly Nynaeve realized that Siuan was shaking. At first she thought the woman was crying.
Then she realized it was laughter. Pushing herself up, she brushed strands of hair out of her face—her
braid was all but undone—and glared down at the other woman. “What are you laughing at? Me? If
you are . . . !”
“Not at you. At us.” Still quivering with mirth, Siuan shoved Nynaeve off her. Siuan’s hair was
in wild disarray, and dust covered the plain wool dress she wore now, worn-looking and neatly
darned in several places. She was barefoot, too. “Two grown women, rolling around like . . . I
haven’t done that since I was . . . twelve, I think. I started thinking that all we needed would be fat
Cian snatching me up by an ear to tell me girls don’t fight. I heard she once knocked down a drunken
printer; I don’t know why.” Something very like giggles took her for a moment, then she quieted them
and stood, brushing dust from her clothes. “If we have a disagreement, we can settle it like adult
women.” And in a careful tone, “Still, it might be a good idea not to discuss Gareth Bryne.” She gave
a start as the worn dress became a gown, red with black-and-gold embroidery around hem and
swooping neckline.
Nynaeve sat there staring at her. What would she have done as Wisdom if she found two women
rolling around in the dirt that way? If anything, the answer kept her anger at a simmer. Siuan still did
not seem to realize that there was no need to brush away dust with your hands in Tel’aran’rhiod.
Snatching away fingers that had been repairing her braid, Nynaeve got up quickly; before she was on
her feet again, her braid hung perfect over her shoulder and her good Two Rivers woolens might have
just been laundered.
“I agree,” she said. She would have made any two women she caught like that sorry they had
been born even before she hauled them before the Women’s Circle. What was she doing lashing out
with her fists like some fool man? First Cerandin—she did not want to think about that episode, but
there it was—then Latelle, and now this. Was she going to get around her block by being angry all the
time? Unfortunately—or perhaps fortunately—that thought did nothing for her temper. “If we have
disagreements, we can . . . discuss them.”
“Which I suppose means we’ll shout at one another,” Siuan said dryly. “Well, better that than the
other.”
“We would not have to shout if you—!” Drawing a deep breath, Nynaeve jerked her eyes away;
this was no way to begin anew. That breath caught in her throat, and she turned her head back to Siuan
so quickly it seemed she had been shaking it. She hoped it did. Just for an instant, there had been a
face in a window across the street. And there was a flutter in her belly, a bubble of fear, a burn of
anger at being afraid. “I think we should go back now,” she said quietly.
“Go back! You said that vile concoction would put me to sleep for a good two hours, and we
haven’t been here much more than half that.”
“Time works differently here.” Had it been Moghedien? The face had vanished so quickly it
could have been someone dreaming herself here for an instant. If it was Moghedien, they must not—
must not on any account—let her know she had been seen. They had to get away. Bubble of fear, burn
of anger. “I told you. A day in Tel’aran’rhiod can be an hour in the waking world, or the other way

round. We—”
“I’ve dipped better out of the bilge in a bucket, girl. You needn’t think you can get away with
shortchanging me. You’ll teach me everything you teach the others, as agreed. We can go when I wake
up.”
There was no time. If it had been Moghedien. Siuan’s dress was green silk now, and the
Amyrlin’s stole and her Great Serpent ring were back, but for a wonder the neckline was almost as
low as anything she had worn before. The ring ter’angreal hung above her breasts, somehow part of
a necklace of square emeralds.
Nynaeve moved without thinking. Her hand lashed out, snatched the necklace so hard it tore free
from Siuan’s neck. Siuan’s eyes widened, but as soon as the clasp broke, she vanished, and necklace
and ring melted from Nynaeve’s hand. For an instant she stared at her empty fingers. What happened
to someone sent out of Tel’aran’rhiod like that? Had she sent Siuan back to her sleeping body? Or to
somewhere else? To nowhere?
Panic seized her. She was just standing there. Quick as thought she fled, the World of Dreams
seeming to change around her.
She stood on a dirt street in a small village of wooden houses, none more than a single story.
The White Lion of Andor waved from a tall staff, and a single stone dock stuck out into a broad river
where a flock of long-billed birds flapped south low over the water. It all looked vaguely familiar,
but it took her a moment to know where she was. Jurene. In Cairhien. And that river was the Erinin. It
had been here that she and Egwene and Elayne had boarded the Darter, as badly misnamed as the
Riverserpent, to continue their journey to Tear. That time seemed like something read in a book long
ago.
Why had she jumped to Jurene? That was simple, and answered as soon as she thought of it.
Jurene was the one place she knew well enough to leap to in Tel’aran’rhiod that she could be sure
Moghedien did not know. They had been there for an hour, before Moghedien knew she existed, and
she was sure neither she nor Elayne had ever mentioned it again, in Tel’aran’rhiod or awake.
But that left another question. The same one, in a way. Why Jurene? Why not step out of the
Dream, wake up in her own bed, such as it was, if washing dishes and scrubbing floors on top of
everything had not left her so weary she slept right on? I can still step out. Moghedien had seen her in
Salidar, if that had been Moghedien. Moghedien knew Salidar now. I can tell Sheriam. How? Admit
she was teaching Siuan? She was not supposed to have her hands on those ter’angreal except with
Sheriam and the other Aes Sedai. How Siuan got hold of them when she wanted, Nynaeve did not
know. No, she was not afraid of more hours up to her elbows in hot water. She was afraid of
Moghedien. Anger burned in her belly fiercely. She wished she had some goosemint out of her scrip
of herbs. I am so . . . so bloody tired of being afraid.
There was a bench in front of one of the houses, overlooking dock and river. She sat down and
considered her situation from every angle. It was ridiculous. The True Source was a pale thing. She
channeled a flame dancing in air above her hand. She might look solid—to herself, anyway—but she
could see the river through that scrap of fire. She tied it off, and it faded away like mist as soon as the
knot was done. How could she face Moghedien when the weakest novice in Salidar could match or
better her strength? That was why she had fled here instead of leaving Tel’aran’rhiod. Afraid and
angry at being afraid, too angry to think straight, to consider her own weakness.
She would step out of the Dream. Whatever Siuan’s scheme had been, it was done; she would
have to take her chances right along with Nynaeve. The thought of more hours scrubbing floors
tightened her hand on her braid. Days more likely, and maybe Sheriam’s switch besides. They might

never let her near one of the dream ter’angreal again, or any ter’angreal. They would set Faolain
over her instead of Theodrin. A finish to studying Siuan and Leane, much less Logain; maybe a finish
to studying Healing.
In a fury she channeled another flame. If it was a whit stronger, she could not see it. So much for
trying to crank her anger in hope it would help. “There’s nothing for it but to just tell them I saw
Moghedien,” she muttered, yanking her braid hard enough to hurt. “Light, they will give me to Faolain.
I’d almost rather die!”
“But you seem to enjoy running little errands for her.”
That mocking voice pulled Nynaeve up off the bench like hands on her shoulders. Moghedien
stood in the street all in black, shaking her head at what she saw. With all her strength Nynaeve wove
a shield of Spirit and hurled it between the other woman and saidar. Tried to hurl it between; it was
like chopping at a tree with a paper hatchet. Moghedien actually smiled before she bothered to slice
Nynaeve’s weave, and that as casually as brushing a biteme away from her face. Nynaeve stared at
her as though poleaxed. After everything it came down to this. The One Power, useless. All the anger
bubbling inside her, useless. All her plans, her hopes, useless. Moghedien did not bother to strike
back. She did not even bother to channel a shield of her own. That was how much contempt she had.
“I was afraid you had seen me. I grew careless when you and Siuan started trying to kill each
other. With your hands.” Moghedien gave a belittling laugh. She was weaving something, lazily
because there was no reason to hurry. Nyaneve did not know what it was, yet she wanted to scream.
Fury seethed inside her, but fear dulled her wits, rooted her feet to the ground. “Sometimes I think you
are all too ignorant even to train, you and the former Amyrlin Seat and all the rest. But I cannot allow
you to betray me.” That weave was reaching out for her. “It is time to collect you at last, it seems.”
“Hold, Moghedien!” Birgitte shouted.
Nynaeve’s mouth dropped open. It was Birgitte, as she had been, in her short white coat and
wide yellow trousers, intricate golden braid pulled over her shoulder, silver arrow drawn on silver
bow. It was impossible. Birgitte was no longer part of Tel’aran’rhiod, she was back in Salidar,
making sure no one discovered Nynaeve and Siuan asleep with the sun up and began asking questions.
Moghedien was so shocked, the flows she had woven vanished. Shock lasted less than a
moment, though. The gleaming arrow flew from Birgitte’s bow—and evaporated. The bow
evaporated. Something seemed to seize the archer, jerking her arms straight up, pulling her clear of
the ground. Almost immediately she was snubbed short, pulled tight between wrists and ankles a foot
above the ground.
“I should have considered the possibility of you.” Moghedien turned her back on Nynaeve to
move closer to Birgitte. “Do you enjoy your flesh? Without Gaidal Cain?”
Nynaeve thought of channeling. But what? A dagger that might not even penetrate the woman’s
skin? Fire that would not singe her skirts? Moghedien knew how useless she was; she was not even
looking at her. If she stopped the flow of Spirit to the sleeping woman in amber, she would wake in
Salidar, she could give warning. Her face twisted near to tears as she looked at Birgitte. The goldenhaired woman hung there, staring defiantly at Moghedien. Moghedien contemplated her in return as a
woodcarver would a block of wood.
There’s only me, Nynaeve thought. I might as well not be able to channel at all. There’s only
me.
Lifting that first foot was like pulling it out of knee-deep mud, the second staggering step no
easier. Toward Moghedien. “Don’t hurt me,” Nynaeve cried. “Please. Don’t hurt me.” A chill ran
through her. Birgitte was gone. A child of perhaps three or four, in short white coat and wide yellow

trousers, stood there playing with a toy-sized silver bow. Flipping her golden braid back, the child
aimed the bow at Nynaeve and giggled, then stuck a finger in her mouth as though unsure whether she
had done something wrong. Nynaeve sagged to her knees. It was hard work crawling in skirts, but she
did not think she could have remained standing. Somehow she managed, reaching out a pleading hand
and whimpering. “Please. Don’t hurt me. Please. Don’t hurt me.” Over and over as she dragged
toward the Forsaken, a broken beetle scrabbling in the dirt.
Moghedien watched silently, until at last she said, “Once I thought you were stronger than this.
Now I find I truly like the sight of you on your knees. That is close enough, girl. Not that I think you
have courage enough to try tearing my hair out. . . .” She seemed amused by the notion.
Nynaeve’s hand wavered a span from Moghedien. It had to be close enough. There was only her.
A nd Tel’aran’rhiod. The image formed in her head, and there it was, silver bracelet on her
outstretched wrist, silver leash linking it to the silver collar around Moghedien’s neck. It was not just
the a’dam she fixed in her head, but Moghedien wearing it, Moghedien and the a’dam, a part of
Tel’aran’rhiod that she held in the form she wanted. She knew something of what to expect; she had
worn an a’dam’s bracelet briefly once, in Falme. In a strange way she was aware of Moghedien in
the same way she was aware of her own body, her own emotions, two sets, each distinct, but each in
her own head. One thing she had only hoped, because Elayne insisted it was so. The thing was indeed
a link; she could feel the Source through the other woman.
Moghedien’s hand leaped to the collar, shock rounding her eyes. Rage and horror. Rage more
than horror, at first. Nynaeve felt them almost as if they were her own. Moghedien had to know what
the leash-and-collar was, yet she tried to channel anyway; at the same time Nynaeve felt a slight
shifting in herself, in the a’dam, as the other woman tried to bend Tel’aran’rhiod to herself.
Suppressing Moghedien’s attempt was simple; the a’dam was a link, with her in control. Knowing
that made it easy. Nynaeve did not want to channel those flows, so they were not channeled.
Moghedien might as well have tried to pick up a mountain with her bare hands. Horror overwhelmed
rage.
Getting to her feet, Nynaeve fastened the proper image in her mind. She did not just imagine
Moghedien leashed in the a’dam, she knew Moghedien was leashed, as firmly as she knew her own
name. The sense of shifting, of her skin trying to crawl, did not go away, though. “Stop that,” she said
sharply. The a’dam did not move, but it seemed to tremble unseen. She thought of blackwasp nettles
lightly brushing the other woman from shoulders to knees. Moghedien shuddered, exhaled
convulsively. “Stop it, I said, or I’ll do worse.” The shifting ceased. Moghedien watched her warily,
still clutching the silver collar around her neck and with an air of being poised on her toes for flight.
Birgitte—the child who was, or had been, Birgitte—stood eyeing them curiously. Nynaeve
formed the image of her as a grown woman, concentrated. The little girl put her finger back in her
mouth and began studying the toy bow. Nynaeve breathed angrily. It was hard changing what someone
else was already maintaining. And on top of that, Moghedien had claimed she could make changes
permanent. But what she could do, she could undo. “Restore her.”
“If you release me, I—”
Nynaeve thought of nettles again, and not a light brush this time. Moghedien sucked air through
clenched teeth, shook like a bedsheet in a high wind.
“That,” Birgitte said, “was the most frightening thing that has ever happened to me.” Herself
once more, she wore the short coat and wide trousers, but she had no bow or quiver. “I was a child,
but at the same time, what was me—really me—was just some fancy floating in the back of that
child’s mind. And I knew it. I knew I was just going to watch what happened and play. . . .” Flipping

her golden braid back over her shoulder, she gave Moghedien a hard look.
“How did you get here?” Nynaeve asked. “I am grateful, you understand, but . . . how?”
Birgitte gave Moghedien a final stony stare, then opened her coat to fish in the neck of her
blouse, pulling up the twisted stone ring on a leather thong. “Siuan woke up. Just for a moment, and
not all the way. Long enough to grumble about you snatching this from her. When you didn’t wake
right behind her, I knew something must be wrong, so I took the ring and the last of what you mixed
for Siuan.”
“There was hardly any left. Only the dregs.”
“Enough to put me to sleep. It tastes horrible, by the way. After that, it was as easy as finding
feather-dancers in Shiota. In some ways this is almost as if I were still—” Birgitte cut off with
another glare for Moghedien. The silver bow reappeared in her hand, and a quiver of silver arrows at
her hip, yet after one moment they vanished again. “Past is past, and the future is ahead,” she said
firmly. “I was not truly surprised to realize there were two of you who knew they were in
Tel’aran’rhiod. I knew the other must be her, and when I arrived and saw the pair of you . . . It
seemed as if she had already captured you, but I hoped that if I distracted her, you might come up with
something.”
Nynaeve felt a stab of shame. She had considered abandoning Birgitte. That was what she had
almost come up with. The thought had only been there for a moment, rejected as soon as it came, but it
had come. What a coward she was. Surely Birgitte never even had moments when fear almost took
control of her. “I . . .” A faint taste of boiled catfern and powdered mavinsleaf. “I almost ran away,”
she said faintly. “I was so frightened my tongue stuck to the roof of my mouth. I almost ran away and
left you.”
“Oh?” Nynaeve writhed inside as Birgitte considered her. “But you did not, did you? I should
have loosed before I called out, but I’ve never felt comfortable shooting anyone from behind. Even
her. Still, it all worked out. But what do we do with her now?”
Moghedien certainly seemed to have overcome her fear. Ignoring the silver collar around her
throat, she watched Nynaeve and Birgitte as though they were the prisoners, not she, and she was
deliberating what to do with them. Except for an occasional twitch of her hands, as if she wanted to
scratch where her skin held the memory of nettles, she appeared black-clad serenity. Only the a’dam
let Nynaeve know there was fear in the woman, almost a gibbering, but pushed down to a muted buzz.
She wished the thing let her know what Moghedien was thinking as well as feeling. Then again, she
was just as glad not to be inside the mind behind those cold dark eyes.
“Before you consider anything . . . drastic,” Moghedien said, “remember that I know much that
would be useful to you. I have observed the other Chosen, peeked into their schemes. Is that not worth
something?”
“Tell me, and I will consider whether it’s worth anything,” Nynaeve said. What could she do
with the woman?
“Lanfear, Graendal, Rahvin and Sammael are plotting together.”
Nynaeve gave the leash a short tug, staggering her. “I know that. Tell me something new.” The
woman was captive here, but the a’dam only existed so long as they were in Tel’aran’rhiod.
“Do you know they are drawing Rand al’Thor to attack Sammael? But when he does, he will
find the others as well, waiting to trap him between them. At least, he will find Graendal and Rahvin.
I think Lanfear plays another game, one the others know nothing about.”
Nynaeve exchanged worried glances with Birgitte. Rand must learn of this. He would, as soon
as she and Elayne could speak to Egwene tonight. If they could manage to put their hands on the

ter’angreal long enough.
“That is,” Moghedien murmured, “if he lives long enough to find them.”
Nynaeve took hold of the silvery leash where it joined the collar and pulled the Forsaken’s face
close to hers. Dark eyes met her gaze flatly, but she could feel anger through the a’dam, and fear
wriggling up and being stamped down. “You listen to me. Do you think I don’t know why you are
pretending to be so cooperative? You think if you keep talking long enough, I will make some slip,
and you can escape. You think the longer we talk, the harder I’ll find it to kill you.” That much was
true enough. To kill somebody in cold blood, even one of the Forsaken, would be hard, maybe harder
than she could manage. What was she going to do with the woman? “But you understand this. I won’t
allow hinting at things. If you try keeping anything back from me, I will do to you everything you ever
thought of doing to me.” Dread, creeping through the leash, like bone-chilling shrieks deep in
Moghedien’s mind. Maybe she did not know as much about a’dam as Nynaeve thought. Maybe she
believed Nynaeve could read her thoughts if she tried. “Now if you know of some threat to Rand,
something ahead of Sammael and the others, you tell me. Now!”
Words spilled from Moghedien’s mouth, and her tongue flickered out to wet her lips continually.
“Al’Thor means to go after Rahvin. Today. This morning. Because he thinks Rahvin killed Morgase. I
don’t know whether he did or not, but al’Thor believes it. But Rahvin never trusted Lanfear. He never
trusted any of them. Why should he? He thought it all might be some trap set for him, so he has laid a
trap of his own. He has set Wards through Caemlyn so if a man channels a spark he will know.
Al’Thor will walk right into it. He almost certainly already has. I think he meant to leave Cairhien
right after sunrise. I had no part of it. It was none of it my doing. I—”
Nynaeve wanted to shut her up; the fear sweat glistening on the woman’s face made her sick, but
if she had to listen to that pleading voice, too . . . She started to channel, wondering whether she
would be strong enough to hold Moghedien’s tongue, then smiled. She was linked to Moghedien, and
in control. Moghedien’s eyes bulged as she wove flows to stop her own mouth and tied them.
Nynaeve added plugs for her ears, too, before turning to Birgitte. “What do you think?”
“Elayne’s heart will break. She loves her mother.”
“I know that!” Nynaeve took a breath. “I will cry with her and mean every tear, but right now I
must worry about Rand. I think she was telling the truth. I could almost feel it.” She caught the silver
leash just below her bracelet and shook it. “Maybe it’s this, and maybe it was imagination. What do
you believe?”
“That it’s the truth. She was never very brave unless she clearly had the upper hand, or thought
she could get it. And you certainly put the fear of the Light into her.”
Nynaeve grimaced. Birgitte’s every word put another bubble of anger in her belly. She was
never very brave except when she clearly had the upper hand. That could describe herself. She had
put the fear of the Light into Moghedien. She had, and she had meant every word when she said it.
Boxing somebody’s ears when they needed it was one thing; threatening torture, wanting to torture,
even Moghedien, was something else again. And here she was trying to avoid what she knew she had
to do. Never very brave except when she clearly had the upper hand. This time the bubble of anger
was seeded by herself. “We have to go to Caemlyn. I do, at least. With her. I may not be able to
channel strongly enough to tear paper as I am, but with the a’dam I can use her strength.”
“You won’t be able to affect anything in the waking world from Tel’aran’rhiod,” Birgitte said
quietly.
“I know! I know, but I have to do something.”
Birgitte threw back her head and laughed. “Oh, Nynaeve, it is such an embarrassment being

associated with such a coward as you.” Abruptly her eyes widened in surprise. “There wasn’t much
of your potion left. I think I am wak—” In mid-word, she was simply no longer there.
Taking a deep breath, Nynaeve untied the flows around Moghedien. Or made her do it; with the
a’dam it was hard to tell which, really. She wished Birgitte was still there. Another pair of eyes.
Someone who probably knew Tel’aran’rhiod better than she ever could. Someone who was brave.
“We are taking a trip, Moghedien, and you are going to help me with every last scrap of you. If
anything takes me by surprise . . . Suffice it to say, anything that happens to the one wearing this
bracelet happens to the one wearing the collar. Only about tenfold.” The sickly look on Moghedien’s
face said she believed. Which was just as well, since it was true.
Another deep breath, and Nynaeve began forming the image of the one place in Caemlyn she
knew well enough to remember. The Royal Palace, where Elayne had taken her. Rahvin must be
there. But in the waking world, not the World of Dreams. Still, she had to do something.
Tel’aran’rhiod changed around her.

CHAPTER
55

The Threads Burn

Rand stopped. A long scorch along the corridor wall marked where half a dozen costly
tapestries had gone to ash. Flames licked upward on another; a number of inlaid chests and tables
were only charred ruins. Not his work. Thirty paces further on, red-coated men in breastplates and
helmets with barred face-guards lay contorted in death on the white floor tiles, useless swords in
hands. Not his work either. Rahvin had been wasteful of his own in attempting to reach Rand. He had
been clever in his attacks, clever in his escapes, but from the moment he fled the throne room he had
not faced Rand for more than the instant it took to strike and flee. Rahvin was strong, perhaps as
strong as Rand, and more knowledgeable, but Rand had the fat-little-man angreal in his pocket, and
Rahvin had none.
The corridor was doubly familiar, once for having seen it before, once for having seen
something similar.
I walked this way with Elayne and Gawyn the day I met Morgase. The thought slithered
painfully along the boundaries of the Void. He was cold in there, without emotion. Saidin raged and
burned, but he was icy calm.
And another thought, like a stab. She lay on a floor like this, her golden hair spread as though
sleeping. Ilyena Sunhair. My Ilyena.
Elaida had been there that day, too. She Foretold the pain I’d bring. She knew the darkness in
me. Some of it. Enough.
Ilyena, I did not know what I was doing. I was mad! I am mad. Oh, Ilyena!
Elaida knew—some—but she did not tell even all of that. Better if she had told.
Oh, Light, is there no forgiveness? I did what I did in madness. Is there no mercy?
Gareth Bryne would have killed me, had he known. Morgase would have ordered my death.
Morgase would be alive, perhaps. Elayne’s mother alive. Aviendha alive. Mat. Moiraine. How
many alive, if I had died?
I have earned my torment. I deserve the final death. Oh, Ilyena, I deserve death.
I deserve death.
Bootsteps behind him. He turned.
They came out of a broad crossing corridor not twenty paces from him, two dozen men in
breastplates and helmets and the white-collared red coats of the Queen’s Guards. Except that Andor
had no queen now, and these men had not served her while she lived. A Myrddraal led them, pale
eyeless face like something found under a rock, overlapping plates of black armor heightening the
illusion of a serpent as it moved, black cloak hanging motionless however it moved. The look of the
Eyeless was fear, but fear was a distant thing in the Void. They hesitated when they saw him; then the

Halfman raised its black-bladed sword. Men who had not already drawn put hands to hilts.
Rand—he thought that was his name—channeled in a way he could not remember doing before.
Men and Myrddraal stiffened where they stood. White frost grew thick on them, frost that
smoked as Mat’s boots had smoked. The Myrddraal’s upraised arm broke off with a loud crack.
When it hit the floor tiles, arm and sword shattered.
Rand could feel the cold—yes, that was his name; Rand—cold like a knife as he walked past
and turned the way they had come. Cold, yet warmer than saidin.
A man and a woman crouched against the wall, servants liveried in red and white, short of their
middle years and holding each other as though for protection. Seeing Rand—there was more to the
name; not just Rand—the man started to rise from where he had huddled away from the Myrddraalled band, but the woman hauled him back by his sleeve.
“Go in peace,” Rand said, putting out a hand. Al’Thor. Yes, Rand al’Thor. “I’ll not hurt you, but
you could be hurt if you stay.”
The woman’s brown eyes rolled up in her head. She would have collapsed in a heap if the man
had not caught her, and his narrow mouth was working rapidly, as if he was praying but could not get
the words out.
Rand looked where the man was looking. His hand had stretched out of his coatsleeve far enough
to bare the Dragon’s golden-maned head that was part of his skin. “I will not hurt you,” he said, and
walked on, leaving them there. He had Rahvin to corner yet. Rahvin to kill. And then?
No sound but the click of his boots on the tiles. And deep in his head, a faint voice murmuring
mournfully of Ilyena and forgiveness. He strained to feel Rahvin channeling, to feel the man filled
with the True Source. Nothing. Saidin seared his bones, froze his flesh, scoured his soul, but from
without it was not easy to see until you were close. A lion in high grass, Asmodean had said once. A
rabid lion. Should Asmodean count among those who should not have died? Or Lanfear? No. Not—
He had only a moment’s warning to throw himself flat, a hair-thin slice of time between feeling
flows suddenly woven and an arm-thick bar of white light, liquid fire, slicing through the wall,
ripping across like a sword through where his chest had been. Where that bar slashed, on both sides
of the hallways, wall and friezes, doors and tapestries ceased to exist. Severed wall hangings and
chunks of stone and plaster broken free rained to the floor.
So much for the Forsaken fearing to use balefire. Who had told him that? Moiraine. She surely
had deserved to live.
Balefire leaped from his hands, a brilliant white shaft streaking toward where that other bar had
originated. The other failed even as his punched through the wall, leaving a purple afterimage fanning
across his vision. He released his own flow. Had he done it finally?
Scrambling to his feet, he channeled Air, slamming ruined doors open so hard that the remnants
ripped from the hinges. Inside, the room was empty. A sitting room, with chairs arrayed before a great
marble fireplace. His balefire had taken a bite out of one of the arches leading to a small courtyard
with a fountain, and another from one of the fluted columns along the walk beyond.
Rahvin had not gone that way, though, and he had not died in that blast of balefire. A residue
hung in the air, a fading remnant of woven saidin. Rand recognized it. Different from the gateway he
had made to Skim to Caemlyn, or the one to Travel—he knew now that was what he had done—into
the throne room. But he had seen one like this in Tear, had made one himself.
He wove another now. A gateway, an opening at least, a hole in reality. It was not blackness on
the other side. In fact, if he had not known the way was there, if he could not have seen the weave of
it, he might not have known. There before him were the same arches opening onto the same courtyard

and fountain, the same columned walk. For an instant the neatly rounded holes his balefire had made
in arch and column wavered, filled, then were holes again. Wherever that gateway led, it was to
somewhere else, a reflection of the Royal Palace as once it had been a reflection of the Stone of Tear.
Vaguely he regretted not talking to Asmodean about it while he had the chance, but he had never been
able to speak of that day to anyone. It did not matter. On that day he had carried Callandor, but the
angreal in his pocket had already proved enough to harry Rahvin.
Stepping through quickly, he loosed the weave and hurried away across the courtyard as the
gateway vanished. Rahvin would have felt that gate if he was close enough and trying. The fat little
stone man did not mean he could stand and wait to be attacked.
No sign of life, except for himself and one fly. That was the way it had been in Tear, too. Standlamps in the hallways stood unlit, with pale wicks that had never seen a flame, yet even in what
should have been the dimmest hall there was light, seemingly coming from everywhere and nowhere.
Sometimes those lamps moved, too, and other things as well. Between one glance and the next, a tall
lamp might have moved a foot, a vase in a niche an inch. Little things, as if someone had shifted them
in the time his eyes were away. Wherever this was, it was a strange place.
It came to him, as he trotted along another colonnade, sensing for Rahvin, that he had not heard
the voice crying over Ilyena since he channeled balefire. Perhaps he had somehow chased Lews
Therin out of his head.
Good. He stopped at the edge of one of the Palace gardens. The roses and whitestar bushes
looked as drought-bedraggled as they would have in the real palace. On some of the white spires
rising above the rooftops, the White Lion banner rippled, but which spire could change in the blink of
an eye. Good, if I don’t have to share my head with—
He felt odd. Insubstantial. He raised his arm, and stared. He could see the garden through
coatsleeve and arm as through a mist. A mist that was thinning. When he glanced down, he could see
the walk’s paving stones through himself.
No! It was not his thought. An image began to coalesce. A tall, dark-eyed man with a worrycreased face and more white in his hair than brown. I am Lews Ther—
I am Rand al’Thor, Rand broke in. He did not know what was happening, but the faint Dragon
was beginning to fade from the misty arm held in front of his face. The arm began to look darker, the
fingers on his hand longer. I am me. That echoed in the Void. I am Rand al’Thor.
He fought to picture himself in his own mind, struggled to make the image of what he saw in the
mirror every day shaving, what he saw in a stand-mirror dressing. It was a frantic fight. He had never
really looked at himself. The two images waxed and waned, the older dark-eyed man and the younger
with blue-gray eyes. Slowly the younger image firmed, the older faded. Slowly his arm grew more
solid. His arm, with the Dragon twined around it and the heron branded into his palm. There had been
times he hated those marks, but now, even enclosed within the emotionless Void, he almost grinned to
see them.
Why had Lews Therin tried to take him over? To make him into Lews Therin. He was sure that
was who that dark-eyed man with the suffering face had been. Why now? Because he could in this
place, whatever it was? Wait. It had been Lews Therin who shouted that adamant “no.” Not an attack
by Lews Therin. By Rahvin, and not using the Power. If the man had been able to do this back in
Caemlyn, the real Caemlyn, he would have. It had to be some ability he had gained here. And if
Rahvin had gained it, perhaps he had, too. The image of himself had been what held him, brought him
back.
He focused on the nearest rosebush, a thing a span high, and imagined it growing thin, foggy.

Obediently, it melted away to nothing, but as soon as the picture in his mind was nothing, the rosebush
was suddenly back, just as it had been.
Rand nodded coldly. It had limits, then. There were always limits and rules, and he did not know
them here. But he knew the Power, as much as Asmodean had taught him and he had taught himself,
and saidin was still in him, all the sweetness of life, all the corruption of death. Rahvin had to have
seen him to attack. With the Power you had to see something to affect it, or know exactly where it
was in relation to you down to a hair. Perhaps it was different here, but he did not think so. He almost
wished Lews Therin had not gone silent again. The man might know this place and its rules.
Balconies and windows overlooked the garden, in some places four stories high. Rahvin had
tried to . . . unmake him. He drew on the raging torrent of saidin through the angreal. Lightnings
flashed from the sky, a hundred forking silver bolts, more, stabbing at every window, every balcony.
Thunder filled the garden, erupting chunks of stone. The air itself crackled, and the hair on his arms
and chest tried to stand under his shirt. Even the hair on his head began to lift. He let the lightnings
die. Here and there bits of shattered stone windowframe and balcony broke loose, the crash of their
fall muted by the echoes of thunder still ringing in his ears.
Gaping holes peered down now where windows had. They looked like sockets in some
monstrous skull, the ruined balconies like a dozen splintered mouths. If Rahvin had been at any of
them, he was surely dead. Rand would not believe it until he saw the corpse. He wanted to see
Rahvin dead.
Wearing a snarl he did not know was there, he stalked back into the palace. He had wanted to
see Rahvin die.
Nynaeve hurled herself flat and scrambled along the hall floor as something slashed through the
nearest wall. Moghedien slithered as fast as she, but if the woman had not, she would have hauled her
by the a’dam. Had that been Rand, or Rahvin? She had seen bars of white fire, liquid light, like that in
Tanchico, and she had no wish to be anywhere near one again. Balefire was one weave she did not
know and did not want to know. I want to Heal, burn both of these fool men, not learn a fancy way
to kill!
She levered herself up to a crouch, peered back the way they had come. Nothing. An empty
Palace hallway. With a ten-foot long gash through both walls, as neat as any stoneworker could have
done, and bits of tapestry lying on the floor. No sign of either man. She had not had a glimpse of either
so far. Only their handiwork. Sometimes that handiwork had almost been her. A good thing that she
could draw on Moghedien’s anger, filter it out of the terror clawing to escape and let it seep into her.
Her own was a pitiful thing that would scarcely have allowed her to sense the True Source, much less
channel the flow of Spirit that kept her in Tel’aran’rhiod.
Moghedien was hunched over on her knees, dry retching. Nynaeve’s mouth tightened. The
woman had tried to remove the a’dam again. Her cooperation had faded quickly when they
discovered Rand and Rahvin actually here in Tel’aran’rhiod. Well, trying to unfasten that collar
when it was around your neck was its own punishment. At least Moghedien did not have anything left
in her stomach this time.
“Please.” Moghedien caught at Nynaeve’s skirt. “I tell you, we must get away.” Stark panic
made her voice painful. Moghedien’s clawing terror mirrored itself on her face. “They are here in the
flesh. The flesh!”
“Be quiet,” Nynaeve said absently. “Unless you’ve lied to me, that is an advantage. For me.”
The other woman claimed that being in the World of Dreams physically limited your control of the

Dream. Or rather, she admitted it, after letting a bit of the knowledge slip. She had admitted, too, that
Rahvin did not know Tel’aran’rhiod as well as she. Nynaeve hoped that meant he did not know it as
well as she did. That he knew more than Rand, she did not doubt. That wool-headed man! Whatever
his reason for coming after Rahvin, he should never have let the man lead him here, where he did not
know the rules, where thoughts could kill.
“Why will you not understand what I tell you? Even if they had only dreamed themselves here,
either would be stronger than we. Here in the flesh, they could crush us without blinking. In the flesh
they can draw saidin more deeply than we can draw saidar dreaming.”
“We are linked.” Still not paying attention, Nynaeve gave her braid a sharp pull. No way to tell
which direction they had gone. And no warning of anything until she saw them. Somehow it still
seemed unfair that they could channel without her being able to see or feel the flows. A stand-lamp
that had been sliced in two was suddenly whole again, then not, just as quickly. That white fire must
be incredibly powerful. Tel’aran’rhiod usually healed itself rapidly whatever you did to it.
“You brainless fool,” Moghedien sobbed, shaking Nynaeve’s skirt with both hands as if wanting
to shake Nynaeve. “It does not matter how brave you are. We are linked, but you contribute nothing
the way you are. Not a shred. It is my strength, and your madness. They are here in the flesh, not
dreaming! They are using things you have never dreamed of! They will destroy us if we stay!”
“Keep your voice down,” Nynaeve snapped. “Do you want to bring one of them down on us?”
She looked both ways hurriedly, but the hallway was still empty. Had that been footsteps, boots?
Rand or Rahvin? One had to be approached as carefully as the other. A man in a fight for his life
could strike out before he saw they were friends. Well, that she was, anyway.
“We must go,” Moghedien insisted, but she did lower her voice. She got to her feet, sullen
defiance twisting her mouth. Fear and anger writhed inside her, first one stronger, then the other.
“Why should I help you any further? This is madness!”
“Would you rather feel the nettles again?”
Moghedien flinched, yet her dark eyes remained stubborn. “You think I will let them kill me
rather than be hurt by you? You are mad. I will not stir from this spot until you are ready to take us
away from here.”
Nynaeve jerked her braid again. If Moghedien refused to walk, she would have to drag her. Not
a very quick way to search, with what seemed miles of Palace corridors yet to go. She should have
been harsher when the woman first tried balking. In Nynaeve’s place, Moghedien would have killed
without hesitation, or, if she thought the other useful, woven the trick of taking someone’s will,
making them worship her. Nynaeve had tasted that once, in Tanchico, and even had she known how it
was done, she did not think she could do it to somebody else. She despised this woman, hated her
with all her being. But even if she had not needed her, she could not have killed her just standing
there. The trouble was, she was afraid that Moghedien knew that, too, now.
Still, a Wisdom headed the Women’s Circle—even if the Circle did not always agree—and the
Women’s Circle dealt out punishments to women who broke the law or offended custom too deeply,
and to men, too, for some transgressions. She might not have Moghedien’s stomach for killing, for
crushing people’s minds, but. . . .
Moghedien opened her mouth, and Nynaeve filled it with a gag of Air. Or rather she made
Moghedien do it; with the a’dam linking them, it was like channeling herself, but Moghedien knew it
was her own abilities being used like a tool in Nynaeve’s hand. Dark eyes glittered indignantly as
Moghedien’s own flows snared her arms to her sides and pulled her skirts tight around her ankles.
For the rest, Nynaeve used the a’dam, just as with the nettles, creating the sensations she wanted the

other woman to feel. Not the reality; the feel of reality.
Moghedien stiffened in her bonds as a leather strap seemed to strike her bottom. That was what
it would feel like to her. Outrage and humiliation rolled through the leash. And contempt. Compared
to her elaborate ways of hurting people, this seemed suitable for a child.
“When you are ready to cooperate again,” Nynaeve said, “just nod.” This could not take long.
She could not just stand there while Rand and Rahvin tried to kill one another. If the wrong one died
because she avoided danger by letting Moghedien keep her there . . .
Nynaeve remembered a day when she was sixteen, just after she had been judged old enough to
put her hair in a braid. She had stolen a plum pudding from Corin Ayellin on a dare from Nela Thane
and walked out the kitchen door right into Mistress Ayellin. Adding the aftermath, sending it along the
leash in a lump, made Moghedien’s eyes pop.
Grimly, Nynaeve did it again. She won’t stop me short! Again. I will help Rand whatever she
thinks! Again. Even if it kills us! Again. Oh, Light, she could be right; Rand could kill us both
before he knows it’s me . Again. Light, I hate being afraid! Again. I hate her! Again. I hate her!
Again.
Abruptly she realized Moghedien was jerking frantically in her bonds, nodding her head so
violently it seemed about to come off. For a moment, Nynaeve gaped at the other woman’s tearstreaked face, then stopped what she was doing and hurriedly unraveled the flows of Air. Light, what
had she done? She was not Moghedien. “I take it you won’t give me any more trouble?”
“They will kill us,” the other woman mumbled faintly, and nearly unintelligibly through her sobs,
but at the same time she nodded a hurried acquiescence.
Deliberately, Nynaeve hardened herself. Moghedien deserved everything she had gotten and
much, much more. In the Tower, one of the Forsaken would have been stilled and executed as soon as
the trial could be concluded, and little evidence needed beside who she was. “Good. Now we—”
Thunder shook the entire Palace, or something very much like thunder, except that the walls
rattled and dust rose off the floor. Nynaeve half fell into Moghedien, and they danced trying to keep
their feet. Before the upheaval had faded completely, it was replaced by a roar like some monstrous
fire racing up a chimney the size of a mountain. That lasted only a moment. The silence after seemed
deeper than before. No. There were boots. A man running. The sound echoed down the hallway. From
the north.
Nynaeve pushed the other woman away. “Come on.”
Moghedien whimpered, but did not resist being pulled down the hall. Her eyes were huge,
though, and her breath came too fast. Nynaeve thought it was a good thing she had Moghedien along,
and not just for access to the One Power. After all her years hiding in shadows, the Spider was such a
coward she almost made Nynaeve feel brave by comparison. Almost. It was only anger at her own
fear that made her able to hold on to that one flow of Spirit that kept her in Tel’aran’rhiod, now.
Moghedien was stark terror to her bones.
Pulling Moghedien behind her by the gleaming leash, Nynaeve quickened her step. Chasing the
fading sound of those other steps.
Rand stepped into the round courtyard warily. Half of the white-paved circle cut into the
structure rising three stories behind him; the other half was bounded by a stone semicircle atop pale
columns five paces high, sticking out into yet another garden, shaded gravel walks beneath low
spreading trees. Marble benches surrounded a pool with lilypads. And fish, gold and white and red.
Suddenly the benches shifted, flowed, changed into faceless manshapes, still as white and hard-

looking as the stone. He had already learned the difficulty of changing something that Rahvin had
altered. Lightning danced from his fingertips, shattering stone men to shards.
The air became water. Choking, Rand struggled to swim toward the columns; he could see the
garden beyond. There must be some kind of barrier to stop all the water pouring out. Before he could
channel, gold and red and white shapes were darting around him, larger than the fish in the pool had
been. And with teeth. They ripped at him; blood curled up in red mist. Instinctively he flailed at the
fish with his hands, but the cold part of him, deep in the Void, channeled. Balefire flared, at the
barrier if there was one, at any place Rahvin might be to see this courtyard. The water roiled,
throwing him around violently, as it rushed in to fill the empty tunnels carved by balefire. Flickers of
gold and white and red darted at him, adding new threads of crimson to the water. Tossed about, he
could not see to aim his wild bolts; they flashed in every direction. No breath left. He tried to think of
air, or the water being air.
Suddenly it was. He dropped hard to the paving stones among small fish flopping about, rolled
over and pushed himself up. It was all air again; even his clothes were dry. The stone ring flickered
between standing untouched and lying in ruins with half the columns down. Some of the trees lay
tangled atop their own stumps, then stood whole, then were fallen again. The Palace behind him had
holes punched in white walls, even one through a high gilded dome above, and gashes slashed across
windows, some with pierce-work stone screens. The damage all flickered, vanishing and
reappearing. Not the slow, sometime shifts of before, but constant. Damage, then none, then some,
then none, then all again.
Wincing, he pressed his hand to his side, to the old, half-healed wound. It stung as if his
exertions had nearly torn it open. He stung all over, from a dozen or more bleeding bites. That had not
changed. The bloody rips in his coat and breeches were still there. Had he managed to change the
water back to air? Or had one of his frenzied bolts of balefire driven Rahvin off, or even killed him?
It did not matter, unless it was the last.
Wiping blood out of his eyes, he studied the windows and balconies around the garden, the
colonnade high on the far side. Or rather, he started to, but something else caught his eye. Below the
colonnade, he could just make out the fading remnants of a weave. From there he could tell it was a
gateway, but to see what kind and where it led, he had to be closer. Leaping over a jumble of worked
stone that vanished while he was above it, he darted across the garden, dodging around trees fallen on
the walkway. That residue was almost gone; he had to get close enough before it vanished
completely.
Abruptly he fell, gravel scraping his palms as he caught himself. He could not see anything that
might have tripped him. He felt woozy, almost as if he had been hit on the head. He tried to scramble
to his feet, to reach that residue. And realized his body was writhing. Long hair covered his hands; his
fingers seemed to be shrinking, drawing back into his hands. They were almost paws. A trap. Rahvin
had not fled. The gateway had been a trap, and he had walked into it.
Desperation clung to the Void as he struggled to cling to himself. His hands. They were hands.
Almost hands. He forced himself up. His legs seemed to bend wrong. The True Source receded; the
Void shrank. Streaks of panic flared beyond the emotionless emptiness. Whatever Rahvin was trying
to change him to, it could not channel. Saidin slipping away, thinning, thin even pulled through the
angreal. The surrounding balconies stared down at him, empty, and the colonnade. Rahvin had to be
at one of those stone-screened windows, but which? He had no strength for a hundred lightning bolts
this time. One burst. He could manage that. If he did it quickly. Which window? He fought to be
himself, fought to draw saidin into him, welcomed every stain of the taint as evidence that he still

held the Power. Staggering in a crooked circle, searching vainly, he roared Rahvin’s name. It sounded
like a beast’s roar.
Pulling Moghedien behind her, Nynaeve rounded the corner. Ahead of her, a man vanished
around the next turning, the sound of his boots echoing behind. She did not know how long she had
been following those boots. Sometimes they had gone silent, and she had had to wait for them to start
again to gain a direction. Sometimes when they stopped things happened; she had not seen any of it,
but once the Palace had rung like a struck bell, and another time the hair on her head had tried to stand
up as the air seemed to crackle, and another . . . It did not matter. This was the first time she had
caught a glimpse of the man who wore those boots. She did not think it was Rand in that black coat.
The height was right, but he was too large, too heavy in the chest.
She was running before she knew it. Her stout shoes had long since become velvet slippers for
silence. If she could hear him, he could hear her. Moghedien’s frenzied panting was louder than their
footfalls.
Nynaeve reached the turn and stopped, peeking cautiously around the corner. She held saidar—
through Moghedien, but it was hers—ready to channel. There was no need. The hallway was empty.
A door stood far down a wall with windows filled with arabesque-pierced stone, but she did not
think he could have reached that. Nearer, another corridor ran off to the right. She hurried to that,
looked warily again. Empty. But a staircase spiraled upward just beyond where the hallways met.
For a moment she hesitated. He had been hurrying somewhere. This corridor led back the way
they had come. Would he have been running to go back? Up then.
Drawing Moghedien behind her, she climbed the steps slowly, straining to hear anything except
the Forsaken’s nearly hysterical breath and the blood pounding in her own ears. If she found herself
face to face with him . . . She knew he was there already, somewhere ahead. Surprise had to be on her
side.
At the first landing, she paused. The hallways here mirrored those below. They were just as
empty, too, just as silent. Had he gone on up?
The stair quivered faintly beneath her feet as if the palace had been struck by a huge battering
ram, then another. Again, as a bar of white fire punched through the top of one of the stone-screened
windows, skewed wildly upward at an angle, then winked out as it started to slice into the ceiling.
Nynaeve swallowed, blinking in a vain effort to rid herself of the pale violet fan that hung across
her vision in memory of the thing. That had to be Rand, trying to strike at Rahvin. If she was too close
to him, Rand might catch her by accident. If he was flailing like that—it had had the look of flailing to
her—he could catch her anywhere without knowing it.
The quivers had ceased. Moghedien’s eyes shone with terror. By what Nynaeve felt through the
a’dam, it was a wonder the woman was not writhing on the floor, shrieking and frothing at the mouth.
Nynaeve felt a little like shrieking herself. She made herself put her foot on the next step. Up was as
good a way as any. The second step was almost as hard. Slowly, though. No need to come on him too
suddenly. Surprise had to be on his part. Moghedien followed like a whipped dog, shivering.
As Nynaeve climbed, she embraced saidar as fully as she could, as much as Moghedien could
handle, to the point where the sweetness of it became almost a pain. That was the warning. More, and
she would approach the point where it was more than she could take in, the point where she would
still herself, burn the ability to channel right out of herself. Or perhaps out of Moghedien, under the
circumstances. Or both of them. Any way at all, it would be disaster now. She held that point though,
the . . . life . . . filling her a needle’s light pressure just short of breaking skin. It was as much as she

could have embraced had she been channeling on her own. She and Moghedien were much the same
strength in the Power; Tanchico had proved that. Was it enough? Moghedien insisted the men were
stronger. Rahvin, at least—Moghedien knew him—and it did not seem likely Rand could have
survived this long unless he was just as strong. It was not fair that men should have the muscles and
greater strength in the Power, too. The Aes Sedai in the Tower had always said they had been equal.
It just was not—
She was babbling. Taking a deep breath, she drew Moghedien behind her off the staircase. This
was as high as it went.
This hall was empty. She went to where it met the crossing corridor, peeked. And there he was.
A tall black-clad man, large, with wings of white in his dark hair, peering through the curving slots of
one of the stone window-screens at something below. There was sweat and effort on his face, but he
seemed to be smiling. A handsome face, as handsome as Galad’s, but she felt no quickening of her
breath for this one.
Whatever he was staring at—Rand perhaps?—had his full attention, but Nynaeve gave him no
chance to notice her. It might be Rand down there. She could not tell whether Rahvin was channeling
or not. She filled the corridor around him with fire from wall to wall, floor to ceiling, pouring into it
all of saidar she held, fire so hot the stone itself smoked. The heat made her flinch back.
Rahvin screamed in the middle of the flame—it was one flame—and staggered away from her,
back to where the hallway became a columned walk. A heartbeat, less, while she still flinched, and
he stood, inside the flame but surrounded by clear air. Every scrap of saidar she could channel was
going into that inferno, but he held it at bay. She could see him through the fire; it gave everything a
red cast, but she could see. Smoke rose from his charred coat. His face was a seared ruin, one eye
milky white. But both eyes were malevolent as he turned them on her.
No emotion reached her along the a’dam’s leash, only leaden dullness. Nynaeve’s stomach
fluttered. Moghedien had given up. Given up because death was there for them.

Fire thrust through the carved window-screens above Rand, fingers of it filling every hole,
dancing toward the colonnade. As it did, the struggle within him ceased abruptly. He was himself so
suddenly it was almost a shock. He had been drawing desperately at saidin, trying to hold onto some
of it. Now it rushed into him, an avalanche of fire and ice that made his knees buckle, made the Void
tremble with pain that shaved at it like a lathe.
And Rahvin stumbled backwards out onto the colonnade, face turned to something inside. Rahvin
wreathed in fire, yet somehow standing as though untouched. If untouched now, it had not been so
before. Only the size of the figure, the impossibility of it being anyone else, told Rand it was him. The
Forsaken was a figure of char and cracked red flesh that would have strained any Healer to mend.
The agony of it must have been overwhelming. Except that Rahvin would be inside the Void within
that burned remnant of a man, wrapped in emptiness where the body’s pain was distant and saidin
close at hand.
Saidin raged inside Rand, and he loosed it all. Not to Heal.
“Rahvin!” he screamed, and balefire flew from his hands, molten light thicker than a man, driven
by all the Power he could draw.
It struck the Forsaken, and Rahvin ceased to exist. The Darkhounds in Rhuidean had become
motes before they vanished, whatever kind of life they had had struggling to continue, or the Pattern
struggling to maintain itself even for them. Before this, Rahvin simply . . . ceased.

Rand let the balefire die, pushed saidin away a little. Trying to blink away the purple
afterimage, he stared up at the wide hole in the marble balustrade, the remains of one column a fang
above it, stared at the matching hole in the Palace roof. They did not flicker, as if what he had done
was too strong even for this place to mend. After everything, it seemed almost too easy. Perhaps there
was something up there to convince him Rahvin was really dead. He ran toward a door.
Frantically, Nynaeve threw everything into trying to close the flame tight around Rahvin once
more. The thought came that she should have used lightning. She was going to die. Those horrible
eyes had fixed on Moghedien, not her, but she was going to die, too.
Liquid fire sliced up into the colonnade, so hot it made the fire she had made seem cool. Shock
made her release her weaving, and she flung up a hand to protect her face, yet before it had raised
halfway, the liquid fire was gone. So was Rahvin. She did not believe he had escaped. There had
been an instant, so brief she could almost have imagined it, when that white bar touched him and he
became . . . mist. Just an instant. She could have imagined. But she did not believe so. She drew a
shuddering breath.
Moghedien had her face in her hands, weeping, trembling. The one emotion Nynaeve sensed
through the a’dam was relief so powerful it drowned anything else.
Hurried boots grated on the stairs below.
Nynaeve spun, took a step toward the spiral staircase. She was surprised to realize she was
drinking deeply of saidar, holding herself ready.
That surprise faded when Rand climbed into sight. He was not as she remembered. His features
were the same, but his face was hard. Blue ice made his eyes. The bloody rips in his coat and
breeches, the blood on his face, seemed to suit that face.
The way he looked, she would not be surprised if he killed Moghedien on the spot the instant he
discovered who she was. Nynaeve had uses for her yet. He would recognize an a’dam. Without
another thought she changed it, let the leash vanish, leaving only the silver bracelet on her wrist and
the collar on Moghedien. A moment of panic when she comprehended what she had done, then a sigh
as she realized that she still felt the other woman. It worked exactly as Elayne had said it would.
Perhaps he had not seen. She was between him and Moghedien; the leash had trailed behind her.
He barely glanced at Moghedien. “I thought about those flames, coming up here. I thought it
might have been you or . . . Where is this? Is this where you meet Egwene?”
Looking up at him, Nynaeve tried not to swallow. So cold, that face. “Rand, the Wise Ones say
what you’ve done, what you are doing, is dangerous, even evil. They say you lose something of
yourself if you come here in the flesh, some part of what makes you human.”
“Do the Wise Ones know everything?” He brushed past her and stood staring at the colonnade.
“I used to think Aes Sedai knew everything. It doesn’t matter. I don’t know how human the Dragon
Reborn can afford to be.”
“Rand, I . . .” She did not know what to say. “Here, let me Heal you at least.”
He held still for her to reach up and take his head in her hands. For her part, she had to suppress
a wince. His fresh wounds were not serious, only numerous—what could have bitten him; she was
sure most of these were bites—but the old wound, that half-healed, never-healing wound in his side,
that was a sinkhole of darkness, a well filled with what she thought the taint of saidin must be like.
She channeled the complex flows, Air and Water, Spirit, even Fire and Earth in small amounts, that
made up Healing. He did not roar and flail about. He did not even blink. He shivered. That was all.
Then he took her wrists and brought her hands down from his face. She was not reluctant. His new

injuries were gone, every bite and scrape and bruise, but not the old wound. Nothing had changed
about that. Anything short of death should be capable of being Healed, even that. Anything!
“Is he dead?” he asked quietly. “Did you see him die?”
“He’s dead, Rand. I saw.”
He nodded. “But there are others still, aren’t there? Other . . . Chosen.”
Nynaeve felt a stabbing sliver of fear from Moghedien, but she did not glance back. “Rand, you
must go. Rahvin is dead, and this place is dangerous for you as you are. You must go, and not come
back here in the body.”
“I will go.”
He did nothing that she could see or feel—of course, she could not—but for a moment she
thought the hallway behind him had . . . turned in some way. But it did not look any different. Except
. . . She blinked. There was no half-gone column in the colonnade beyond him, no hole in the stone
railing.
He went on as if nothing had happened. “Tell Elayne. . . . Ask her not to hate me. Ask her . . .”
Pain twisted his face. For a moment she saw the boy she had known, looking as though something
precious was being ripped away from him. She reached out to comfort him, and he stepped back, his
face stone again, and bleak. “Lan was right. Tell Elayne to forget me, Nynaeve. Tell her I’ve found
something else to love, and there’s no room left for her. He wanted me to tell you the same thing. Lan
has found someone else, too. He said for you to forget him. Better never to have been born than to
love us.” He stepped back again, three long steps, the hall seemed to turn dizzyingly with him in it—
or part of the hall did—and he was gone.
Nynaeve stared at where he had been, and not at the fitfully flickering reappearance of the
damage to the colonnade. Lan had told him to say that?
“A . . . remarkable man,” Moghedien said softly. “A very, very dangerous man.”
Nynaeve stared at her. Something new was coming through the bracelet to her. Fear was still
there, but muted by . . . Expectation might have been the best way to describe it.
“I have been helpful, have I not?” Moghedien said. “Rahvin dead, Rand al’Thor saved. None of
it would have been possible without me.”
Nynaeve understood now. Hope more than expectation. Sooner or later Nynaeve would have to
wake. The a’dam would vanish. Moghedien was trying to remind her of her aid—as if it had not had
to be wrenched out of her—just in case Nynaeve might be steeling herself to kill before she went. “It
is time for me to go, too,” Nynaeve said. Moghedien’s face did not alter, but fear strengthened and so
did hope. A large silver cup appeared in Nynaeve’s hand, apparently filled with tea. “Drink this.”
Moghedien edged back. “What—?”
“Not poison. I could kill you easily enough without, if that was my aim. After all, what happens
to you here is real in the waking world, too.” Hope much stronger than fear now. “It will make you
sleep. A deep sleep; too deep to touch Tel’aran’rhiod. It’s called forkroot.”
Moghedien took the cup slowly. “So I cannot follow you? I will not argue.” She tipped back her
head and swallowed until the cup was empty.
Nynaeve watched her. That much should put her down quickly. Yet a cruel streak made her
speak. She knew it was cruel and did not care. Moghedien should not have any quiet rest at all. “You
knew Birgitte was not dead.” Moghedien’s gaze narrowed slightly. “You knew who Faolain is.” The
other woman’s eyes tried to widen, but she was already drowsy. Nynaeve could feel the forkroot’s
effects spreading. She concentrated on Moghedien, held there in Tel’aran’rhiod. No easy sleep for
one of the Forsaken. “And you knew who Siuan is, that she used to be the Amyrlin Seat. I’ve never

mentioned that in Tel’aran’rhiod. Never. I’ll see you very shortly. In Salidar.”
Moghedien’s eyes rolled up her head. Nynaeve was not sure whether it was the forkroot or a
faint, but it did not matter. She released the other woman, and Moghedien winked out. The silver
collar rang as it hit the floor tiles. Elayne would be happy about that, at least.
Nynaeve stepped out of the Dream.
Rand trotted along the corridors of the Palace. There seemed to be less damage than he
remembered, but he did not really look. He strode out into the great courtyard at the front of the
Palace. Blasts of Air knocked the tall gates half off their hinges. Beyond lay a huge oval plaza, and
what he had been searching for. Trollocs and Myrddraal. Rahvin was dead, and the other Forsaken
were elsewhere, but there were Trollocs and Myrddraal to kill in Caemlyn.
They were fighting, a milling mass of hundreds, perhaps thousands, surrounding something he
could not see through their black-mailed numbers, as tall as a Myrddraal on its horse. Just barely he
could make out his crimson banner deep in their midst. Some swung round to face the Palace as the
gates were hurled asunder.
Yet Rand stopped dead. Balls of fire rolled through the packed black-mailed mass, and burning
Trollocs lay everywhere. It could not be.
Not daring to hope or think, he channeled. Shafts of balefire leaped from his hands as fast as he
could weave them, narrower than his little finger, precise and cut off as soon as they struck. They
were much less powerful than the one he had used against Rahvin at the end, than any he had used
against Rahvin, but he could not risk one slicing through to those trapped in the center of all those
Trollocs. It made little difference. The first-struck Myrddraal seemed to reverse colors, become a
white-clad black shape, then it was drifting motes that vanished as its horse fled madly. Trollocs,
Myrddraal, every one that turned toward him went the same, and then he began carving into the backs
of those still facing the other way, so a continuous haze of sparkling dust seemed to fill the air,
renewed as it evaporated.
They could not stand against that. Bestial cries of rage turned to howls of fear, and they fled in
every direction except toward him. He saw one Myrddraal try to turn them and be trampled under,
rider and horse, but the rest spurred their animals away.
Rand let them go. He was busy staring at the veiled Aiel bursting out of their encirclement with
spears and heavy-bladed knives. It was one of them carrying the banner; Aiel did not carry banners,
but this one, a bit of red headband showing beneath his shoufa, did. There were battles going on
down some of the streets leading from the plaza, too. Aiel against Trollocs. Townsfolk against
Trollocs. Even armored men in the uniform of the Queen’s Guards against Trollocs. Apparently some
who were willing to kill a queen could not stomach Trollocs. Rand only barely noticed, though. He
was searching through the Aiel.
There. A woman in a white blouse, one hand holding up her bulky skirts as she slashed at a
fleeing Trolloc with a short knife; an instant later flames enveloped the bear-snouted figure.
“Aviendha!” Rand did not know he was running until he shouted. “Aviendha!”
And there was Mat, coat torn and blood on his sword-blade spearpoint, leaning on the black
shaft watching the Trollocs flee, content to let someone else do the fighting now that that was
possible. And Asmodean, sword held awkwardly and trying to look every way at once in case any
Trolloc decided to turn back. Rand could sense saidin in him, though weakly; he did not think much of
Asmodean’s fighting had been with that blade.
Balefire. Balefire that burned a thread out of the Pattern. The stronger that balefire was, the

further back that burning went. And whatever that person had done no longer had happened. He did
not care if his blast at Rahvin had unraveled half the Pattern. Not if this was the result.
He became aware of tears on his cheeks, and let saidin and the Void go. He wanted to feel this.
“Aviendha!” Snatching her up, he whirled her around, with her staring down at him as if he had gone
mad. He did not want to put her down, but he did. So he could hug Mat. Or try to.
Mat fended him off. “What’s the matter with you? You’d think you thought we were dead. Not
that we weren’t, almost. Being a general has to be safer than this!”
“You’re alive.” Rand laughed. He brushed back Aviendha’s hair; she had lost her headscarf, and
it hung loose around her neck. “I’m happy you’re alive. That’s all.”
He took in the plaza again, and his joy faded. Nothing could extinguish it, but the bodies lying in
heaps where the Aiel had made their stand lessened it. Too many of them were not big enough to be
men. There was Lamelle, veil gone and half her throat as well; she would never make him soup again.
Pevin, both hands clutching the wrist-thick shaft of the Trolloc spear through his chest and the first
expression on his face Rand had ever seen. Surprise. Balefire had cheated death for his friends, but
not for others. Too many. Too many Maidens.
Take what you can have. Rejoice in what you can save, and do not mourn your losses too
long. It was not his thought, but he took it. It seemed a good way to avoid going mad before the taint
on saidin drove him to it.
“Where did you go?” Aviendha demanded. Not angrily. If anything, she looked relieved. “One
second you were there, the next you were gone.”
“I had to kill Rahvin,” he said quietly. She opened her mouth, but he put his fingers over it to
silence her, then gently pushed her away. Take what you can have. “Leave it at that. He’s dead.”
Bael came limping up, shoufa still around his head but veil hanging down his chest. There was
blood on his thigh, and on the point of his one remaining spear as well. “The Nightrunners and
Shadowtwisted are running, Car’a’carn. Some of the wetlanders have joined the dance against them.
Even some of the armored men, though they danced against us at first.” Sulin was behind him,
unveiled, a nasty red gash across her cheek.
“Hunt them down however long it takes,” Rand said. He began walking, not sure where as long
as it was away from Aviendha. “I don’t want them loose on the countryside. Keep an eye on the
Guards. I’ll find out later which of them were Rahvin’s men and which . . .” He walked on, talking
and not looking back. Take what you can have.

CHAPTER

Glowing Embers

The high window had more than enough room for Rand to stand in it, stretching far above his
head and clearing his shoulders by two feet to either side. Shirtsleeves rolled up, he stared down at
one of the Royal Palace’s gardens. Aviendha was trailing her hand in the fountain’s redstone basin,
still intrigued by so much water with no purpose but to be looked at and keep ornamental fish alive.
She had been more than indignant at first, when he told her she could not go chasing Trollocs through
the streets. In fact, he was not sure she would not be down there now if not for a quiet escort of
Maidens that Sulin did not think he had noticed. Neither was he supposed to have heard the whitehaired Maiden remind her that she was Far Dareis Mai no longer and not yet a Wise One. Coatless,
but wearing his hat against the sun, Mat was sitting on the coping of the basin, talking to her. No doubt
probing for what she knew of whether the Aiel were preventing people from leaving; even if Mat did
decide to accept his fate, it was unlikely he would ever stop complaining about it. Asmodean sat on a
bench in the shade of a red myrtle tree, playing his harp. Rand wondered whether the man knew what
had happened, or suspected. He should have no memory—for him, it never happened—but who could
say what one of the Forsaken knew or could reason out?
A polite cough turned him away from the garden.
The window where he stood was a span and a half above the floor in the west wall of the throne
room, the Grand Hall where Queens of Andor had received embassies and pronounced judgment for
nearly a thousand years. It was the only place he had thought he could be sure of watching Mat and
Aviendha unseen and undisturbed. Rows of white columns twenty paces high marched down the sides
of the hall. The light from the tall windows in the walls mingled with colored light from great
windows set in the arching ceiling, windows where the White Lion alternated with portraits of early
queens of the realm and scenes of great Andoran victories. Enaila and Somara did not appear
impressed.
Rand let himself down by his fingertips. “Is there news from Bael?”
Enaila shrugged. “The hunt for Trollocs goes on.” By her tone, the diminutive woman would
have liked to be part of that. Somara’s height made her seem even shorter. “Some of the city people
give aid. Most hide. The city gates are held. None of the Shadowtwisted will escape, I think, but I
fear some of the Nightrunners may.” Myrddraal were hard to kill, and just as hard to corner.
Sometimes it was easy to believe the old tales that they rode shadows and could vanish by turning
sideways.
“We brought you some soup,” Somara said, nodding her flaxen head toward a silver tray
covered with a striped cloth, sitting on the dais that held the Lion Throne. Carved and gilded, with
huge lion’s paws at the ends of its legs, the throne was a massive chair at the top of four white marble

stairs, with a strip of red carpet leading up to it. The Lion of Andor, picked out in moonstones on a
field of rubies, would have stood above Morgase’s head whenever she occupied that seat. “Aviendha
says you have not eaten yet today. It is the soup Lamelle used to make for you.”
“I suppose none of the servants have come back,” Rand sighed. “One of the cooks, maybe? A
helper?” Enaila shook her head scornfully. She would serve her time as gai’shain with a good grace,
if it ever came to that, but the idea of anyone spending their entire life serving someone else disgusted
her.
Climbing the stairs, he squatted to twitch the cloth aside. His nose twitched, too. By the smell,
whichever of them had made it was no better a cook than Lamelle had been. The sound of a man’s
boots coming up the hall gave him an excuse to turn his back on the tray. With any luck, he would not
have to eat it.
The man approaching up the long, red-and-white-tiled floor was certainly no Andorman, in his
short gray coat and those baggy trousers stuffed into boots turned down at the knee. Slender and only a
hand taller than Enaila, he had a hooked beak of a nose and dark tilted eyes. Gray streaked his black
hair and a thick mustache like down-curved horns around his wide mouth. He paused to make a leg
and bow slightly, handling the curved sword at his hip gracefully despite the fact that incongruously
he carried two silver goblets in one hand and a sealed pottery jar in the other.
“Forgive my intrusion,” he said, “but there was no one to announce me.” His clothes might be
plain and even travel-worn, but he had what appeared to be an ivory rod capped with a golden wolf’s
head thrust behind his sword belt. “I am Davram Bashere, Marshal-General of Saldaea. I am here to
speak with the Lord Dragon, who rumors in the city say is here in the Royal Palace. I assume that I
address him?” For an instant his eyes went to the glittering Dragons twining red-and-gold around
Rand’s arms.
“I am Rand al’Thor, Lord Bashere. The Dragon Reborn.” Enaila and Somara had moved
between Rand and the man, each with a hand on the hilt of her long-bladed knife, poised to veil. “I am
surprised to find a Saldaean lord in Caemlyn, much less wanting to speak to me.”
“In truth, I rode to Caemlyn to speak to Morgase, but I was put off by Lord Gaebril’s toadies—
King Gaebril, I should say? Or does he still live?” Bashere’s tone said he doubted it, and did not care
one way or the other. He did not pause. “Many in the city say Morgase is dead, as well.”
“They’re both dead,” Rand said bleakly. He sat down on the throne, his head resting against the
moonstone Lion of Andor. The throne had been sized for women. “I killed Gaebril, but not before he
killed Morgase.”
Bashere quirked an eyebrow. “Should I hail King Rand of Andor, then?”
Rand leaned forward angrily. “Andor has always had a queen, and it still does. Elayne was
Daughter-Heir. With her mother dead, she is queen. Maybe she has to be crowned first—I don’t know
the law—but she is queen as far as I am concerned. I am the Dragon Reborn. That is as much as I
want, and more. What is it you want of me, Lord Bashere?”
If his anger disturbed Bashere at all, the man gave no outward sign. Those tilted eyes watched
Rand carefully, but not uneasily. “The White Tower allowed Mazrim Taim to escape. The false
Dragon.” He paused, then went on when Rand said nothing. “Queen Tenobia did not want Saldaea
troubled again, so I was sent to hunt him down once more and put an end to him. I have followed him
south for many weeks. You need not fear I’ve brought a foreign army into Andor. Except for an escort
of ten, the rest I left camped in Braem Wood, well north of any border Andor has claimed in two
hundred years. But Taim is in Andor. I am sure of it.”
Rand leaned back again, hesitating. “You cannot have him, Lord Bashere.”

“May I ask why not, my Lord Dragon? If you wish to use Aiel to hunt him, I have no objection.
My men will remain in Braem Wood until I return.”
This part of his plan he had not meant to reveal so soon. Delay could be costly, but he had
intended to have a firm hold on the nations first. Yet it might as well begin now. “I am announcing an
amnesty. I can channel, Lord Bashere. Why should another man be hunted down and killed or gentled
because he can do what I can? I will announce that any man who can touch the True Source, any man
who wants to learn, can come to me and have my protection. The Last Battle is coming, Lord Bashere.
There may not be time for any of us to go mad before, and I would not waste one man for the risk
anyway. When the Trollocs came out of the Blight in the Trolloc Wars, they marched with
Dreadlords, men and women who wielded the Power for the Shadow. We will face that again at
Tarmon Gai’don. I don’t know how many Aes Sedai will be at my side, but I won’t turn away any
man who channels if he will march with me. Mazrim Taim is mine, Lord Bashere, not yours.”
“I see.” It was flatly said. “You have taken Caemlyn. I hear that Tear is yours, and Cairhien soon
will be if it is not already. Do you mean to conquer the world with your Aiel and your army of men
channeling the One Power?”
“If I must.” Rand said it just as levelly. “I’ll welcome any ruler as an ally who welcomes me,
but so far all I’ve seen is maneuvering for power, or outright hostility. Lord Bashere, there’s anarchy
in Tarabon and Arad Doman, and not far from it in Cairhien. Amadicia is eyeing Altara. The
Seanchan—you may have heard rumors of them in Saldaea; the worst are likely true—the Seanchan
on the other side of the world eyeing us all. Men fighting their own petty battles with Tarmon Gai’don
on the horizon. We need peace. Time before the Trollocs come, before the Dark One breaks free, time
to ready ourselves. If the only way I can find time and peace for the world is to impose it, I will. I
don’t want to, but I will.”
“I have read The Karaethon Cycle,” Bashere said. Putting the goblets under his arm for a
moment, he broke the wax seal on the jar and filled them with wine. “More importantly, Queen
Tenobia has read the Prophecies, too. I cannot speak for Kandor, or Arafel, or Shienar. I believe they
will come to you—not a child in the Borderlands but knows the Shadow waits in the Blight to
descend on us—but I cannot speak for them.” Enaila eyed the goblet he handed her suspiciously, but
she climbed the stairs to hand it to Rand. “In truth,” Bashere continued, “I cannot even speak for
Saldaea. Tenobia rules; I am only her general. But I think once I send a fast rider to her with a
message, the return will be that Saldaea marches with the Dragon Reborn. In the meanwhile, I offer
you my services, and those of nine thousand Saldaean horse.”
Rand swirled the goblet, staring down into the dark red wine. Sammael in Illian, and other
Forsaken the Light alone knew where. Seanchan waiting across the Aryth Ocean, and men here ready
to leap for their own advantage and profit whatever it cost the world. “Peace is far off yet,” he said
softly. “It will be blood and death for some time to come.”
“It always is,” Bashere replied quietly, and Rand did not know which statement he was speaking
to. Perhaps both.
Tucking his harp under his arm, Asmodean drifted away from Mat and Aviendha. He enjoyed
playing, but not for a pair who did not listen, much less appreciate. He was not sure what had
happened that morning, and not sure he wanted to be sure. Too many Aiel had expressed surprise at
seeing him, had claimed they had seen him dead; he did not want details. There was a long gash down
the wall in front of him. He knew what made that sharp edge, that surface as slick as ice, smoother
than any hand could have polished in a hundred years.

Idly—but with a shiver, too—he wondered whether being reborn in this fashion made him a new
man. He did not think so. Immortality was gone. That was a gift of the Great Lord; he used that name
in his head, whatever al’Thor demanded on his tongue. That was proof enough that he was himself.
Immortality gone—he knew it must be imagination, yet sometimes he thought he could feel time
dragging at him, pulling him toward a grave he had never thought to meet—and drawing the little of
saidin he could was like drinking sewage. He was hardly sorry Lanfear was dead. Rahvin either, but
Lanfear especially, for what she had done to him. He would laugh when each of the others died, too,
and most for the last. It was not that he had been reborn as a new man at all, but he would cling to that
tuft of grass on the cliff’s brink as long as he could. The roots would give way eventually, the long
fall would come, but until then he was still alive.
He pulled open a small door, intending to find his way to the pantry. There should be some
decent wine. One step, and he stopped, the blood draining from his face. “You? No!” The word still
hung in the air when death took him.
Morgase blotted sweat from her face, then tucked the handkerchief back up her sleeve and
readjusted her somewhat ragged straw hat. At least she had managed to acquire a decent riding dress,
though even fine gray wool was still uncomfortable in this heat. Actually, Tallanvor had acquired it.
Letting her horse walk, she eyed the tall young man, riding up ahead through the trees. Basel Gill’s
roundness emphasized how tall and fit Tallanvor was. He had handed the dress to her saying it suited
her better than the itchy thing she had fled the Palace in, looking down at her, never blinking, never
speaking a word of respect. Of course, she herself had decided it was not safe for anyone to know
who she was, especially after discovering Gareth Bryne gone from Kore Springs; why did the man
have to be off chasing barnburners when she needed him? No matter; she would do as well without
him. But there was something disturbing in Tallanvor’s eyes when he called her simply Morgase.
Sighing, she glanced back over her shoulder. Hulking Lamgwin rode watching the forest, Breane
at his side watching him as much as anything else. Her army had not grown a whit since Caemlyn.
Too many had heard of nobles exiled for no cause and unjust laws in the capital to do more than scoff
at the most casual mention of stirring a hand in support of their rightful ruler. She doubted that even
knowing who spoke to them would have made a difference. So here she rode through Altara, keeping
to forest as much as possible because there seemed to be parties of armed men everywhere, rode
through the forest with a scar-faced street tough, a besotted refugee Cairhienin noblewoman, a stout
innkeeper who could hardly keep from kneeling whenever she glanced at him, and a young soldier
who sometimes looked at her as though she had on one of those dresses she had worn for Gaebril.
And Lini, of course. There was no forgetting Lini.
As if thinking of her had been a summons, the old nurse heeled her horse closer. “Better to keep
your eyes ahead,” she said quietly. “ ‘A young lion charges quickest, and when you least expect it.’ ”
“You think Tallanvor is dangerous?” Morgase said sharply, and Lini gave her a sidelong,
considering look.
“Only the way any man can be dangerous. A fine figure of man, don’t you think? More than tall
enough. Strong hands, I should think. ‘There’s no point letting honey age too long before you eat it.’ ”
“Lini,” Morgase said warningly. The old woman had been going on this way too often of late.
Tallanvor was a handsome man, his hands did look strong, and he had a well-turned calf, but he was
young, and she was his queen. The last thing she needed was to start looking at him as a man instead
of her subject and soldier. She was about to tell Lini that—and that the woman had lost her wits if she
thought she was going to take up with any man ten years her junior; he had to be that—but Tallanvor

and Gill were turning back. “You hold your tongue, Lini. If you put foolish ideas into that young man’s
head, I will leave you somewhere.” Lini’s snort would have earned the highest noble in Andor time in
a cell to meditate. If she still had her throne, it would.
“Are you sure you want to do this, girl? ‘It’s too late to change your mind after you’ve jumped
off the cliff.’ ”
“I will find my allies where I can find them,” Morgase told her stiffly.
Tallanvor reined up, sitting tall in his saddle. Sweat rolled down his face, but he seemed to
ignore the heat. Master Gill tugged at the neck of his disc-covered jerkin as though he wished he
could have it off.
“The wood gives way to farms just ahead,” Tallanvor said, “but it isn’t likely anyone will
recognize you here.” Morgase met his gaze levelly; day by day it was becoming increasingly hard to
look away when he was looking at her. “Another ten miles should take us to Cormaed. If that fellow
in Sehar was not lying, there will be a ferry, and we can be on the Amadicia side before dark. Are
you certain you want to do this, Morgase?”
The way he said her name . . . No. She was letting Lini’s ridiculous fancies take hold of her. It
was the accursed heat. “I have made up my mind, young Tallanvor,” she said coolly, “and I do not
expect you to question me when I have done so.”
She heeled her mount hard, letting the horse’s leap forward break their gazes apart, letting it
shove past him. He could catch up to her. She would find her allies where she found them. She would
have her throne back, and woe to Gaebril or any man who thought he could sit on it in her place.

And the Glory of the Light did shine upon him.
And the Peace of the Light did he give men.
Binding nations to him. Making one of many.
